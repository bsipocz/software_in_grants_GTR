imagining different communities and making them happen.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K002686/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Our research studies how communities connect people, both today and in the past. These connections take many forms, but often include people coming together to seek change and pursue a different future. We are interested in the role imagination plays in how such futures are conceived and pursued. The history of people's involvement in community initiatives includes both successful innovation and frustration and disappointment, in the UK and elsewhere. Our project will learn from both scenarios. We will study community connections in different types of community (some present, some past). Using our new knowledge, together we will imagine how communities might be different and experiment with different forms of community building.

Communities are made up of people who share some things in common, but also have differences. In the light of this we want to ask four main questions: 1) What are the best ways of conceptualising, researching and promoting connected communities so that they have the potential to accommodate and benefit from social, cultural and economic differences and diverse opinions and practices? 2) What does the history of civic engagement tell us about how and why the social, historical, cultural and democratic context matters to community-building? 3) What role can imagining better futures play in capturing and sustaining enthusiasm and momentum for change? 4) Is community research being transformed by developments in research methodologies, particularly the development of creative and collaborative methods?

Our approach to these questions challenges ideas of community that focus on what is lacking, highlighting instead the role that harnessing imagination plays in shaping community futures. It brings together researchers from a range of disciplines across the social sciences and arts and humanities interested in community relationships together with partner organisations dedicated to community development in a range of locations. International colleagues will add further dimensions to the consortium's activities, acting as keynote speakers at events, and as advisory committee members.

The projects will employ a range of approaches to research, but with collaborative and participatory methods (community partners and universities working together) being central. Several projects involve going back to sites of previous research to explore what can be learned that is of relevance to to-day's debates about community. The return to sites of the Community Development Project of the late 1960s/early 1970s will include analysis of background statistics, documentary records, interviews, oral history, community arts and other community-based activities, tracing that history and its legacies down to the present. We will revisit culture and arts projects, and projects working with disadvantaged groups, all of which have sought to promote community resilience. Reflections on the lessons of these experiences will feed into planned interventions with members of 'disadvantaged' communities to fire imagination about the future and help to build resilience and a momentum for change. Another project will investigate what motivates volunteers to cross social and geographical boundaries, using mapping techniques, surveys and focus groups to capture these connections. The context of this proposal is a strong impetus globally towards people looking for new ways to participate in decision-making about issues that affect their lives, and to participate in research that involves them - the so-called 'democratisation of social research'. The various strands of research are held together by the team's shared interests in how people envisage co-operating and how these ideas get put into practice in diverse communities. Answering these questions requires working collaboratively to look at a range of different cases, both past and present, and to draw appropriate conclusions to inform current debates and visions of the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many groups can be identified that will benefit from this research. Most direct beneficiaries are the organizations outside of academia who have already agreed to collaborate with the projects in the consortium, including 37 whose letters of support are included in this application. Others have agreed verbally. Collectively these partners represent a very wide range of organizations including museums and galleries, charities, and national organizations as well as local community-based organizations with established links to both community members and policy-makers. This range of organizations can only grow as the research proceeds. Several of the proposed projects involve re-visiting organizations involved in previous community-university partnerships (such as those in the SECC and Beacons programmes), and further broadening of the network of organizations benefitting from the research will occur through the programme of annual conferences and other dissemination events and through the use of the project website to reach out. In the commercial private sector, efforts will be made to engage with architects and builders involved in community-building and regeneration, through invitations to the conference at which Cheshire will provide an international perspective. Similar invitations will be targeted at public, voluntary and commercial sector organizations in relation to the conferences devoted to collaborative working, fostering historical imagination, democratic methods for researching communities, the sights and sounds of imagined community futures, and comparative perspectives on community dvelopment, all of which will be of interest to commercial organizations in the cultural sector. Finally, beneficiaries will include individuals who do not necessarily have formal links to organizations. The consortium will draw on the wealth of its members' experience of engaging the wider public through dissemination events and other activities.

These diverse groups will benefit in several ways. The most direct of these relate to the outcomes of the projects that involve planned interventions to explore the potential of communities of practice to foster resilience and momentum for change among members of disadvantaged communities. Alongside these projects are others which are also designed to promote active engagement in the process of thinking about different community futures and making them happen. Community relationships are at the heart of people's quality of life, and the promotion of active engagement in community processes has the potential to contribute to this, especially if these activities are inclusive and participatory. In working towards the achievement of this ideal, the consortium's approach emphasises the importance of learning from experience, both the knowledge of previous community development initiatives in the UK and lessons derived through engagement with international partners, who will each make extended visits to allow them to feed in across the consortium. The public policy dimensions of these issues include examination of how community initiatives avoid the well-known pitfalls of 'top-down' processes, while the fact that diverse communities in the UK will be involved will allow direct engagement with the localism agenda. The fact that the consortium's work involves a programme that unfolds over 5 years means that projects later on in the schedule will be able to build on the results of the earlier work, such as the engagement with the Participedia project on participatory politics. These results will be available at the end of year one, and community partners and advisory group members will advise on how best to feed them into the later projects. In this way, the development of skills in more democratic of research among academic researchers and community members will be promoted. Efforts will also be made to maximise the legacy of the consortium's work through creation of durable resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1452732</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A floor game to enable discussion about resilience co produced by a group of young learning disabled people from a resilience co-inquiry project by University of Brighton (PhD project) with Arts Connect, Culture Shift as Community Partner.

The project also has the potential to encourage other communities to research their own history in collaboration with historians and other partners.
One councillor read one of the poems at a community cohesion meeting that the leader of the council chairs in the town hall.
The books have been handed to health practitioners, the chief superintendent of police (Rotherham) and the book was publicised verbally at an event attended by Voluntary Action Rotherham, Rotherham College, the Chief and Asistant Chief executive of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.

The building bridges project will target Rotherham North area which is getting more segregated and creating a culture of them and us leading to undertones of racism in schools and in the community and creating gangs. Through creative methods (film, dance, photography, art, graffiti, poetry and writing) the project will open channel of communication between young people who are on the margins and promote community cohesion. The Imagine project (Rotherham) identified a number of BME young people feeling vulnerable in Rotherham due to racism. 
This new project will help build resilience of young people and support the knock on effect from the CSE scandal, reduce incidents of in hate crime resulting from Far Right marches and also support Muslim young people to resist Islamic extremist rhetoric. The project will bring young people from Kimberworth Park and Ferham, for example to take part in photography or girls from Wingfield and Masbrough taking part in poetry workshops. Another bridge building activity will be working with Mosques and churches and delivering some workshops in faith buildings so young people are more tolerant of other faiths and breakdown the negative stereotypes especially of Islam which is leading to a rise in islamophobic incidents. Young people will be brought together to celebrate Eid and will take part in a question and answer session with a panel of faith leaders, police, and Hope Not Hate. They will train up young people and raise their awareness of Hate crime and how to report it. They will produce young people friendly posters after the training which will be circulated in schools. Some of the young people work in take-away or family taxi firms so they can be advocates in those settings. Once trained the young people will have knowledge to report themselves if they see an incident on a bus or in town. This will increase reporting and active citizenship.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c13e4d33b4f8.71533099-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Zanib Rasool, Community Researcher, was successful in obtaining further funding to help build bridges between young people of different faiths living parallel lives in the town of Rotherham.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Imagine project community researcher, Zanib Rasool, was pivotal in establishing a relationship with the Police Crime Commissioner in Rotherham through her work at Rotherham United Community Sports Trust as a Partnership Development Manager and her links with policy practitioners eg. governing body.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Museums Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Revisiting the modernist dream: Park HIll flats project</gtr:description><gtr:id>76C5B871-54EC-43DD-B0EC-5EAA79DE13A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/a research in progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464c6a8723712.54001200-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Research input, access to archive, access to Weston Park museum as a site for the project film.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The partnership is concerned with a joint project looking at the returning residents of Park Hill Flats.

We made links to local schools and the local college through encouraging teacher visiting. We organised that City College Coventry exhibited the Masterji, Tilley and Blakemore prints until Christmas to extend the exhibition. This meant local schools and college students benefited because they could see the exhibition - for example, the local secondary school studied Hillfields in geography, so the visit to the college would have been very useful historical information.
 
A few photographers came because of the photographers involved. Council officers, including the Deputy Director of Planning, visited. We also received visits from the executive bid committee for the Coventry bid to be 2021 city of culture, including councillors and the chief exec, Andrew Dixon. Whilst he was chatting to me, Andrew called Martin Reeve, the City chief exec, to tell him to visit 'this amazing exhibition'. . Local community development team visited, using it to connect with visiting locals.
 
3rd sector - WATCH recorded some interviews for us as part of our funded agreement with them. These were broadcast on local radio. Love Coventry, a furniture charity, donated sofas, tables etc for the duration. St. Peter's Centre in Hillfields also extended the exhibition outside their community library.
 
We have now exhibited Blakemore and Masterji pictures at Warwick Business School at the university to promote the Coventry 2021 bid. This is through Prof. Jonothan Neelands. You can see some images on my twitter feed @kyneswood.

Critical Considerations for Social Schange Symposium
19 May 2015 to 20 May 2015
Bristol Zoo Gardens; Clifton, Bristol, BS8 3HA, 

How have different societies in different periods thought about 'the future'? What role have different conceptions of the future played in confronting the problems of the present or reflecting on those of the past? What role does the future play in creating and connecting communities? How do narratives across past, present and future cohere? How do societies and communities use and construct utopias and other forms of anticipation to build agency and capacity for change? What impedes or enables these processes?
 
This two-day interdisciplinary symposium aimed to bring together researchers, Civil Society Organisations, NGOs and other groups concerned with questions of social and environmental change, humanitarian challenges, and community empowerment and participation, with philosophers, artists, historians, theorists, social scientists and other disciplines concerned with questions of temporality, futures and utopias.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c73b10725bb1.54401705</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://connected-communities.org/index.php/events/event/utopias-futures-and-temporalities-critical-considerations-for-social-change-symposium/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Patcham House Special Educational Needs School Inset Training Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>70F5FFE7-80C8-4B86-949C-3ED497CAB137</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training for school staff on Resilient Therapy within a whole school approach.

The conference was held at Hinsley Hall in Leeds and our title was 'Lessons and Legacies of the Community Development Projects of the 1970s: Revisiting Benwell, 1972 to 2015'. We drew on recent interviews with residents, community activists, community workers, former CDP workers, politicians and other policymakers to identify and discuss a range of perspectives on the tangible and intangible legacies of Benwell CDP. We showed some short films made in the 1970s, and Gary Craig (who was a former community worker with the Benwell CDP) offered his reflections 40 years on.
In discussions afterwards, many remarked how influential the CDP publications have been in training and education. Indeed, in his latest book, Analysing Community Work: Theory and Practice, Keith Popple (who introduced the plenary) said,
'[The NCDP] was one of the most important and defining initiatives in the evolution of British community development.' (Popple, 2015, p. 34)

The forum was lead by members of the Blackpool HeadStart team (HeadStart is a &amp;pound;75m programme funded by the Big Lottery Fund to build the emotional resilience of young people aged 10-16). The Blackpool HeadStart Partnership shared their resilience model which helps explore potential resources available for young people to build their resilience individually, within their family, school and community. This new and innovative approach to applying resilience theory in practice is highly thought provoking and begins with the question 'What can we change together, so children and young people can flourish and belong?' 25 people attended the forum including a couple of people from Public Health England, who are developing a position statement on Adolescent Resilience to support local authorities to implement their approaches . There were also YoungMinds staff, someone from the Department of Health, a smattering of freelance consultants and NHS doctors and some young people on work experience at YoungMinds from various other London-based charities making up the 25 strong audience. There was a lot of discussion during the forum and the blog enabled people who were not able to attend to hear about the work that the Blackpool HeadStart team were doing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cdd5a54e7260.07848018</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.boingboing.org.uk/index.php/our-blog/220-blackpool-model-blog</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Discussion with Rosie Mockett, Portfolio Policy Manager England Portfolio Development, Big Lottery</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0830B011-E7D1-4D75-8B04-F6ED41753496</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This discussion was concerned with planning a seminar in which evidence from the 'Imagine' project could be presented to people constructing and commissioning projects with communities.

It takes young people with learning disabilities in their last year of education and immerses them in a work setting. It ensures that there is no break for students between school and work, so that students do not become unemployed at any point, and are transitioned into the identity of a working person. Students are based in the workplace and as well as learning English and Maths they learn employability skills and go on work placements every day to prepare them for a real paid job.

This has informed future artistic and creative practice, and I have been invited to take part in a working group exploring the potential for the development of an autonomous civic network running parallel to the internet, with enhanced accountability and respect for privacy.

As the culmination of the And Beyond Institute for Future Research Intersections commission at Primary, this seminar explored how our ideas of the future are culturally constructed and asks what new forms collective imaginings of the future might take.

Featuring presentations and case studies from guest artists and thinkers, and open discussion, the seminar will take the form of a live event simultaneously taking place at Broadway, broadcast online and via twitter.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c73e50992c45.95307504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.weareprimary.org/2015/09/into-the-future-seminar/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Resilient adolescents in an Australian context Forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>127E6FA7-1429-40A3-B86D-D646ACDF49CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hart, A.

The aims were to:
1. Gather evidence-based ideas for what they can do to increase their own happiness
2. Explore ways of applying what they learn to their own lives
3. Acquire ideas about how to share more happiness with those they care about
4. Develop a clearer commitment to taking action to support their own happiness and the happiness of those they care about

They gathered a diverse range of expert speakers and performers for Rethinking the Nation, including bestselling author Joanne Harris, Michael Collins, one of the Coordinators of the UK-based human rights organisation Right To Remain, writer Irna Qureshi, MP and Shadow Minister for Communities and Local Government Liz McInnes and Projects Director for Opera North Dominic Gray, who featured alongside Bhangra dancers and a DJ set on a heritage hifi.

Part of a series that marks the tenth anniversary of the AHRC, entitled The Way We Live Now, the event was designed to pick up on questions about the nation we live in from people on the streets of Manchester and Huddersfield. Those questions were explored from the perspectives of politics, community, visitors and tourism, music and performance, literature and more.

&amp;quot;We hear and read about global migration every day and commentators have some clear ideas about how migration changes &amp;quot;We want to explore who we are as a nation, what this national community is that changes all the time. What do our arts and culture say about us? What influences do we draw on? What do visitors expect to find when they come here? How does our landscape affect who we are as a people? And what kind of community do we belong to? We think the best way to do that is to get questions from a wide range of people and have panellists from a number of perspectives respond to them. The event, in the Imperial War Museum North, combined music, dance, speech and images, explained Dr Matthews: &amp;quot;In the twenty-first century, competing nationalisms, the increasing mobility of populations and globalisation are causing us to rethink traditional ideas of nationhood. This was our chance to do that rethinking in an entertaining way.&amp;quot;
The debate explored contemporary issues of national diversity, conflict and power in the context of changes to the idea of the 'nation'. Covering ground from war to dance and from music to democracy, it used discussion, interviews and live performances to help us think about the way we live now, with each other, and how we talk about our national lives, histories and cultures.
The debate was part of the AHRC Anniversary Debates on 'The Way We Live Now', which are exploring central aspects of our human world, the ways in which they are shaping our lives, and how the arts and humanities help us understand our changing world.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd2f47cba1c5.57274695</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Film Premier: Boingboing Community University Partnership Hits the Road (Brighton) - 28 January 2015 (evening)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F613F19D-FF88-4213-A16B-A2407873395E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An audience of 50 came to watch two short films: 'Boingboing Community University Partnership Hits the Road', about a group of young people and young adults from different community groups in East Sussex who co-curated an exhibition on resilience at a Research Council event in Cardiff with University of Brighton academics, and 'One Step Forward', that charts the journey of a group of young people from the Virtual School for Looked After Children in Brighton and Hove who produced their own beautifully illustrated book about resilience.

The event brought together academics, policymakers, practitioners and members of local community organisations to take a long view of civic participation in their localities. 

The impact was significant in that it showed the potential of communities and universities working together. A member of a local community organization commented: 'Attending this conference is building my confidence and how I can apply the learning in my own community'. 

Patrick Harman, of the Hayden-Harman Foundation, spent four months as a Fulbright Scholar with Imagine NE. He commented:
'My participation in the Imagine workshops and the Imagine-sponsored meeting with the Department of Communities and Local Government has made an impact on my work in two respects. The first is my recognition of the importance of infrastructure organizations in supporting the work of charitable organizations. This recognition has led to our Foundation giving a grant to our local infrastructure organization. The second is an appreciation of the power of partnerships.

At the event, we had many visitors to our stand and this prompted a lot of questions and discussions about the work we had undertaken and how we could build on this going forward. The young people gave presentations and fully participated in showcasing the projects and taking about what they had learnt from being involved in the Connected Communities projects.

Requests to show our exhibition at other venues, marked improvement in the confidence and mental health capacities of the young people involved in the showcase.

The event brought together academics, policymakers, practitioners and members of local community organisations to take a long view of civic participation in their localities. 

The impact was significant in that it showed the potential of communities and universities working together. Comments from the events include:

I think perspective was particularly useful. My role is very here and now, with a heavy dose of future strategy. But I always like to understand what came before, lest we fail to learn and repeat it...it also gave me a deeper insight into some of the personalities and issues that have been around for a while. The project came at a particularly useful time for me as I try to lead our work on tackling deprivation. (Deputy Chief Executive, N. Tyneside Council)

We live in challenging times but there is a lot of positivity, determination and creative ideas and action to overcome the challenges with limited resources (Member of community organisation)

Patrick Harman, of the Hayden-Harman Foundation, spent four months as a Fulbright Scholar with Imagine NE. He commented:
'My participation in the Imagine workshops and the Imagine-sponsored meeting with the Department of Communities and Local Government has made an impact on my work in two respects. The first is my recognition of the importance of infrastructure organizations in supporting the work of charitable organizations. This recognition has led to our Foundation giving a grant to our local infrastructure organization. The second is an appreciation of the power of partnerships. Presentations from these events demonstrated the impacts that collaborations can produce. Consequently, I have been having planning meetings with a local community development financial institution to spur the development of urban agriculture micro enterprises in the neighborhoods where our Foundation works'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b80b2427f476.16198339</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/beacon/ImaginingNorthShieldsReportfinalversion4.5.16.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>co presentation with learning disabled young adults - Connected Communities Conference UEA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4AF65F3-2FE6-4DEA-8E4E-0E16D9B62C3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co presentation with learning disabled young adults presenting their co-inquiry research on resilience: their contextual adversities; what helps them be more resilient; their development through involvement through the collective actions involved in the co inquiry process.

Two school clusters (each comprised of 5x primary and 1x secondary London based schools each), released both a school and parent resprestentative, to attend a six session course to learn about resilience and how to deliver the 'Building Parent Resilience'. They then delivered the course in their respective schools. One session was held in September 2015 and the second in May 2016.

Attendees were very interested in adopting a 'resilience' approach to their work and agreed the need to build parent resilience if parents are in turn to build their children's resilience. Young Minds, a national third sector organisation reported increased enthusiasm for schools working with parents.

The aim of the workshop was to re-examine the achievements and challenges of the Benwell Community Development Project (CDP) of the 1970s, and consider the legacies and lessons for community development and engagement today. Sarah Banks (Principal Investigator of Imagine North East) opened the workshop with an introduction to Imagine North East, followed by an overview of the National Community Development Project of which Benwell CDP was one of twelve CDP projects in the 1970s.

Highlights included hearing the perspectives of former Benwell CDP workers, how the CDP imagined the future and looking at the past and present of Benwell. We also heard critical perspectives from local community organisations and viewed a short film extract from 'Hopes and Fears' - a film made for Imagine North East by young people involved in the Patchwork Youth project in Benwell.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d06709032ad9.52763937</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.imaginenortheast.org/imagining-benwell-workshop-and-exhibition/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Resilience to Reoffending Training</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66317C78-1055-437D-A95B-9F40918F518E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A change in attitudes and behaviour was reported

Community partners shared information about their research activities and involvement in project. The conference comprised presentations, discussion, interactive exercises and workshops. There was an exhibition and display area of community projects which included publications, pieces of art, photos, posters and films. The community radio station from Hillfields in Coventry (HillzFM) set up an online radio station.

Sue Hyatt (Indiana University - Purdue University, Indianapolis) gave an informative and engaging keynote, drawing on her research in the North of England, in Yorkshire and Tyneside, in the 1980s. Sue directly engaged with delegates by asking them to answer a series of questions entitled Activism Allowed. The audience were positively engaged and enthusiastic about activism in relation to the Imagine project and connecting communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5448d919b6cb37.01407068</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imagine Project Newsletter No 3</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>495A9875-86CB-4DAB-B4CB-99B4CE74EF2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Newsletter reporting on news, events, project activities, outputs and findings from the Imagine project's four work packages.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc7ee23c97f3.31286118</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=f658a37aebff2c4a7efad99aa&amp;id=e5f91e0aa3</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Introduction to Resilience seminar (Hastings, England)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8FEE0EF-3654-4412-A940-B633FA0F958D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The introduction to resilience seminar generated lots of discussion and reflective thinking.

The session explored the transformation of mental distress from the exotic unknowable requiring technologies of government and self, available only through Psy practitioners, to a fundamentally social feature of modern living, drawing upon a number of empirical case studies around the UK where opportunities, comfort, a sense of meaning and social support are facilitated for suffering people in a way that statutory and biomedical services find difficult, where environments are presented that provide experiences of help, identity transformation and community without waiting behind a glass partition. Carl suggested a need to step outside the statutory and community institutions of mainstream mental health to explore the ways in which the amelioration of suffering can meaningfully occur through alternative social contexts and community arenas. The presentation was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A.

His talk examined how we can think of musical improvisation as a utopian practice. Engaged further discussion with audience members and fellow panellists about the relevance of utopia for cultural practices.

While utopianism is often equated with idealism, ranging from the romantic to the authoritarian, it is also conversely seen to entail a certain fidelity to the real in the face of misguided ideologies of progress or versions of messianism. Avowing conditions of powerlessness, this symposium explored the notion of 'utopian realism today' as a question of the politics and poetics of hope.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c7401450c118.48179600</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/symposium-utopian-realism-today-aesthetics-and-politics-hope</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy informed discussion with the Chief Executive of Museums Sheffield</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DE5F9D6-EAA5-4210-BD90-2077371EFF14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a conversation with the Chief Executive of Museums Sheffield in which some of the findings of the 'Imagine' project were used to inform the direction of policy initiatives including volunteering projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589de3c1963687.10406866</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding Resilience - International school.

The briefing the team gave to DCLG emphasised the importance of the arts, small scale initiatives and cross community initiatives, all of which were present in the call that they sent out as elements that were seen as important.

Emerging findings include:
? The knowledge in the community (oral, intergenerational, historical, located in practice)
needs to be recognised and valued. One group of women made a book about their
herbal remedies which led to many continuing into further education
? Activism need not be in existing structures, but needs to be nurtured from where women
are, from the bottom up. Local, small initiatives work best for women.
? History matters - the history of the Pakistani heritage community is being lost and their
contributions to the second world war needs to be recovered and valued.
In Huddersfield, community researchers are working with historians to make contributions to historical thinking. Arts and humanities coproduction links academic expertise and community experience to produce robust research conclusions. In this way, individuals develop skills for community development. Emerging findings include:
? Communities are able to articulate their own needs in a variety of outputs and forms, over which they have control.
? Often academics are engaging with already existing community activities - such as flourishing black history month events - so this is about enabling articulation.
? Continuing underrepresentation of BME people in universities and other power structures can be mediated by coproduction to support skills for engagement.
? Coproduction can become the gateway between grassroots and larger cultural institutions such as museums and galleries.
?On Tyneside, community partners and academics from Durham University are looking at perspectives on civic engagement, starting in the 1970s with the National Community Development Projects in Benwell (Newcastle) and North Shields, and reflecting on the past, present and future of their areas through community-based arts and heritage projects. Emerging findings include:
? The value of arts-based activities in promoting inter-generational learning (e.g. graffiti art).
? The value of historical perspectives in re-evaluating the work of community organisations in their neighbourhoods today.
? The potential for changing the practice of museums in response to community-initiated heritage projects
In Brighton, young people are working collectively to create tools to support their resilience framework. A partnership project with the University of Brighton School of Design led to a project called Designing Resilience. Through active interventions by young people and community partners, the resilience toolkit was re-imagined through the process of design. These partnerships both within and outside the university can transform how things happen in mental health services.
Emerging findings this year included the importance of poetry as a mode of inquiry as well as a form of expression, as evidenced by the work of Zanib Rasool and Maggie Laidlaw, researchers on the Imagine project. 
We have also developed ideas around the idea of 'Belonging Maps' and presented our work which has showcased ways of working with communities using tangible artifactual and material resources. These have been trialled in Brighton with researcher Josh Cameron.
We have looked at knowledge production structures in communities and our book 'Re-Imagining Contested Communities' with Policy Press (in preparation) has explored how knowledge is built up within communities.
Our findings this year have addressed the questions that are concerned with how communities can research their own histories and also what methodologies are best for doing that research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We held a policy seminar for the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) as well as the National Centre for Voluntary Organisations research team, to disseminate our initial findings. We have worked closely with DCLG on emerging findings, and the findings of the 'Imagine' project were presented at an event hosted by the DCLG in London, in December 2016. We looked at the knowledge within communities, with a particular focus on Muslim women.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4CE69897-8C7B-474A-9EB5-8E91F0DAF9D3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d059f2e3b986.02037971</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited expert contributor to brief for the USA's Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's funding scheme on adolescence resilience</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4EEEA355-6FC3-425B-A915-A585DA8BBFAA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddccbc484db2.60436496</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited Panel Member for the ESRC's mental health leadership fellow appointment</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>17CDE98A-A85D-4004-B411-CC4099CD02FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ensuring that service users have a strong influence over mental health service provision.

The programme comprises 8 2 hours weekly sessions developed by a partnership of peer trainers, a mental health practitioner and an academic. Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems who are have been recruited and are supported by the local Recovery College which is an established initiative involving a partnership of the health service providers and service user organisations. 

The programme content draws on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aims to increase participants' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they face using internal and external resources and supports.

The Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is the principle funder of the Peer Trainer and mental health practitioner time and course resources. The University of Brighton has funded the time of the academic staff input.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0731300-7D0F-4CB3-8F41-8A4579A1A863</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 8 week course has now been run a total of 5 times across 2 sites attended by approximately 50 people with mental health problems. Initial evaluation (from rating scales and interviews) suggests participants gained both an increased understanding of resilience and capacity to make resilience 'moves' in response to challenges related to mental health problems.

The Peer Trainers - who are involved in other Recovery College courses - have also reported the level of collaboration in design and delivery to be of a 'gold standard' setting a bench mark for other courses. The collaboration has also developed the research capacity of the Peer Trainers who were very valued active participants in the first research conference/event that they had ever attended - The Imagine Project conference/workshops in Huddersfield 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56436b62570d51.65768401</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Late clinical evaluation</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Building Mental Health Resilience Recovery College Course</gtr:title><gtr:type>Health and Social Care Services</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.sussexrecoverycollege.org.uk/courses/west-sussex-campuses/12-west-sussex/103-building-resilience-for-wellness-and-recovery</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2015</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>.

We took the resilience research evidence base and put it together with other sets of ideas gleaned from our practice with very disadvantaged children and families in an NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Clinic. Alongside this, Angie's adoptive parenting knowledge went into the mix and, we've collected experiences from those we are working with in our RT Communities of Practice.

We distilled all these different sets of ideas into a handy RT table that summarises our approach and acts as a reminder to people of what's included. Practitioners and parents use the table to plan strategic moves with children. We've also been developing a version of the table for use with adults, and this is where we've got to so far with that, which is still work in progress, the Resilience Framework for adults. All our tables and frameworks are available as pdfs in the Resources section on the boingboing website - it has also been translated into Greek, German, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.</gtr:description><gtr:id>783EA2B4-F29E-44FD-9EEF-0B924354D051</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Numerous groups have adopted it and used it in various ways.
