Capabilities Approach and Retirement: As part of the research, we conducted a survey of 1600 older workers in the UK and Hong Kong to explore how employer interventions in relation to work, retirement and choices has on quality of life and retirement. The survey has been used by ourselves and a cluster of other researchers. We have found that there is a strong relationship between work choices and positive quality of life. People who report positive work environments in three spheres: working hour flexibility, work content and healthy work environments also report more positive life outcomes. Work choices, in turn, are the result of supportive work environments and having good skills (employability, work specific, and social skill). These results are controlled for income, gender and qualifications. From a practical perspective, the results indicate that employers which provide age positive workplaces will benefit in terms of more motivated and happier workers.

International comparison: The second research objective was to explore the extent of comparability between the UK and Hong Kong in terms of public and employer policies and practices and in so doing to explore the scope for East/West comparability. We found that there are similar drivers for employers to improve age management practices: skills shortages, knowledge management and improving performance. Further, public policies in both contexts are leading toward a privatisation of retirement planning, particularly in relation to savings and pensions. 

Finally, as an added research outcome, we conducted a case study with the NGO Wai Yin in which we found that older Chinese migrants are facing significant barriers to work due to the intersectionality of age, race and migration status. The research found that community activism can help older migrants find and maintain work which they value.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6B49B7A1-F7FA-46C5-B381-95398D352196</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54627a64ee9b76.79430758</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project had two primary objectives: 1) Using Amartya Sen's Capability Approach (CA), to explore the relationship between choices which older workers have in work and retirement outcomes. Due to increased longevity and strains on pension systems across the developed world, governments and employers are interested in developing interventions to facilitate longer working lives include flexible working hours, lifelong learning, healthy workplaces, job rotation, and pension financial intelligence. The effectiveness of such changes is dependent on management process to raise awareness of, encourage and enable older workers to take up changes in work routine as an alternative to early retirement. These include &amp;quot;age aware&amp;quot; senior managers, awareness and understanding of workplace rights as enshrined in employment law and HR policies, the ability to communicate work and retirement plans with one's line manager, and having access to support from colleagues and union representatives. To explore the relationship between work choices and retirement outcomes, we use CA as a conceptual framework in conjunction with life course theory. CA provides the evaluative space with which to explore the freedoms of the individual in pursuing the good (work) life. It emphasizes both freedoms and diversity in exploring agency. More importantly, CA locates agency at the nexus between an individual's commodities (i.e. the set of skills, abilities, experience, etc. which (s)he possesses) and conversion factors which constrain and enable that individual. The purpose of the project therefore is to explore how employer HR policies enhance and/or constrain older workers' choices in work and how such dynamics impact upon retirement plans.
Key findings:
? Recent changes to both state and occupational pensions in both the UK and Hong Kong as well as in the UK laws prohibiting age discrimination and mandatory retirement have been introduced to increase individual choice and encourage extended working life. However, in both contexts, significant minorities of older workers have only impressionistic understanding of the retirement incomes they will depend on once they leave work. Further, measures to restrict early retirement in the UK's public sector pension schemes have led to worries amongst older workers and unions of being &amp;quot;pushed&amp;quot; out of work for performance and capacity reasons.
? Older workers who have remained in work beyond retirement age (64.6 for men and 62.3 for women) tend to articulate greater choice in terms of work than the overall population of people in work 45+. They also reported higher quality of life and greater satisfaction with work and life choices.
? The relationship between workplace choice and retirement outcomes is complex and contextualised by labour market position: those with higher education, higher family income and have uninterrupted career histories articulate more career choices than their contemporaries.
? Individual commodities within the realm of career management is positively associated with extended working life. In qualitative interviews, older workers with a high number of positive work transitions (such as changing employers for a better job) expressed greater confidence in retirement planning and managing late career job transitions than those who had made few transitions. Recent initiatives in the UK such as NIACE's Career Review at 50 programme are geared towards supporting older workers in making job transitions late career.
? Some evidence of collective capabilities was articulated by older workers in three UK case studies (banking, education and migrants) but not the third (social care). In the fourth case study, older workers spend little working time together and therefore had fewer opportunities to act in a collective way. Collective capabilities play out through shared retirement planning, coordinated approaches to managers about work processes, and trade union representation.
2) We have sought to compare age management practices in the UK and Hong Kong. We have found that government in the two governments have taken a largely volunteerist &amp;quot;business case&amp;quot; approach to employer engagement. There has been relatively little cross national comparative research on age, work and retirement, and there have been several calls for more research on employer practices in countries representing different institutional regimes. Previous ESRC research within Europe and between the US and Europe have shown that employers and governments have taken &amp;quot;path dependent&amp;quot; approaches to age diversity shaped by their respective business and welfare systems.
Key findings:
? Government and employers in both economies are taking similar approaches to managing age by shifting responsibility for retirement savings and extended working life to the individual rather than employer. This is played out both within the welfare state (e.g. the development of universal second tier pension funds) and employment law. 
? Both economies are facing significant challenges in responding to ageing demographics particularly in terms of skills and labour shortages. . In Hong Kong, manpower projections to 2018 mean an extra 320,000 workers will be required over the next four years but there will only be an increase of 290,000 people in the same period. In the UK, According to the UK Commission on Employment and Skills UKCES , over the next decade, 13.5 million vacancies will open up, but only seven million school leavers will be available to fill them. 
? Public policies in both contexts are primarily geared toward shifting responsibility for savings and retirement planning toward the individual. Governments in both contexts have established universal second-tier defined contribution pension funds (Mandatory Provident Fund rolled out in 2000 in Hong Kong and the National Employment Savings Trust now being rolled out by 2018 in the UK) with a level of compulsory contribution by employees (mandatory and opt-out respectively) and employers. In both contexts, access to defined benefit schemes are being squeezed by a combination of financial regulations and tax rules as well as employers' reluctance to take on the risks of financing longer retirements.
? Government engagement in both context have been primarily based on taking a light touch approach toward encouraging employers to adopt age positive HRM. The UK government has introduced anti age discrimination regulations (now part of the Single Equalities Act 2010) but this was mainly to transpose the EU Employment Equality (Age) Directive 2001. The UK's introduction and eventual abolition of the Default Retirement Age may offer a pathway for Hong Kong to gradually encourage large employers to raise and eliminate mandatory retirement ages.
In addition to meeting these two objectives, we were able to add a third in exploring the experiences of older migrants and e barriers which they face in terms of employability in later life. We found that they employment barriers in terms of multiple discrimination, acculturation and language. We also found that ethnic community organisations can play an important role in supporting members back into work. 
Key findings:
? Older Hong Kong migrants face significant barriers to employment including those concerning language, acculturation, discrimination and transferability of skills. Of particular importance is how the intersectionality of ageism and racism play out. Economic migrants who have &amp;quot;aged in place&amp;quot; face difficulties in managing unexpected turning points like having to delay retirement for financial reasons. 
? Community activism through ethnic centred organisations plays an important role in supporting older constituents plan for and manage retirement through disseminating information on pension and employment rights; promoting intergenerational social cohesion; and replicating &amp;quot;neighbourhood enclaves&amp;quot; to promote employability within the community.
Methodology and data collection
The project was carried out in three stages. First, interviews with national stakeholders were carried out in both economies. Through discussions with informants in government, trade unions, age advocacy groups and professional associations, we explored how government, employers and NGO's are responding to changing age demographics. Interviews were conducted with the following organisations:
UK
Department for Work and Pensions
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development
Employers Network on Equality and Inclusion
Trades Union Congress
Age UK
Resolution Foundation
The Age and Employment Network
National Institute for Adult Continuing Education Hong Kong
Civil service Efficiency Unit
Hong Kong Institute of HRM
Hong Kong Council of Social Services
Helen Hamlyn Centre

Second, six employer case studies were conducted across three industries. Two of the case studies were selected as representing industrial sectors facing skills shortages (secondary schools and social care services). A third case study was conducted in a multi-national financial institution in two regional offices in the UK and Hong Kong. Within each case study, interviews were conducted with senior managers and HR/line managers. We also conducted group discussions with older workers themselves in which we investigated employment barriers faced by older employees in the respective sectors. Union representatives were also interviewed where available. We also carried out a case study based within a city based community group on older Hong Kong migrants in the UK and employability. In total, seven case studies were completed.
The full list of interviews and group discussions can be found here: www.agediversity.org/esrc.
Finally, we conducted two matched surveys of older employees in the Hong Kong and the UK (800 responses in each country 1600 responses total). The surveys include 186 variables with questions drawn from the Labour Force Survey; European Social Survey, International Social Survey Project, National Adult Learning Survey, and European Working Conditions Survey. Modelled on the Capability Approach, the survey explores the relationship between career trajectories; choices in employment and work autonomy; skills and commodities; employer practices and HR policies; retirement outcomes and quality of life. The surveys were conducted across the UK (including all four nations) and Hong Kong using a stratified methodology to ensure representativeness.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are now working with the DWP, ENEI, Trading Times and Age Action Alliance to use the UK survey data for employer engagement. Specifically, we are developing industry specific literature which will inform employers about the interventions which will enhance older workers' quality of working life as well as encourage phased retirement and/or extended working life. Specifically, we are using the data generated from the survey for the following initiatives:
? A briefing report for trade unions on representing older workers: 
http://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/RepresentingAnAgeingWorkforce.pdf 
? Industrial specific employer briefings on older workers' views on extending working life to be distributed by AAA
? A good practice age management guide for the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives to be distributed by DWP, CIPD, ENEI and other organisations. 
One PhD student is currently enrolled at Middlesex University and is being jointly supervised by Professor Chan and Dr. Flynn. The student, Henry Shei, is conducting research on regulating private sector eldercare in Hong Kong and his research will be used as the basis for a code of practice to be disseminated by the Hong Kong Elderly Commission. Two students have applied to enrol in Newcastle University's PhD programme. The first student has proposed a study on the experiences of older Hong Kong migrants and employability. Her research will build on our study which has identified the central role of community activism in helping older migrants prepare for retirement. The second student has proposed conducting a study within mainland China on work and eldercare using Life Course theory.
As part of a joint conference between Newcastle and Xiamen Universities scheduled for June 2015 entitled China in the Global Economy, we will be conducting a three day workshop with colleagues from across mainland China (XJLU, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Nankai University as well as Newcastle University Institute for Ageing) with the aim of developing a research team to carry out cross disciplinary research on ageing, work and eldercare in China. The research team is now applying for research funding from China's NSFC for a project on eldercare in China led by XJLU with Newcastle University as an international partner.
With colleagues from University of Duisburg-Essen, Mannheim University and Vienna University, we are now organising an application for a special issue on age diversity from an East-West perspective for Human Relations. The proposal is based on symposium which we had organised for IAGG 2013 which drew papers on age and work in the UK, USA, Germany, Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and Japan.
We have also invited academics from both the UK and China (including Hong Kong) with an interest in age and work to explore the survey data with us through two workshops at Newcastle and Lingnan Universities. The aim is to use the data as the basis for an international network of academics from the two countries with a focus on extended working lives from an East/West perspective. Researchers from Manchester, Hull, Cranfield, Middlesex, Huddersfield, Lingnan, Newcastle, and Liverpool Universities, as well as Hedmark University Norway, Hanze University of Applied Sciences Holland, Vienna University Austria, Boston College USA and XJLU China have responded to our call to use our data explore topics including career management, the experiences of older carers, union representation on the age agenda and the regional dimension of ageing in the UK.
