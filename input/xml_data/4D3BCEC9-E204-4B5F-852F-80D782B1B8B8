The high biodiversity of microalgae and their adaptation to a wide range of changing environments has resulted in them containing unique suites of compounds. Certain suites of compounds play a key role in protecting the cell against for example the sun's damaging rays. These same compounds have potential to protect humans and could be used in a range of healthcare consumer products. Currently, microalgae are a relatively untapped source of natural products. The heathcare industry are are looking to nature for sustainable alternatives in a range of their personal care products and microalgae have many attributes that make them particularly attractive. Research at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in collaboration with the Boots Company has revealed that certain species of microalgae contain valuable bioactivity including sunscreen protection and antioxidant activity. This project will focus on optimising the yield of these bioactives and on understanding biosynthetic pathways and interconversions. Results from experimental studies will be compared to those derived from mathematical models and will be used to optimise the yield of bioactives in microalgae grown using photobioreactor (PBR) technology, required for commercial scale production of microlagae. We will also investigate the potential of using waste CO2 and NOx emissions to enhance the growth of the microalgae and assess the impact this has on levels of bioactives. Additionally co-product material, remaining after extraction of targeted bioactives, will be investigated as a potential sustainable source of nutrition for farmed fish.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and carotenoids in microalgae play a key role in protecting the cell against environmental damage. These compounds also have application in a wide range of healthcare consumer products. Preliminary research at Plymouth Marine has recently led to PML Applications and Boots revealing sunscreen and antioxidant activity in extracts of selected microalgal species. To commercialise these results we need a better understanding on the identity, distribution and function of the MAAs and carotenoids and in particular on the transformation and biosynthetic pathways of the MAAs. The overall aim of this project is to optimise conditions for the production of bioactives using PBR technology. Results will provide a clearer understanding on the photophysiological function of these MAAs and carotenoids, important in relation to ecosystem ecology and in response to environmental stressors critical in climate change. It will also provide information essential to optimising conditions for the production of bioactives using PBR technology on a commercial scale. We bring together a consortium to maximise use of resources across all aspects of the project life cycle. PML will undertake the basic research working together with PML Applications Ltd on novel PBRs. Collaboration with Carlton Power will investigate using simulated waste emissions (CO2/NOX) and heat from a gas turbine power station to enhance growth of the microalgae. The University of Plymouth brings expertise on aquaculture and fish nutrition and will assess the potential of co-product microalgal material. The long term aim is to demonstrate the commercial viability of synergistically integrating high value bioactive production, green house gas emission utilisation and aquaculture, in order to provide a model for the sustainable use of resources and the production of natural compounds for well being of humans, livestock and the environment. joint with BB/E018998/1</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43359</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E01898X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
