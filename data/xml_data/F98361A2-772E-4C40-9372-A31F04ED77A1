It involves the upper chambers of the heart, the atria. It is the commonest heart rhythm disturbance experienced by patients worldwide and can lead to significant and distressing health problems, including stroke and heart failure. In an ageing population AF poses an increasing public health burden for the NHS. The longer one has AF the more difficult it is to restore normal sinus rhythm (SR). Those who have continuous AF for longer than a year are described as having long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF). This is the most difficult type of AF to treat and accounts for a significant proportion of all AF patients. Unfortunately the effectiveness of drugs to treat AF is poor and they also carry the disadvantage of numerous side-effects. There are alternatives to drug therapy which involve specific procedures carried out in the heart. Firstly, catheter ablation (CA) - a minimally-invasive technique that uses thin tubes called catheters. These catheters are passed through the skin into veins at the top of the leg and then navigated through blood vessels to certain positions in the heart where heat energy is applied to create scar tissue. The creation of scar tissue is known as ablation and this process blocks the abnormal electrical signals that cause AF and helps to restore normal SR. For patients with early stages of AF (paroxysmal) this procedure has excellent single procedure success rates in the region of 78%. In the population we propose to study, however, those who have had AF for 1 year or longer, the single procedure success for CA ~ 40% [1}. To achieve better success rates requires multiple procedures and for patients this is a significant disadvantage to this approach. The second option is surgical ablation (SA). Traditionally, this involved opening the chest wall and then making multiple cuts in the atria resulting in scars to restore normal SR. Long term results from this traditional surgical approach are excellent (&amp;gt;90% success at 5 years) but because it involved cutting open the chest wall (very invasive) and the fact that it was technically very difficult meant that it was seldomly used. Now there is a newer, keyhole (minimally-invasive) surgical technique that has been developed. This technique does not need to open the chest wall and instead uses small cuts at each side of the chest to deliver heat energy to the atria, as in CA, and causes scarring to appropriate parts of the heart. It offers clear advantages for patients, with greater safety and less discomfort when compared to the traditional SA (open-heart) procedures. However, as CA is less invasive and very effective in paroxysmal AF it is unlikely that thoracoscopic SA will ever play a major role in treating this group of patients. It is in the persistent forms of AF where it may have a role which is why we are studying this group of patients. We believe this method may offer advantages over CA in persistent forms of AF by providing better success rates after a single procedure. At present there are limited scientific data on this keyhole surgical technique in patients with persistent forms of AF. One report demonstrates an 80% single procedure success rate at 1 year which is encouraging [2]. However, the only large trial comparing catheter with keyhole surgical ablation, while showing a 65% success rate, contains mainly non-LSPAF patients and so its relevance for these patients is unclear [3]. As robust data comparing these two types of treatment specifically in patients with LSPAF is lacking, its true role has yet to be established, however, it is in this very group of patients where keyhole surgical techniques may have an important role in the management of AF. Our group has been studying this population to try to determine the best treatment strategy. A key strength of this application is that we have conducted a prelim</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>INTRODUCTION Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia worldwide. Its sequelae, especially stroke and heart failure, cause significant morbidity and mortality, resulting in an increasing public health burden for an ageing population. Long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF) is the most difficult type of AF to treat. For those with highly symptomatic LSPAF successful restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) is highly preferred, but unfortunately, very difficult to achieve with anti-arrhythmic drug therapy (AAD). There are two potential routes to cure. First, percutaneous catheter ablation (CA), which has been well studied. Second, surgical ablation, which comparatively has received less attention. CA applies radiofrequency (RF) ablation to critical areas of the heart to restore normal SR. For early stage AF ('paroxysmal AF') this procedure can deliver 78% success at a single procedure but in later stages, such as LSPAF, the single procedure success for CA is ~ 40% in most studies conducted [1]. Multiple procedures are often required to improve the clinical outcome which is expensive, unpleasant and confers additional risk. There was a historical surgical approach to ablation consisting of multiple surgical incisions (?surgical maze?) to compartmentalise the atrial tissue to restore SR. Long term results from this approach are excellent (&amp;gt;90% success at 5 years), but it was a technically difficult open heart procedure with significant morbidity and mortality and therefore seldom used. Advances in surgery has led to thoracoscopic surgical techniques (closed heart or keyhole surgery) which allows the application of RF ablation (to recreate the surgical incision effect) to be conducted under direct vision without opening the chest. This recently developed technique offers clear advantages for patients with greater safety and less discomfort compared to traditional surgical ablation, but with the potential of recreating its excellent results. As CA is less invasive and very effective in paroxysmal AF, thoracoscopic surgical ablation is unlikely to play a major role in treating this group of patients. It is in the persistent forms of AF where it may have a role which has informed our choice of study population. To date, data on the clinical success of thoracoscopic surgical ablation in treating LSPAF is limited. A non-randomised study in persistent AF demonstrated an 80% single procedure success rate at 1 year (without AAD) [2]. There has one key randomised control trial (RCT) comparing CA with thoracoscopic surgical ablation which unfortunately recruited a mixture of paroxysmal and persistent AF patients (predominantly paroxysmal). Although the results were favourable towards surgical ablation, the procedural methods are heterogenous making the results difficult to interpret [3]. In our pilot study, 21 patients with LSPAF have undergone thoracoscopic surgical ablation and 17 patients have completed 6 months' follow-up with 76% were free from atrial arrhythmia after a single procedure compared with 44% in the catheter ablation group. There were no operative deaths.The preliminary results suggest that the procedure is safe and superior to CA. There is, therefore, a pressing need for a careful, unbiased, prospective evaluation taking into account patient quality of life assessments and a comprehensive health economic evaluation.There are no RCTs comparing these two modalities of treatment specifically in LSPAF. HYPOTHESIS Thoracoscopic surgical ablation has superior single procedure efficacy than catheter ablation in restoring sinus rhythm at one year. AIMS 1. To identify the most effective ablation strategy in treating patients with LSPAF. 2. To relate the effectiveness of the ablation techniques to quality of life. 3. To compare the cost-effectiveness of the two ablation techniques in treating AF.
