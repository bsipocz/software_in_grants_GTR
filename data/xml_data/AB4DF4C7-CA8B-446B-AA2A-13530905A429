PARASITES</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/M010392/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Nematodes (roundworms) are members of the Phylum Nematoda. There are &amp;gt;25,000 species of nematodes and they are outnumbered only by the Arthropods. Their success is due to their ability to occupy a diverse range of habitats. They can either be free-living or parasites of humans, animals and plants. Nematode parasites are a common source of human disease where 1 in 4 people carry at least one nematode species. Human parasitic diseases are mainly restricted to the developing world where poverty, inadequate health care provision, and poor living conditions favour their survival. Some of the most prevalent human nematode parasites live in the gasterointestinal (GI) system feeding on human tissue, blood and gut contents. For example, Ascaris lumbricoides is one of the largest GI nematodes and can cause serious health problems associated with intestinal blockage and impaired growth, especially in children. In livestock, nematode parasites can be a significant problem as they impact not only on the health and well-being of the animal but also on the productivity and subsequent profitability of the farming industry. Haemonchus contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta are the most pathogenic nematodes of sheep and goats. They are blood-feeders and heavy infections can lead to severe anaemia and animal death. Nematodes are also problematic to the crop industry. They can infect food crops such as tomatoes and potatoes or utility grasses including football pitches or golf courses. Meloidogyne spp are a particular problem because they infect a wide range of plant hosts. They impair plant health by setting up feeding sites in the plant root, removing nutrients needed for plant growth.
Unfortunately the drugs that are available to treat parasitic nematode infections no longer work effectively or are environmentally toxic. We cannot continue to treat nematode infections with the current range of drugs and we must now actively seek new drug targets and develop novel drugs. This is particularly important to the UK as we have to ensure the sustainability of livestock farming for future food production.
This project aims to uncover novel drug targets for the treatment of nematode parasites of livestock. In this project we will collaborate with an animal-health pharmaceutical company to accelerate the chance of identifying a novel drug target at which new drugs could be directed. This approach will make use of scientific research skills and the expertise of the pharmaceutical industry in drug discovery. In order to find new drug targets for nematode parasites, we must first identify proteins that are important to nematode biology and survival. Recently there has been an increase in the availability of gene sequences for a number of important parasitic nematodes, like those described above. We will search through these sequences and find those which code for protein targets which may be essential to parasite survival. We will select sequences that are found in multiple parasites so that we can identify a drug target which could be used to treat multiple nematode diseases. We will then use a technique called RNA interference (RNAi) which allows us to switch off genes in the parasitic nematode to find out their function. For example, if we switch off a gene and the nematode dies or stops moving/feeding/reproducing then we have identified a good drug target candidate as the nematode can no longer infect or remain in its host. We will perform RNAi in a model nematode parasite (Ascaris suum) that we can easily collect from pig intestines at local abattoirs and maintain in the lab. Once we have switched off the target genes, we will determine the impact to the parasite by examining how they survive, behave, move, reproduce, and respond to stimulants. We will then select the five 'best' targets, based on their impact to nematode biology, and deliver these to the pharmaceutical industry who will develop drugs against them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Nematode parasites impose a significant burden on human/animal health and global food security. The agricultural impact of nematodiasis in the UK is ~&amp;pound;80 million/year, mainly attributed to animal death, morbidity, reduced productivity and reproductive impairment. Traditionally chemotherapeutics have been the foundation of nematode parasite control, but decreasing utility / treatment failures have exposed the rapid development of drug resistance, including multi-drug resistance such that current control options are not sustainable. As a result, novel chemotherapeutics are critical. In this study we will employ both contemporary and traditional approaches to identify and validate novel drug target candidates for exploitation by our industrial partner. Our target-identification strategy will be directed by the recent progress in parasitic nematode genomics/ transcriptomics and will score targets based on their conservation across the phylum, known druggability in other systems, key role in nematode biology and/or survival, and expression in therapeutically relevant lifecycle stages/tissues. Our approaches to functional validation combine two unique attributes offered by this industrial-partnership collaboration: we will use our newly developed adult A. suum RNA interference (RNAi) platform to investigate target function/importance to parasite biology; uniquely, we will interface these reverse genetic approaches with privileged access to the Merial/Sanofi chemical library, which will provide powerful tools to help steer early target prioritisation and to probe functional importance. The combination of both of these tools will provide a powerful and unique approach to animal parasite drug target validation. These efforts will provide the first target validation platform for an animal parasitic nematode and will deliver five functionally-validated drug target candidates for industrial exploitation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>A. Commercial Private Sector
1. Pharma/Biotech will benefit through economic rewards associated with the provision of a new anthelmintic to a keen market. Our industrial partner (Merial) is committed to developing validated drug targets emerging from this project and exploiting these as screening tools for anthelmintic discovery. This project will also optimise a reverse genetics platform for validation of drug targets in nematode parasites, which will be available for exploitation by other pharma/biotech industries. Additional novel targets arising from this project, which are not of primary interest to Merial, will be available for validation by other industries. This is relevant to those developing treatments for both animal and human nematodiasis, and could provide opportunities for new jobs in the research/development/production pipeline.

2. Local and global farming enterprises will benefit through enhanced economic returns associated with healthier livestock that are more productive. The total income from farming in the UK was &amp;pound;4.7 billion in 2012 facilitating the employment of 481,000 personnel. On a global scale, nematode parasites are estimated to cost farmers $80 million / year. As a direct result of this project, livestock producers will receive economic gain through more effective drugs that are free from resistance. Novel anthelmintics will permit reduced drug treatments, and will enhance animal health, welfare and productivity. Increased productivity will drive economic success in all businesses involved in the 'farm to fork' production process, bolstering the competitiveness of the UK Agri-Food Industry.

B. Policy Makers
1. Stakeholders and policy makers will benefit through research-evidence that will inform policy development:: UK-based government bodies (DEFRA, DARD), Levy boards (EBLEX, BPEX), and other representatives of the Agri-Food industry will benefit as this project will provide an evidence-base for policy development and addreses EU-directed changes in agricultural legislation, e.g. the need for rapid drug-intervention to facilitate 'Sustainable Intensification'.

C. Public Sector
1. Farming communities in developing countries will benefit through enhanced quality of life: Nematode parasites have a devastating impact on agriculture in developing countries where many farmers and their families rely on livestock for income and food. Further, they infect &amp;gt;1/4 of the world's population causing serious morbidity. The goal of this project is the development of novel drugs for the treatment of nematode pathogens in livestock, which has the potential to improve quality of life through enhanced economic gain. Moreover the development of novel drugs for veterinary parasites which can be repurposed for use in humans will improve the health, well-being, and quality of life of those afflicted with nematodiasis.

2. Educational sector will benefit through greater understanding of the local and global significance of nematode pathogens: Local schools will benefit from this research by educating students and teachers about nematode biology, and through raised awareness of the importance of research in our society. In addition, research findings will form the basis of research-led teaching to university students at QUB. The host-institute will benefit through an enhanced research profile.

3. General public will benefit through job-creation and opportunity to promote sustainable prosperity: There is a growing demand from the consumer for organic and chemical residue-reduced food that is produced cost-effectively from animals maintained in a welfare-friendly environment. A novel, resistance-free anthelmintic will facilitate a reduction in drug use, therefore limiting food contamination and facilitating the organic farmer who is restricted to reduced treatment regimes. Also, the environmental impact associated with intensive drug use will be reduced.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>259498</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Cover image for Volume 46, Issue 10 of International Journal for Parasitology - adult Ascaris suum.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5FA80231-1365-4A49-B2E5-EC1264B0AE26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>International journal readership.

Traditional approaches to the discovery, localisation and functional characterisation of nematode neuropeptides have included immunocytochemical techniques, classical biochemical characterisation methods, PCR-based gene detection tools, and muscle-based physiology assays. The data generated highlighted the importance of neuropeptides to nematode biology, and flagged the candidature of the neuropeptidergic system as a putative anthelmintic target. More recently, these datasets have been enhanced by the omic-analyses of nematode genome, transcriptome and peptidome datasets enabling the identification and prioritization of neuropeptides and their receptors that exhibit therapeutic appeal, but are not yet validated. Unfortunately, the development of functional biology tools in nematode parasites has not kept pace. Indeed, a key hurdle to the exploitation of putative targets is the absence of tools that allow the elucidation of target function in therapeutically-relevant nematode pathogens. Broadly, reverse genetics is being applied to probe the biology of many organisms through sophisticated methods of transgenesis, gene silencing (RNA interference), and genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9 technology). The application of these experimental tools to nematode parasites has been eagerly awaited; however their translation has either been difficult or is in early stages of development, such that their impact on novel drug discovery for the control of nematode pathogens is yet to be realised. This presentation provides an overview of Functional Genomics Platforms that are currently available for use in parasitic nematodes, and describes progress in their application to the understanding of the neuropeptidergic system.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a43bf582a7d4.72921409</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2017/03/neuropeptide-signalling/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Society Conference - Evolution and functional biology of neuropeptide signalling: from genomes to behaviour (POSTER, UK, 13-14th March 2017; The development of Functional Genomics Platforms for nematode pathogens: informing the biology of neuropeptides and their receptors)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>722AA20A-202A-4F7A-AC78-932FC6DB41B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Abstract - The neuropeptidergic system is a putative drug target repository for the control of nematode pathogens. Omics approaches have identified &amp;gt;250 nematode neuropeptides, and a number of neuropeptide G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In vivo deorphanisation in nematode parasites has proven difficult; progress is reliant on the development of reverse genetics methodologies which allow putative ligand-receptor pairs to be identified. Ascaris suum offers an opportunity for a novel approach to neuropeptide receptor deorphanisation in a nematode parasite, through the integration of tissue-specific omics-derived data and the ability to probe target-, and tissue-specific gene function. This study describes the identification of neuropeptide/neuropeptide GPCR complements using RNAseq of two distinct A. suum tissues, the ovijector, and body wall muscle (nerve process originating in the body wall innervate the ovijector). 871 genes are overexpressed in the ovijector, including 33 genes involved in GPCR activity. Within one of the largest families of nematode neuropeptides (FMRF-amide like peptides, FLPs), at least five putative flp-GPCRs were identified in the ovijector, and six flps in the body wall that are hypothesised to be their cognate ligands. These data will direct functional deorphanisation attempts in A. suum using RNA interference (RNAi) coupled with a post-RNAi ovijector bioassay.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c17e487c8e58.51279260</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.elsevier.com/events/conferences/molecular-helminthology-an-integrated-approach</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Molecular Helminthology: An Integrated Approach (POSTER, 19-22 March 2017, Cape Cod, MA, USA)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>496A1F68-2B87-4B89-B222-5820EF38073A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Abstract - The future of novel drug target discovery for neglected tropical diseases is reliant on the development of functional genomics platforms in key pathogens. While progress in this area has been slow for nematode parasites, where many species are reported to be intractable to current reverse genetics methodologies, a handful appear compatible with advanced molecular tools. Bolstered by a wealth of genomic/transcriptomic information, and increasing affordability of Next Generation Sequencing, the discovery and validation of novel drug targets is becoming a less distant prospect in Ascaris suum where significant progress has been made in the development of functional genomics tools.
Neuropeptide signalling system biology has been a central focus of nematode drug target discovery. Integrating 'omics' resources in A. suum has provided new opportunities for neuropeptide G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) deorphanisation. In this study we combined the experimental tractability of A. suum with RNA-seq to identify the neuropeptide/neuropeptide GPCR complements of two distinct, functionally important tissues: (i) the ovijector, and (ii) the body wall muscle. Tissue specific RNA-seq libraries were generated (n=3) and analysed using the Tuxedo pipeline. Overexpression and functional enrichment analysis revealed 871 genes overexpressed in the ovijector, including 33 genes involved in GPCR activity. A cohort of at least five FMRF-amide like peptide GPCRs (flp-GPCR) were identified in the ovijector tissue alongside six putative ligands (flps) in the body wall muscle containing the neuronal cell bodies which innervate ovijector tissue. Immunlocalisation studies unequivocally confirmed the presence of specific FLPs in the neuronal cell bodies innervating the ovijector tissue. These data will direct functional deorphanisation attempts in A. suum using RNA interference (RNAi) coupled with a post-RNAi ovijector bioassay. Together these 'omic' approaches bring us closer to the prospect of ex vivo GPCR deorphanisation in animal parasitic nematodes and provide fresh hope for novel drug target identification.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c179e8995982.37538745</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.elsevier.com/events/conferences/molecular-helminthology-an-integrated-approach</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nematode Neuropeptides: From Sequence to Biology and Back (INVITED SPEAKER: Anthelmintics: Discovery to Resistance II, San Diego Feb 9th - 12th, 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ADCE18F9-0C04-4B77-A58D-AEF6CDFF907D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nematode Neuropeptides: From Sequence to Biology and Back

We have maintained a long-standing interest in helminth neurobiology at Queen's University Belfast that stemmed from the early work of Professor D.W. Halton, and continued through research activity in the Maule and Marks laboratories. In the early days, localisation of neuropeptides through immunocytochemical techniques in association with classical biochemical characterisation methods, PCR-based gene detection tools, and muscle-based functional assay systems 
provided data on the importance of neuropeptides to helminth biology, and flagged the candidature of the neuropeptidergic system as an anthelmintic target. Despite this, our understanding of the biology of neuropeptides and their signalling systems, especially in key therapeutically relevant pathogens, is limited. The recent growth in genomic and transcriptomic datasets for parasitic helminths, and positive shift in the cost and accessibility of gene sequencing technologies, provides a welcome gateway to the identification of neuropeptides, their receptors and pathway components. In addition, progress in the development of parasite-focused reverse genetics tools offers the ability to manipulate target function in key pathogens and opportunities for novel anthelmintic discovery. This presentation will provide an overview of the efforts to progress the identification and validation of neuropeptidergic system-derived drug target candidates in nematode parasites, and highlight recent advances in our understanding of neuropeptide biology across the phylum Nematoda.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b2f205acc6.18684562</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral Presentation: American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene: 64th Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, USA, 25-29 October 2015; RNAi competency in adult Ascaris suum - potent, persistent and reproducible knockdown</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>490F1A6A-C48B-471D-A261-1ADF264F5EEF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>RNAi competency in adult Ascaris suum - potent, persistent and reproducible knockdown</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0353ce6de17.52767589</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BALLYCLARE ALC CAREERS EVENT (27TH JANUARY 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A943C43-74E4-41D8-8E87-DE0D85DA57A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CAREERS EVENT FOR KEY STAGE 3, YEAR 6, 7 AND YEAR 8 SCHOOL LEAVERS.

The recent growth in genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets for parasitic nematodes provides a welcome gateway to the identification of putative drug targets, vaccine candidates, and diagnostic biomarkers. Indeed, omics-directed approaches to drug target identification have become widely adopted drug-finding strategies for human therapeutics, and have begun in earnest for nematode parasites where a cohort of 'druggable' targets, believed to have chemotherapeutic appeal due to their predicted 'essentiality', have been identified and prioritized in key nematode pathogens including Haemonchus contortus, Ascaris suum and Brugia malayi through in silico analyses. Despite this, a key hurdle to the exploitation of putative targets is the absence of validation tools that allow the manipulation of target function in therapeutically-relevant pathogens. Reverse genetics tools have advanced to the stage where sophisticated methods of transgenesis, gene silencing (RNA interference), and genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9 technology) are established experimental tools that are being applied to probe the biology of many organisms. Their application to nematode parasites has been eagerly awaited; however translation of these technologies has either been difficult or is in early stages of development, such that their potential to novel drug discovery in the parasitology discipline is yet to be realised. This presentation provides an overview of the genetic manipulation tools that are currently available for use in parasitic nematodes, and evaluates the advantages and limitations of these tools to the discovery of novel control targets.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b351411b54.92088197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>STEMNET / SOCIETY OF BIOLOGY STEM CAREERS EVENT (24TH FEBRUARY 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C544C7A-AAE3-411D-B43B-BEA042E8CC68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture on the Applications of DNA technology followed by careers event.
