These diseases are caused by the formation of abnormal protein aggregates in some brain cells. Aggregates may form locally and spread from their initial location, giving rise to more aggregates distributed through the brain. The first aggregates form in the absence of disease symptoms. Understanding the mechanisms underlying aggregate spread and amplification therefore opens new therapeutic opportunities. We are going to study changes in gene expression in cells forming aggregates made of tau protein and the protein alpha-synuclein. This may tell us more about the mechanisms involved. The formation of tau inclusions underlies a number of neurodegenerative diseases, referred to as tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer?s disease. The formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions underlies Parkinson?s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Recent work by us and others has suggested that non-cell autonomous mechanisms play an important role in the development of most human neurodegenerative diseases. Protein aggregates may form in a localized fashion, from where they spread to distant brain areas, giving rise to clinical symptoms. Together with the existence of a pre-symptomatic, prodromal phase, this opens up novel therapeutic avenues. We propose to use transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify gene expression changes in cells exposed to aggregates of tau protein and alpha-synuclein. Nothing is known about such changes. Seeding will use either aggregated recombinant P301S tau or aggregated A53T alpha-synuclein, in conjunction with lipofectamine. Under these conditions, close to 100% of cells form aggregates 48 h after seed exposure. We developed the relevant cell line models over recent years. We will use untransfected HEK293 cells to investigate if the seed itself leads to transcriptional changes. Transcripts whose expression changes will be identified and their role in the seeding process studied. Total RNA will be isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and its quality controlled using a Bioanalyzer (RNA integrity number &amp;gt;9). Library generation and sequencing will be carried out using the Illumina Truseq kit at the Beijing Genomics Institute in Hong Kong. Reads will be aligned to the human genome using TopHat and the transcriptomes assembled using Cufflinks, before being merged. The reads and the merged assemblies will then be fed to Cuffdiff, which calculates expression levels and tests the statistical significance of observed changes. Data analysis will be performed using CummeRbund. Statistically significant changes (p&amp;lt;0.005) will be extracted from CuffDiff2, based on a Poisson model distribution corrected for both count uncertainty and count overdispersion.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Abnormal aggregation is at the centre of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Propagation and neurodegeneration are direct consequences of aggregation. In recent years, the &amp;quot;prion-like&amp;quot; spreading of protein aggregates has come centre-stage. It is not only conceptually important, but may also lead to new therapeutic approaches. As for prion diseases, distinct strains of aggregated tau and alpha-synuclein may underlie clinically distinct diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and Pick's disease (for tau), as well as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy (for alpha-synuclein). This proposal aims to study the molecular determinants underlying the strain phenomenon in these different diseases and to relate the results to functional and clinical outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4567392A-B0BB-4A61-A5DB-3417F1A87B93</gtr:id><gtr:title>Like prions: the propagation of aggregated tau and a-synuclein in neurodegeneration.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Brain : a journal of neurology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5e863ed595995a076772770d26fdb1ca"><gtr:id>5e863ed595995a076772770d26fdb1ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goedert M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-8950</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b5a46e37b026.93640242</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D43C616-F506-495B-990C-B1592756DC8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer's disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/80be871cf9dfab1312f4e52cb62e3459"><gtr:id>80be871cf9dfab1312f4e52cb62e3459</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fitzpatrick AWP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a81b000bbb147.45672100</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_EX_MR/N027892/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
