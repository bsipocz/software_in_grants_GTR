However, while top international journals in these fields regularly publish quantitative work using sophisticated Bayesian methods, opportunities for psychologists and social psychologists in the UK to acquire skills in Bayesian data analysis are few and far between. Postgraduate social science training in the UK does not typically introduce these methods, while undergraduate and postgraduate training in traditional statistical methods will not cover some fundamental philosophical and statistical concepts necessary for advanced training in Bayesian methods.

Offering training in Bayesian data analysis for psychologists and social scientists therefore involves overcoming a number of barriers. These include the differences in prior training (e.g., those with a basic quantitative social science grounding and those with experience of more advanced methods in a non-Bayesian context) and differences in technical competence (ranging from students familiar with spreadsheets and basic statistical packages to those with experience writing their own computer code for data analysis). However, perhaps the largest barrier is the difference in philosophy between Bayesian and traditional statistical methods. Although the different philosophies have historically been a source of conflict, recent developments in statistical science emphasise the practical advantages of drawing on both sets of methods. We propose a training package that aims to present Bayesian tools as a way to complement and enhance traditional statistical methods.

Our training package comprises a series of four one-day workshops that begin with an introduction to the philosophy and practice of Bayesian data analysis and end with sophisticated Bayesian tools that allow researchers to handle messy real world data that are difficult to model using traditional approaches. Participants may attend one or more individual workshops (e.g., to understand basic Bayesian methods enough to review a paper or improve their collaboration with a more expert colleague) or attend the entire sequence. In addition to the workshops a final symposium will offer an opportunity for research students and early career researchers to present work involving Bayesian data analysis alongside papers by experts in the field. The overarching theme for the symposium is the teaching of Bayesian data analysis. On completion of the project the training resources will be made available to researchers under an open source license in order to facilitate the development of new training and to support the integration of Bayesian data analysis into the curriculum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Training is primarily aimed at UK research students and early career researchers in psychology and the social sciences. The methods we will cover have application in a wide number of disciplines ranging from business and education, through to neuroscience, criminology and political science. In addition to these and other academic beneficiaries, there are wider benefits to government, industrial and third sector partners. Bayesian data analysis has particularly useful applications in dealing with messy real world data with complex nested or cross-classified structure that may arise in workplace settings, prisons and community research (where problems such as missing data are endemic).

We anticipate that many of the research students we train will remain in academia but others will move into industry, government research or applied research (e.g., in professions such as forensic psychology). Researchers from government, industrial and third sector partners may also benefit directly by attending our training. Indirect benefits will be created for end users of research. Bayesian data analysis increases the utility and flexibility of statistical tools available to researchers and has the potential to make more efficient use of existing data (e.g., where standard methods are ill suited to a research question - such as accepting a null hypothesis). There may also be benefits in terms of the reproducibility of the research and the transparency of the analysis if, as we propose, this is built into the research process and research training.

Longer term impacts will accrue from the impact on training on curriculum development and teaching of research methods (particularly at postgraduate level). Our participants will include present and future teachers of research methods - and their repertoire will draw from and be shaped by an understanding of Bayesian methods. The final symposium is intended to further cement and encourage these developments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28256</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bayesian data analysis workshops (2015 to 2016 presentation)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB5AF242-5C74-497C-A8D3-00A1592772BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We planned to run a series of four one-day Bayesian data analysis workshops primarily aimed at UK social science doctoral students (attendance ranging from 14 for the most advanced workshop to over 30 for the introductory workshops). We also ran pre-workshop courses on R and multilevel modelling for participants in response to feedback from the previous round of workshops. The introductory workshops were booked up very quickly and we therefore ran two additional introductory workshops over the Summer to meet demand. The audience also included early career researchers, teachers of statistical methods and a statistical consultant specialising in sports analytics. Attendees travelled from across the UK (including Scotland and Wales). Outcomes varied between participants but included enthusiasm to participate in future workshops, to employ the methods in their own research and to share their learning with others.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c28a082aeb35.56731269</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.priorexposure.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>7th ESRC Research Methods Festival Session (What Role Can Bayesian Methods Play in Resolving the Replication Crisis?)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B26FF4B-FBA2-4F4F-9AA7-D513ADF92DC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were invited to convene a session for the 7th ESRC Research Methods Festival around Bayesian methods and the recent 'replication crisis'. The recent perception of a replication crisis in psychology has coincided with a resurgence of interest in Bayesian statistical methods across the social sciences. Our session explored the role that Bayesian methods have played in debates arising from the replication crisis and its potential for shaping the responses to the crisis.

The session included the following presentations:

Mark Andrews &amp;amp; Thom Baguley What is the replication crisis and why does it matter? A Bayesian perspective
Zoltan Dienes Bayes factors as a measure of strength of evidence in replication studies
Richard Morey The mismatch between statistical thinking and statistical practice
