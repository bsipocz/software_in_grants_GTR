Despite tidal energy being one of the most predictable and reliable source of renewable energy, the cost of the energy produced by tidal energy converters is still very high due to the high costs of the support structures utilised. 
In the present project a disruptive and novel platform configuration is proposed that differs from the other tidal device foundations by virtually eliminating any wet moving part, and therefore lowering the costs and increasing the reliability. It is also designed to avoid the need of costly and scarce specialized vessels for transport and installation. This novel foundation concept will revolutionise the current design philosophy, unlocking new design spaces and opportunities. 
The project will be conducted by an international team with renewable energy expertise. 
Utilising the simple, reliable tidal turbine designed and experimentally tested by Tidal Harness Ltd, Cranfield University will apply its track-record proven expertise in the design of offshore floating structures for the renewable energy industry to this innovative design. 
Tidal Harness Ltd and Cranfield University will be supported by very experienced partners in the renewable energy area: ORE Catapult, DNV-GL, and a strategic partner advising the consortium as regard the manufacturability aspects, Banah UK. 
The Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult is the UK's flagship technology innovation and research centre for offshore wind, wave and tidal energy. Banah UK specialises in a revolutionary new low-carbon cement and will advise to all technical aspects related to methods of manufacturing reinforcement concrete structures. DNV-GL is the world's largest technical consultancy to the renewable energy industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>At the end of the project, the impact of the activities carried out by the present academic partners will be:
- The technical feasibility of the innovative and disruptive support platform configuration for tidal energy converter will be proven, benefiting the naval architect and ocean engineers designing floating support structures for tidal devices, by offering an alternative, more reliable and cheaper alternative.
- A methodology to perform the conceptual and preliminary design of this novel design will be developed and refined, with the contribution of the potential users (Tidal Harness Ltd, Banah UK), of relevant certification/classification authorities (DNVGL), and or the Offshore Renewable Energy CATAPULT research centre. This will benefit the tidal energy industry by confirming the potential to deliver cheaper tidal energy and therefore enhancing the confidence of the potential investors
- The project will deliver a novel contribution, and the arising IP will be secured through patent preparation and filing, benefiting the company investing in this project and providing value for money to the funding research councils.
- The novel design will be able to substantially lower the levelised cost of energy of tidal energy converters, making this technology more economically attractive.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26255</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P510348/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BCCE8AB-CBA5-4D28-9682-5236FE9D0668</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy - Marine &amp; Hydropower</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
