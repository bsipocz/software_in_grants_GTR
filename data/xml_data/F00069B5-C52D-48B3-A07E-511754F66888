It argues that Russia's Age of Reforms (1850s-60s) saw the emergence of new arenas where the spoken word could be used to greatly increased public effect: law courts, local organs of self-government (zemstvos), municipal assemblies (dumas). In addition, pre-existing institutions - the universities, the army, the Russian Orthodox Church - underwent changes that brought new opportunities for public oral communication, or at the very least placed a premium on effective communication. The later nineteenth century was accordingly a period of intense activity in the courtroom, the lecture theatre and the assembly room. It was also a time of intense self-scrutiny as the various practitioners of public speech - lawyers, professionals, preachers, politicians - reflected on how best to get through to their target audiences. Their task became all the more urgent as the Russian Empire entered a phase of revolutionary instability and mass mobilization in the early twentieth century.\n\nThe early Soviet period represented a continuation and intensification of this communicative project rather than a radical diversion from it. The Bolsheviks were from the start believers in the power of the printed word, but, in the Civil War and for years afterwards, they also relied heavily on face-to-face oral communication (known as 'agitation'). In addition, Soviet life - with its grass-roots meetings and public rituals - forced more and more people into the role of speakers as well as listeners. The Bolshevik goal of capturing the minds of 'the masses' was still distant in the 1920s, but in the 1930s it came more sharply into view. The 'Stalin revolution' of collectivization and industrialization had at its corollary in the sphere of mass communication the coming of age of a new medium - the radio - which became an intrusive presence in sites of urban life ranging from the factory floor to the communal apartment. Soviet broadcasting would reach its apotheosis in World War II, when it became the medium of choice for the regime to issue its rallying cries to the population.\n\nThe story of communications in Russia will, then, in part reflect that country's turbulent political history. But it will also shed new light on politics, on society, and on the interaction between the two. Imperial Russia, as it willy-nilly entered the European age of mass nationalism and social mobilization, had to imagine new communities - whether political, national, professional, or religious - and recruit new social constituencies. The proposed study will take its structure from the various efforts in that vein that were made in late imperial and early Soviet Russia. It will examine how lawyers made use of their freedom to hold forth on public matters under the auspices of the jury trial; how priests tried to spread the Word more charismatically to their parishioners; how students, lecturers and politicians attempted to create, and then intervene in, an oral public sphere; and how, for all these groups, the medium of speech interacted with that of print (in particular the mass press).\n\nThe ultimate aims of the project are, by tackling an altogether new subject, to contribute to the debate on the extent of the continuities across the revolutionary divide; to bring the history of communications closer to the mainstream of Russian history; and to put the social and political history of late imperial and early Soviet history in a more thoroughly comparative context.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is designed to bring benefit in the first instance to academics working in the field of Russian history. A further key aim is to help foster dialogue between the fields of Russian and wider European history. In addition, I intend with this project to cross the boundaries between national historical communities, especially those separating the Anglo-American world and Russia.\n\nThe project has the further potential to make modern Russian history vivid and interesting to the general educated public (consisting, among others, of those tens of thousands of people who have studied the Russian Revolution at GCSE or A Level and who buy books on Russian history in later life). It will show the connections between social and political history and make notions such as 'modernization' less abstract and more engaging. This kind of impact can be achieved not only through articles in the press but also through media other than print. The history of radio and the spoken word works well on the airwaves - as a number of BBC programmes on the history of British broadcasting have shown - and I would hope to interest, amongst others, the BBC Russian Service in the findings of the project.\n\nSee my Impact Plan for fuller details.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74794</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with Stephen Lovell (Tallinn)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA2FF7B3-4E64-45DF-B4BB-B18C8783C852</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An online interview I gave to graduate students at the University of Tallinn in advance of my lecture 'From Stenography to Radio' (see other output).
