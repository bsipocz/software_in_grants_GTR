&lt;p>Our study will assess young adult transitions for the 165 Romanian and 52 UK adoptees. Our multi-informant/ multi-method approach will include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>an open-ended semi-structured interview concerning experiences during the transition period&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a structured interview of a range of key young adult outcomes using age-adapted sections of previously validated interviews to identify deprivation-specific and adoption-related issues&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>DNA and stress-related bio-markers. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Qualitative approaches will provide a deeper understanding of experiences of transition and a detailed clinical characterisation. Building on the broader literature we will focus especially on how these individuals (many with histories of deprivation-specific problems) respond to life challenges associated with changes in their circumstances and domestic arrangements during this period that offers great opportunities for growth and independence but also risks to mental health. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>665026</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bucharest Early Intervention Project</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>ERA &amp;amp; BEIP</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E02BCAF-BF8E-4883-83F9-9AFE6B699C4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>non yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ba8b4369a773.36049108-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This is a partnership between the ERA study and the Bucharest Early Intervention study to explore common issues relating to deprivation in two samples of children brought up in Romanian Institutions.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a partnership between the ERA study and the Bucharest Early Intervention study to explore common issues relating to deprivation in two samples of children brought up in Romanian Institutions.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Multiple</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at ACAMH meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63FA0D91-7D85-480E-B6A3-73B24B8473BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk to an audience of clinicians</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ba8e2413ab79.77814030</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Aarhus University talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6B8015E-19E5-49F8-9D1C-E7B99AAB6014</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sonuga-Barke EJS (2015).

The ESRC funded part of this study constitutes the first large scale investigation of their development into adulthood to chart childhood-to-adult developmental trajectories and to enable the assessment of risk and protective processes across the life span. ERA has assessed 165 Romanian adoptees who suffered varying degrees of early deprivation up to the age of 43 months and as assessed their development at ages 4, 6, 11, and 15 years, and now in young adulthood. In general, the study has shown that there is a devastating initial impact of early deprivation on development for nearly all adoptees followed by a remarkable degree of catch-up for many. However, overall half have continued to suffer significant developmental difficulties right through to late adolescence/early adulthood. The ERA study has been one of the most influential studies in developmental psychology and child psychiatry over the last 15 years. It is cited many thousands of times in the literature, discussed in many developmental psychology textbooks, and is now included as part of the A-Level Psychology syllabus in the UK [an overview of the ERA study's findings was invited for publication in one of the U.K.'s leading A-level Psychology journals (Psychology review) with ca. 10,000 readers (Kreppner &amp;amp; Sonuga-Barke, 2016)]. 

The study has a strong track-record both in terms of the dissemination of our findings in high impact academic journals as well as publishing in relevant policy and practice outlets. Importantly, a key impact marker was the publication in 2009, sponsored by the British Association of Adoption and Fostering, of ERA's policy and practice implications (Rutter, Beckett, Kreppner, &amp;amp; Sonuga-Barke, 2009). This was targeted specifically at national and international policy makers, and social care and clinical practitioners working with looked after children. Rutter et al. (2009) identified 45 key messages from the ERA study based on the findings extending into mid adolescence.

We are currently undertaking work on impact of the young adult follow-up with an impact accelerator award from the ESRC and will report the outcomes in due course. 

Initial examination of our young-adult follow-up data suggest the following. Firstly, there is striking persistence into young adulthood in patterns reflective of early onset neurodevelopmental problems for a substantial minority of individuals who experienced prolonged deprivation (e.g., Kennedy, et al., 2016). Secondly, a considerable rate of emotional problems, not present to this extend in either adolescence or childhood, emerged in young adulthood. Thirdly, experiencing early-onset and persistent neurodevelopmental and mental health problems in young adulthood was associated with significant impairment in educational attainment and employment. Finally, and importantly, about a fifth of the individuals who experienced prolonged early deprivation were problem free across all ages and thus constitute a group of individuals who showed remarkable resilience in the face of extreme early adversity. 

Our findings are likely relevant for large numbers of children who continue to grow up in depriving and neglectful conditions around the world. A number of recent studies on different cohorts of children exposed to early institutional rearing and samples of looked-after children have reported similar behavioural and emotional problems (see, for example, Kay &amp;amp; Green, 2016; Levin, Fox, Zeanah, &amp;amp; Nelson, 2015; Merz &amp;amp; McCall, 2010; Wiik, et al., 2011). 

Taken together, a number of important practical implications can be put forward: 

First, child and adolescent services must develop a forward looking strategy to identify the needs of, and put in place appropriate support for, individuals with histories of early institutional deprivation when transitioning into adulthood and adult services. Secondly, the adoptive families likely need support during this transition period to facilitate both, the support of the adoptees and to manage family health and well-being. Thirdly, the relatively high rates of unemployment and low educational outcomes for those with neurodevelopmental problems warrant attention from occupational health services. There is a clear need to raise awareness of the specific needs of such populations and to develop effective ways to support a successful transition to independence. 

These themes and their implication for policy and practice are currently explored in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders (e.g., CoramBAAF Adoption &amp;amp; Fostering Academy and Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, ACAMH) in order to translate the most recent findings from ERA into high impact practice and policy messages. The current dissemination plan includes the following:

a. Publication specific for policy and practice implications

i. General report on policy and practice implications: Similar to our policy and practice implication report based on previous phases of this study (Rutter et al., 2009), we will prepare a report covering the key practice and policy messages from the emerging adult results.
ii. Brief and accessible summaries of the findings tailored to specific groups: We will work with agencies and professional bodies to identify the best way to communicate the key messages derived from our findings to specific stake holders including social workers, clinicians, educationalists, prospective and current adoptive parents, policy makers and adoptees. We intend to make leaflets which are short (e.g. 2 pages) and highly accessible, containing a bullet-point summary of the key messages with web-links to more detailed information. 

b. Meetings and presentations

We have presented and discussed our findings (and continue to do so) through a series of meetings targeted at the different stakeholder groups and organised through CoramBAAF Adoption &amp;amp; Fostering Academy and ACAMH [e.g., at the ACAMH's national Jack Tizard Memorial Conference (June, 2016) and at CoramBAAF (May and June 2016)]. In addition, we plan to organise a national event for key opinion leaders and policy makers to communicate our research findings and the key policy and practice implications of the study. Government officials responsible for transitional care and individuals working with relevant public, private, and charitable bodies will be invited to participate. This event is planned for early 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:id>84DB767F-6205-4F1D-9E20-6B315A9673CC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545a702b58fdf3.05137989</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research investigated the young adult follow-up (ages 22 to 25) of children who experienced extreme deprivation in Romanian orphanages in the late 1980s and early 1990s and were subsequently adopted by families living in the UK. The full sample had previously been studied at ages 6, 11 and 15 years. There had been a devastating global initial impact of deprivation followed by evidence of emergent resilience displayed by many of the children as they grew. Despite this, there was a persistent and distinctive pattern of impairment in a substantial minority of individuals who experienced extended deprivation exposure (i.e., greater than 6 months in the institutions). 
Key findings 
1) Unsurprisingly attrition was somewhat higher than in previous follow-ups. We had data on 76% of the 217 families compared to 90% at age 15. Drop out was not selective for either the extent of deprivation or prior patterns of impairment. 
2) There was continuing recovery from deprivation-related cognitive impairment in the individuals who had experienced extended deprivation. Strikingly, IQ was normalised in those who did not suffer institutional subnourishment. In the most deprived individuals there was an average gain of three standard deviations since entry to the UK. 
3) In contrast, there was a strong degree of persistence in the other three distinctive developmental sequelae of deprivation: ADHD, quasi autism and disinhibited social engagement. ADHD was especially persistent with the inattentive presentation predominant. Clear patterns of disinhibited social engagement and quasi autistic persistence were also observed in the extended deprivation group. There was some evidence that the three elements tended to cluster as a function of deprivation. Evidence of an association between deprivation duration and callous unemotional traits found at age 15 was confirmed in the young adult sample. 
4) Childhood assessments had found little evidence of more general emotional and behavioural problems in the extended deprivation group. However, since age 11 we have seen a substantial rise in emotional problems (low mood, worry and anxiety) -possibly escalating during the adolescent-adult transition. Around half of the extended deprivation group reported contact with mental health services since age 15. Levels of conduct problems remain low with no evidence of aggression/violence or substance use problems. 
5) Early deprivation had long term effects on some general patterns of young adult achievement. Just less than half of the extended deprivation group left education at 16 and over a third were unemployed: Effects that are all the more striking given that the majority of the adoptees' families were from high social class backgrounds/groups.
6) Despite these difficulties, in nearly all cases the families remained extremely supportive of their adopted children providing both substantial practical and emotional support. The vast majority of adoptees regarded their relationships with their parents as close and secure irrespective of levels of deprivation or developmental/mental health problems. Nearly two thirds of the adoptees live separately from their adoptive parents. Just over a third were in relationships and about one fifth had children of their own.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These results have important implications for policy and practice. In highlighting the long term persistence of the impact of extended institutional deprivation on mental health they reinforce the need to; (i) ensure high quality institutional care where it is necessary; (ii) place institutionally-living children in secure long-term family placements as early as possible; (iii) carefully monitor the long-term mental health outcomes of previously institutionalised adopted children as they enter adulthood and; (iv) ensure tailored educational and clinical services and support to the adopted young people and their families to facilitate a successful transition from adolescence-to-adulthood.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E6BB84BB-60E6-4211-9728-F6250BCA360C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a6f683f9bc8.37984720</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3918442B-8380-40C4-9509-68B1BE08FE8C</gtr:id><gtr:title>HPA
