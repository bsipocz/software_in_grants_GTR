Yet, both realizing and understanding collective states of strongly correlated matter remain major scientific challenges. Among the unresolved puzzles, low-dimensional fermionic quantum systems play a pivotal role, because a number of intriguing effects such as high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates, the quantum Hall effect, and Luttinger liquid behaviour are intimately linked to reduced dimensionality. Of particular current interest is the non-equilibrium dynamics of these many-body systems. The understanding of emergent states far from equilibrium constitutes one of the grand challenges in Physics and is of great importance for applications, e.g. for the transport of energy or information in the next generation of quantum devices and in quantum computing. A major difficulty to be overcome is that dynamical experiments in the solid state often are overwhelmed by the strong coupling to the environment and the resulting decoherence destroys the genuine quantum dynamics already on short time scales. 
In recent years, it has become possible to assemble strongly correlated quantum many-body systems in a bottom-up approach using ultracold atomic quantum gases. This novel approach has created the purest and most widely tunable &amp;quot;materials&amp;quot;, in which quantum many-body physics can be studied. They are considered ideal candidates for both unravelling the mysteries of observed, but not yet understood, effects in the solid state and for realizing completely new quantum phases, very much in the sense of Feynman's concept of a &amp;quot;quantum simulator&amp;quot;. Perhaps most importantly, cold atomic gases provide an ideal testing ground for non-equilibrium evolution because the tuneability is very rapid compared to the typical energy/time scales of the system and the dynamics remains coherent for long times by virtue of their weak coupling to the environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. People
Our researchers will receive excellent training in both specialist and general transferable skills. The postdoctoral fellows (and the student) will be trained in state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical techniques. They involve advanced optics, electronics, data acquisition, vacuum science and training in software packages such as Mathematica, Matlab, C++, and LabView. These specialist skills will be indispensable for future jobs in academia or high-tech industries. Excellent training courses in professional and transferable skills are offered by the Department and the University at Cambridge. Topics include planning, project management, creativity in research, communication, presentation and writing skills, research consultancy, assertiveness, innovation, enterprise skills and team work. We will help our researchers to identify the relevant courses for their needs and interests. MK and FE already have alumni pursuing successful and promising career paths both in academia and in industry.

2. Generation of knowledge
Quantum simulation of complex problems of condensed matter physics with ultracold atoms is currently developing into an intensely studied research field. The goal of this fusion between atomic and condensed matter physics is to push forward the fundamental understanding of technologically relevant quantum materials. Quantum correlations and strong interactions trigger the occurrence of new phases of matter which may find their way into applications in our daily life, for example in medical instrumentation. Besides the scientific interest in the fundamental understanding of matter, the ability to engineer, control and exploit such quantum phenomena is one of the greatest challenges of physics in the 21st century. Potential applications include ultra-sensitive sensors and precision metrology at the quantum limit. The research in this field is highly competitive and develops at an amazing pace. Quantum simulations of complex materials aiming at the discovery of the origin of high-Tc superconductivity are in full accordance with the priorities of the UK within the &amp;quot;Europe 2020&amp;quot; strategy. One key goal of this research proposal is to contribute to a more resource efficient, greener and more competitive economy by deepening the understanding of transport phenomena in complex materials. This could help to transmit power and/or information using less resource. Further, this project aims to contribute to an economy based on knowledge and innovation.

3. Cross-pollinating scientific communities
Our research lies at the interface between solid state physics, atomic physics, and quantum engineering. In the UK, the ties between these communities have intensified over the past years, in particular in view of non-equilibrium complex systems and simulations of complex materials using quantum gases. We are well connected with the UK quantum gas community. MK is member of the EPSRC-funded network UKCAN for research at the interface of cold atom physics and condensed matter physics. This project will strengthen relations with key groups in the UK working in diverse fields of research. 

4. Technology
The instruments we will build during the grant and the methods we will develop almost certainly will have potential for a successful commercialisation. The group of MK has a very strong record of successful commercialisation of instruments. For example, a former student of MK's group runs an enterprise (Qubig GmbH), which has specialised in manufacturing precision equipment for laser spectroscopy. These components, originally developed for solving specific research tasks in the lab, are now sold and distributed worldwide. This directly results in economic benefits arising from fundamental research and we are continuously collaborating with Qubig with regards to new commercialisation opportunities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>472014</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1D0B65B8-7689-4776-A0D6-5A811AFBB56C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relaxation dynamics of a Fermi gas in an optical superlattice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a71cf004e6c08e7506ed0b178d72b5eb"><gtr:id>a71cf004e6c08e7506ed0b178d72b5eb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pertot D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675f8e6a9603</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D0FCC9EA-048A-42AB-A097-F1F0884DABDD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Two-dimensional Fermi liquid with attractive interactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/75578d6175a11d3b138226e2a8e5c1ff"><gtr:id>75578d6175a11d3b138226e2a8e5c1ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fr?hlich B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d5186bac435.85531760</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J01494X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B0D65A04-1D90-417F-9589-EA58474E36E3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cold Atomic Species</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A2FF150-B3DF-4C8F-A44C-1EBF60BAFC60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Condensed Matter Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
