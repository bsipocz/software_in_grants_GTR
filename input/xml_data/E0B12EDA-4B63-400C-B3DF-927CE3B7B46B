parasites in the long-term absence of sexual reproduction</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/J01933X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Sex is embarrassing for evolutionary biologists, who have struggled for decades to explain why almost all animals and plants engage in such an inefficient activity. In principle, females could transmit their genes with 100% efficiency by producing identical clonal daughters. Sex, by contrast, reduces a female's genetic stake in each offspring to 50%, with the remainder supplied by a male who shares few of the production costs. Given this twofold disadvantage to sexual females, why aren't all organisms asexual?

One leading idea is that a lack of genetic variation leaves asexual populations vulnerable to diseases. In this view, colourfully named the 'Red Queen hypothesis', parasites and pathogens are constantly evolving to overcome the immune defenses of their hosts. Sexual hosts can fight back with new combinations of defensive genes each generation, allowing them to keep up with parasites in an endless co-evolutionary race. However, asexual hosts have no way to change their outdated defences, and are doomed to be overtaken and exterminated. Consistent with this view, lineages that completely abandon sex almost inevitably go extinct soon after, and evidence suggests that disease plays a role. However, there is one remarkable and informative exception.
Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic freshwater invertebrates that abandoned sex and males more than 30 million years ago, but have persisted and diversified into more than 450 species. Their success has been called 'an evolutionary scandal,' because sex was believed to be indispensable. They appear to refute the Red Queen hypothesis, as they suffer from a range of deadly fungal parasites, but have not been driven extinct as predicted. Should we abandon this otherwise promising hypothesis? What if bdelloid rotifers have found unusual alternative ways of dealing with parasites? If so, their asexuality may actually strengthen, rather than challenge the Red Queen hypothesis.

I am investigating whether unique aspects of the bdelloids' lifestyle help them stay ahead of parasites without needing sex. These animals can tolerate complete desiccation, allowing them to thrive in tiny, ephemeral patches of moss and rainwater. When dry, they form miniscule particles that can be transported by wind for hundreds of metres. Crucially, however, their parasitic fungi cannot withstand this process. In principle, therefore, a bdelloid clone could leave its co-adapted parasites behind, and disperse to a new habitat patch where the local parasites are less well-adapted. If these migrations happen often enough, parasites in any patch will be exposed to a constantly changing array of host genotypes, just as if the bdelloids were having sex.

I aim to test this intriguing scenario directly. I will use genetic 'barcodes' to identify and track bdelloid clones as they migrate among patches of moss in UK woodland. I will test whether bdelloids from the same area differ in their resistance to fungal parasites, and determine whether the rotifers or their enemies are 'ahead' in the race. I will set up sterile, elevated patches of moss in the field, to see how quickly they are colonised by windblown bdelloid clones. Some of these new patches will be seeded with parasites, to determine whether their presence favours rotifers with specific genetic immunities. Results will be compared with theoretical work that describes the patterns to expect if bdelloids are indeed playing an ecological game of &amp;quot;hide-and-seek&amp;quot; with their parasites.

If confirmed, this would be a fascinating and unprecedented solution to a universal problem, throwing new light on the role of dispersal in co-evolutionary dynamics. It would also reconcile the 'scandalous' bdelloid rotifers with the Red Queen hypothesis. Alternatively, if this promising scenario is refuted, the bdelloids' success would become even more mysterious and intriguing, forcing a serious reconsideration of the supposed vulnerability of asexuals to parasitism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries include:

Academics &amp;amp; Research Council: The project targets a long-standing problem in evolutionary biology, and involves an unusual group of organisms that generate high-profile interest among geneticists, physiologists, zoologists, limnologists, etc. Data will have value to theoretical and applied ecologists interested in processes driving spatial and temporal diversity. Isolates, specimens and sequences will be useful to taxonomists and molecular ecologists. The prime impact is thus to generate knowledge and understanding, as described in the previous section. The project addresses NERC's mission &amp;quot;to promote and support...high-quality basic research...in terrestrial biology&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to advance knowledge...and to provide trained scientists that meet the needs of users and beneficiaries&amp;quot;.

Higher Education: In the USA, I supervised 8 undergraduate and thesis-level research students over 4 years, training them to use the bdelloid-parasite system. I have worked with 3 UK Masters students since my return. Students learned and applied techniques including microscopy, aseptic culturing, DNA extraction, statistics, etc., in the context of a real biological problem. They generated data which were subsequently published, either as theses or as part of peer-reviewed papers (e.g. Wilson 2011, Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 104: 564). Young scientists seem enthusiastic about the system (e.g. 12 MSc students have conducted 5-month projects on bdelloids at Silwood in the past 7 years, 3 involving parasites). I anticipate similar interest in projects linked to this proposal, and I am happy to contribute training that will advance their scientific competitiveness. I am especially keen to help students improve their scientific writing; teaching this highly transferable skill was my special focus at Cornell.

Pest management: Bdelloids and their fungi are not economically important, but their unique characteristics reveal fundamental properties of host-parasite evolution, especially the relative roles of recombination and dispersal in resistance to parasites. The concepts in this project have significance for pest managers wishing to protect monocultured or clonal host species, or control asexual crop pests biologically. Potential impact in these areas will be realised by communicating results at topical meetings of mycologists and crop scientists, who can then apply the insights to target systems.

Public understanding of science: There has been considerable public interest in the evolution of sex, parasites and the weird lifestyle of bdelloid rotifers. The proposed work contains all of these elements, and will make an excellent vehicle to increase public knowledge and understanding of evolutionary biology, ecological dynamics, and microscopic biodiversity. I communicated my early results in 2010 to a US and global audience via national radio, podcasts and online videos, and major newspapers and magazines in over 14 languages. However, the story was not picked up extensively by the UK media at the time, so the UK public will hear about the work at an even more exciting stage, as more definitive results come in from the currently proposed project.

Secondary education: In 2010, I was involved in the Cornell University Institute for Biology Teachers, which forges links between active researchers and schools. I introduced the bdelloid-parasite system to teachers, and during subsequent workshops we developed plans to use these organisms in practical lessons. Bdelloids and parasites are found everywhere, and can be studied with little more than a student microscope and agar dishes. Feedback confirms that students and teachers alike were fascinated to discover the lethal, alien drama that plays out beneath their feet. By replicating and extending this outreach to receptive schools in the UK, I will offer biology teachers an accessible, exciting system in which to demonstrate principles of microscopy, ecology, parasitism and taxonomy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280653</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Jagiellonian University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Poland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wastewater treatment- Institute of Environmental Sciences, Krakow</gtr:description><gtr:id>DCF1DF86-C40F-4A41-BF51-A205411EE541</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing collaboration in both directions.

Audience members from whom I requested feedback reported an improved understanding of the importance of genetic diversity in resisting disease, and the principles of natural selection.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d1da841d4a65.98651057</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/lates</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Scientific training:
The grant has helped me provide training and laboratory experience to ten postgraduate students, four undergraduates and one Key Stage 4 work-experience student. The Masters students helped generate data (described in Key Findings) that form part of upcoming publications, which will help them compete for jobs in the academic or private sectors. Three have already been co-authors of published conference abstracts, and six have also secured PhDs. 

Secondary education:
In accordance with my Pathways to Impact plan, I have worked with a corporate partner (Exscitec, Ltd) to develop and deliver a STEM-related activity to over 100 students from six schools and academies around Inner London. The focus has been on schools from historically disadvantaged areas, and those with female students, to help foster a diverse representation among future scientists. I have been introducing students in Key Stages 3 and 4 to principles of genetics, evolution and microscopy via the rotifer research funded by this award. These activities helped increase interest in STEM careers and biological sciences among traditionally under-represented groups. Feedback was collected from students who participated in the workshops and was very positive. I have subsequently returned to one of the Exscitec partner schools five times to help with preparation for higher education. The students I mentored went on to secure places studying STEM topics, including at Oxbridge. 

Public engagement:
My work has recently been featured at some length in a book, published in the UK by a British author (http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/sex-on-earth-9781408193419/). I have also used my findings to update publicly available knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia. I have organised several public outreach events around this research theme, including an evening on the topic of sexuality at the Science Museum, and microscopy activities for the general public at several open days.

Commercial Wastewater Management
As part of this award, I have collaborated with researchers in Poland to characterise fungal pests that interfere with commercial wastewater processing by killing rotifers that provide debulking services. This collaboration included a two week Polish-funded placement in my lab for a visiting researcher, promoting cross-EU knowledge exchange. The results obtained from our collaboration are being used to identify problematic fungi in Polish wastewater treatment plants, and the relevant organisms have been isolated and catalogued in culture collections for the first time.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>605EF0E4-83DE-4D3E-BDD7-0F527BA335B7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545a15631306f5.80698638</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic animals that live in almost every pond, puddle and patch of moss in the world. Over 400 species have been described, and millions of individuals examined, but surprisingly, all are female. Males have not existed for millions of years; the females lay unfertilised eggs that hatch into identical asexual daughters. Their success puzzles biologists, because asexual groups are thought to lack the genetic variation needed to diversify and adapt to changing conditions. This award has enabled me and my collaborators to understand how these unusual animals have persisted in the face of ever-changing threats, especially infectious diseases. The results of our fieldwork and genetic sequencing have shed light on the role of variation in responding to environmental change, the relationship between hosts and parasites, and one of the Big Questions in biology: the purpose of sexual reproduction itself. 

We have shown that bdelloid rotifers have been coevolving with virulent fungal parasites for approximately 50 million years despite their lack of sex. We reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of fungi that attack bdelloids, dated using a fossil from amber. One group, Rotiferophthora, is 46.2 million years old. Using experimental cross-inoculations and infectivity modelling, we demonstrated that Rotiferophthora and bdelloids have been reciprocally coevolving. Because rotifers are transparent, we could even see the infection and resistance mechanisms at work inside their bodies. Our finding of ancient and sustained resistance to fungi seems to challenge the hypothesis that males and sex are required to keep up in an evolutionary race with lethal pathogens. We suggest that bdelloids are dealing with pathogens using unusual genetic and ecological mechanisms, which we went on to investigate. The work achieved two further aims. Because obligate parasites cannot have diversified before their hosts, our work established a new minimum age for bdelloid rotifers as an asexual group, pre-dating previous estimates by 25 million years. We also developed a new lab model for fungal disease in animals, with advantages including clonal reproduction, long-term frozen storage, and direct visualisation of immune responses. 

In field experiments, we found that wild rotifer populations commonly escape from fungal epidemics by drying up and blowing away. When their habitats desiccate, the rotifers survive by entering a dormant state, and are blown like dust on the wind to colonise new habitats. However, their fungal parasites cannot survive or travel without water, and are destroyed. We used direct trapping to show that wind-blown rotifers migrate rapidly: a genetically diverse immigrant community can be established within just three weeks. This result supports a theoretical model suggesting that asexual populations can persist if they rapidly escape changing diseases in space and time. If so, bdelloid rotifers may actually be an exception that proves the rule: they avoid diseases in a different way from sexual organisms. 

We also reconstructed relationships for other major fungal parasites of rotifers, revealing six independent origins of parasitism. Many arose in fungal groups that usually attack other hosts, including plants and nematodes. This suggests that animals without sex may be quite vulnerable to acquiring new diseases, even from distantly related hosts, and that ecological opportunity is a key factor in pathogen host shifts. The data also help fill evolutionary gaps in the relationships of economically important pathogenic fungi that attack plants or insects. I am now collaborating with researchers at Princeton to apply some of the same techniques to study host-shifts in human pathogens, including malaria. 

Other outputs include the discovery of six new species, two new genera and one new family. I collaborated with Polish researchers to identify fungal predators destroying beneficial rotifers in commercial wastewater treatment plants. We also discovered an unusual mechanism of disease resistance, in which asexual rotifers infected with a fungus sometimes spontaneously die in order to prevent the fungus from reproducing and killing their whole population. This mechanism has been described in bacteria before, but not in animals. 

In sum, the work has helped test and update current thinking about the long-term effects of genetic diversity on adaptation to disease. It supports the view that sexual reproduction facilitates long-term coevolution with parasites and pathogens, but reveals that other ecological strategies also can help compensate for lack of genetic diversity. It has shed new light on the diversity and host range of pathogenic fungi.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One key outcome is a new experimental system that combines an under-studied class of pathogens (fungi) with a historically under-studied group of animals (Spiralians). The bdelloid-Rotiferophthora system is highly tractable and well characterised phylogenetically and phenotypically. It is now available for work on the evolution, ecology, physiology and molecular biology of immunity. Workers in Belgium, Germany and Poland are already following up on our results. The key question we now opened up for investigation is whether bdelloid rotifers show exotic genetic mechanisms that compensate for their lack of sex by generating immunological diversity. 

A future focus is the interaction of bdelloid rotifers with bacterial pathogens. The fact that bdelloids are capable of coevolution across macroevolutionary timescales raises some exciting hypotheses about potential chemical interactions with bacteria, and I have already applied for further funding to take this forward. 

Our main result highlights an oblique technique for establishing the age of important groups that do not fossilize well. We were able to establish a robust age for bdelloid rotifers by relying on molecular dating of their obligate parasites. We hope this will guide similar approaches in other groups.

Our findings are already being used by applied researchers in Poland to improve the control of fungi that destroy rotifers in commercial wastewater treatment plants. 

I am applying the techniques and theory I developed during this work to a collaboration with researchers at Princeton, looking at host-shifts in primate malarial parasites.
 
Our fungal sequence data and culture materials will certainly be used in future by anyone studying the evolution of economically important biocontrol and plant-pathogenic fungal pathogens in the order Hypocreales.

The new understanding of coevolution and ecology in this asexual system will interest agricultural scientists working on biological control of major crop pests called root-knot nematodes (RKN). Many RKN antagonists are related to the rotifer-killing fungi we characterised, and many of the most damaging RKN species also are obligately asexual. Increased regulation of chemical nematicides creates an economic incentive for biocontrol, and revealing how bdelloids defy their fungal enemies gives valuable guidance in maximising the impact of fungal pathogens on RKN. I have established contact with tropical nematologist colleagues at Syngenta and IITA to take this forward.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A0C08603-4D2F-42C4-ACFD-270224030FEB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a0cd532dcc3.27606269</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_11-7-2013-12-50-10</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>research culture</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEA0F4BA-064F-43CF-9928-5BD048F27579</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a2fe295026.53400713</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2016/09/early-career-researcher-conference/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset records the responses of various rotifer clones to inoculation with different isolates of the fungal pathogen Rotiferophthora, at multiple timepoints.
