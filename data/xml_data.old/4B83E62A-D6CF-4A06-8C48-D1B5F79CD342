For officials and professionals, as well as for lay people, it made clear that younger civil partners were, in the main, supportive of the institution of marriage which they believed was becoming 'more equal' and inclusive. The event also indicated how seriously personal networks (families, friends and colleagues and so on) took civil partnership as a form of marriage, as well as decreasing but continuing hostility against same-sex couples. Many attendees, including registrars, service providers, local policy makers, wedding service providers, and health and social care workers discussed the possible implications for them of how younger same-sex couples now has the 'right' to be treated as 'ordinary' married couples.

After the study was completed, which was partly focussed on the ways and the extent to which younger same sex civil partners saw themselves, and lived, as 'ordinary' married couples, same sex marriage was introduced in the mainland UK in 2014. We do not claim that the research influenced this, but our research had preempted this and out webpages, presentations, publications and media appearances provided a timely resources that enabled professionals and wider lay audiences to grasp the significance of this for the changing nature of marriage and its everyday implications same sex couples. 

In fact, in 2013 we published the 'full' analysis of the the research findings, in the form of a book entitled 'Same Sex Marriages'. While there is evidence of the use of the work by legal experts (e.g. Daniel Monk), family researchers and methodologists (e.g. Jacquai Gabb), and support (e.g. Damien McCann) and advocacy groups (e.g. Lesbian and Gay Foundation), as well as the media (e.g. BBC Radio 4, THE, Pink Paper), we expect that the research will have further scientific and social impact as the realities of same same marriage becomes embedded in everyday life, not least because the research itself was mostly concerned with the everyday negotiations and challenges that younger same sex partners encounter as 'married' couples.

We are presently maximising the potential for more impact by: writing additional articles in journals, magazines and blogs; continuously updating our project webpages; presenting new aspects of analysis to specialist and more general audiences via conferences and other events; continuing to develop and distribute targeted findings to specific policy makers, organisations practitioners, service providers and the communities that were researched.

We have - and continue to- collaborate with Policy@manchester to engage policy audiences and with the press officer at the University of Manchester to make specific aspects of our findings more broadly available to the media.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A6D91D21-000A-47E9-8686-63811BD80AF5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464ba7c701838.87886011</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Cultures and practices of commitment
Couples' cultures and practices of commitment were informed in ongoing conversation between the marriages partners' grew up with (mostly the parents'), the marriages they 'lived by' (or marriage ideals) and the everyday circumstances and contingencies of their own 'marriages'. In this respect and others there are notable similarities between civil partnerships and contemporary heterosexual marriages.

'Mature' and enduring commitments
Most couples entered into civil partnership to express (to each other, their families and friends) the 'mature' and loving nature of a well established relationship and their long-term (or even 'permanent') commitment to it. For the majority, legal 'rights' and protections were a secondary consideration, although immigration (n=8) and joint parenting recognition (n=6) were primary considerations for some. 

Ordinary marriages
Couples mostly viewed and presented themselves as 'ordinary married' couples. They deployed the language of marriage to describe formalising the relationship, the nature of the commitment and their relating practices. The legal distinction between civil partnership and marriage was mostly viewed as insignificant (8 partners wanted formal marriage, 7 did not). 

Socio-cultural change 
Civil partnership signals how the meaning of marriage is increasingly open to interpretation 'on the ground', and how same sex relationships can be experienced as relatively ordinary. Most couples reported that their 'marriages' were accepted in daily life and formally (by law and policy) and informally (by family and personal communities) supported. 

Continuity
Partners' accounts of their 'marriages' were embedded in relational biographies and in comparisons to their parents' relationships. These signalled continuities in the ideals of a 'good' marriage (which parents often failed to achieve in practice): based on love, enduring commitment, mutual care and support, equality and respect, ongoing communication and stability. 

Distinctiveness
Partners displayed a greater degree of critical reflexivity about their parents' marriages than previous cohorts of heterosexual newly-weds. However, unlike previous cohorts of same sex relationships they deployed generation over gender and heterosexuality (or heteronormativity) to interpret different roles, decision-making and relationship-defining power in their parents' relationships. 

Gender, sexuality and beyond
Everyday marriage practices did not follow gendered norms, but neither did they operate according to a distinctive same sex relational ethos. Power in core areas of practice is not reducible to gender and/or sexual identity.

Finances
The typical arrangement was to have a joint account for joint costs, combined with separate current accounts for independent spending. How individuals related to money was a foundational element in their relationships. Debt was a dominant framing reference for how respondents regarded money, their relationship with it, and the practicalities of their financial arrangements. 

Sexual commitments 
Most couples were sexually monogamous (45). Concerns about sexual compatibility could frame insecurities and anxieties about the relationship. Both men and women could see unequal 'sex drive' as a potential threat to the relationship. 

Family-making
Family commitments were couple-centred and children centred where they existed. They mostly included family of origin, but not friendship-based chosen families. Seven female couples had children. Men were less likely to see parenting as part of their relational future and had less than realistic plans when they did.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research could be used by:

by a wide range of organisations and services that come into contact with same sex couples, so as to inform their practice (health, support and social services, family counsellors and psychotherapists, parental advisors and so on)

by lesbian and gay support and service organisations to understand the significance that social differences (e.g. class, race, age, geographical locations, disability and so on) make to same sex couples experiences of family and couple relationships.
