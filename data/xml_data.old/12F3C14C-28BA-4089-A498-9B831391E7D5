The project seeks to harness efficient new technologies, and help to reduce the cost and environmental impact of shrimp farming to place the industry on a more sustainable footing both economically and environmentally.

Previous studies have indicated that shrimp aquaculture in Malaysia is intensive, but less productive than neighbouring countries including Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam (Thean et al, 2016), which has led to a focus on potential measures to boost productivity, including by improving farm management practices and the deployment of resources (Gazi et al, 2014). Due to the importance of agriculture to the Malaysian economy (approximately 7.2% of Malaysian GDP in 2010 and contributing 10.9% of total employment), and with the identification of low productivity and quality as a key challenge (MARDI, 2015), this project has the potential to make a significant contribution as a route to improving shrimp farming processes.

The project will address the following research questions:

- What are the detailed characteristics of a micro-bubble aeration system in terms of its operational capabilities? (Off-field test based study)
- What is the suitable micro-bubble aeration system and configuration for a nursery pond of shrimp Aquaculture? (Off-field test based study)
- What is the energy/power requirement of a micro-bubble aeration system? (Off-field test based study)
- What is the effect a micro-bubble aeration system on bio-floc and its circulation? (Off-field test based study)
- What is the effect of a micro-bubble aeration system on water quality and shrimp growth? (On-field test)
- What is the effect of a micro-bubble aeration system on water effluent? (On-field test)

The outcome of the project will be disseminated to the Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry, and then to the shrimp industry more broadly. This dissemination activity will be based on sharing the evidence gathered in the field test in Malaysia, and will include measures of shrimp farming productivity, energy and water use, and effluent reduction, in order to promote the potential of the project outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this project are shrimp farmers in Malaysia, and the government bodies which oversee the agriculture and aquaculture industry. 

The project seeks to harness and optimise new technologies, and to reduce the cost and environmental impact of shrimp farming in order to place the industry on a more sustainable footing both economically and environmentally. The aim is to develop a micro-bubble aeration system to improve water cleanliness, quality and shrimp growth, and to support the circulation of bio-floc, whilst operating at the same or reduced energy requirements.

Previous studies have indicated that shrimp aquaculture in Malaysia is intensive, but less productive than neighbouring countries including Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, which has led to a focus on potential measures to boost productivity, including by improving farm management practices and the deployment of resources. The project has the potential to contribute to the improvement of shrimp farming processes, which is especially significant given the importance of agriculture to the Malaysian economy.
