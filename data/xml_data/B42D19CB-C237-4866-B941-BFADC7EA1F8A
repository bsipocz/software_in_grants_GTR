The driving ambition of the network is to establish and build the intellectual foundations and academic and non-academic network necessary for a future comparative research project with associated methodologies to be submitted as a large grant or centre application.

The network will assemble a highly international group with academics, policymakers in international aid agencies (the World Bank, the IMF, the UNDP and UNDESA) and bilateral aid agencies and networks (the UK-DFID and the OECD-DAC) and civil society organisations from emerging economies (via Oxfam's Inequality in Emerging Powers Civil Society Network), bringing together perspectives from political science, economics, public policy and development studies. The network will also actively disseminate the research to a wider academic, policy and civil society audience via a dedicated website, social media and academic associations. These different stakeholders will co-produce the new research agenda.

The network will be based around the following activities: a launch meeting and two substantive international workshops, a set of papers for a journal special issue and accompanying briefs, and a set of concept/regional and country notes; a dedicated website with project outputs and annotated literature searches; literature summaries and relevant datasets.

The proposal is directly and primarily relevant to the development challenges of the countries listed because it is about maximising poverty reduction; the project is about inclusive - shared - economic growth and is concerned with maximising the poverty reducing power of sustained, structural change-driven economic growth. 

The project addresses a point of tension in the developmental objectives of these countries around inclusive growth and structural change which are linked by the dynamics of inequalities. The project will help understand better the inequality dynamics of inclusive growth and structural change and in particular identify how and what policy interventions governments of globalised economies can introduce or adjust or change to seek to balance their developmental objectives of inclusive growth and structural transformation, maximising poverty reduction and attaining the sustainable development goals that relate to poverty.

The following countries will directly benefit: India, China, Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa and the Philippines. This list of 7 countries is home to two-thirds of the world's extreme poor. The project would also be of relevance to a range of other new middle-income developing countries as well as established middle-income developing countries. It will also be of relevance to low-income or least developed countries considering pathways and policies for inclusive growth, structural economic transformation and poverty reduction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this network?

The beneficiaries of the network will include the researchers and research users involved such as the World Bank, the IMF, the UNDP, the UK-DFID, the OECD-DAC and Oxfam's Inequality in Emerging Powers Civil Society Global Network and the broader staff of these organisations as well as the wider academic community (globally and in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, the Philippines and South Africa) working on issues of poverty, inequality and economic growth and economic development in the fields of economics, political science, public policy and development studies. There is demonstrable interest in the organisations listed above evidenced by publications in the case for support. However, there is no current network to bring these actors together. The network will also benefit those working directly in policy formation, and policy advocacy in the set of seven emerging economies, other emerging economies and also in the planning of development strategies of the poorest countries.

How will they benefit from this network?

The academic community and research user community outlined above will benefit from the new knowledge generated in terms of their understanding of the state of the art in the area and what governments can do to maximise poverty reduction in terms of policies. The agenda-setting papers in the journal special issue and their accompanying one-page briefs will provide the main content to do this. Additionally, the academic and policy community will benefit from the building of a database on the dedicated network website which will include existing evidence summaries, papers and datasets on the issues and annotated literature searches on specific sub-questions (using Web of Science and Google Scholar); key concept/regional/country notes summarising literatures on specific questions and links to relevant datasets (with user instructions). The policymaking and policy advocates community will benefit from the briefs in particular. The policymakers from the IMF, World Bank, UNDP, UK-DFID, OECD-DAC and civil society will be embedded in the network as co-producers of the research agenda and producers themselves of concept notes and regional or country notes. The website will also include regular blogs, and op-eds by network members which will be of use to policymakers and policy advocates and the Twitter account will direct those who follow the account or retweet to relevant papers, blogs, policy briefs, media pieces and datasets.

What is the relevance of the network to beneficiaries and potential for impact?

The network's relevance to beneficiaries is that it addresses head-on the nexus of poverty, inequality and growth and how governments maximise poverty reduction. The impact of the network in terms of academic impact (agenda-setting, citations and interest in the network's work and future work) will be via the set of papers in the special issue and the website database. The outcomes will disseminate to the wider academic and policy and civil society community via the website and Twitter and other social media. The impact of the network in terms of research users will be via a set of accessible evidence pieces - summaries, briefs, blogs, and op-eds - written for those working in policy and policy advocacy in civil society organisations in terms of what governments can do concretely to maximise poverty reduction. These will have the potential for impact via dissemination and percolation into policy debates in the seven countries directly covered in the network and in international agencies by the embedding of policy and civil society actors in the network itself.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151623</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P006299/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B33D3534-9854-416D-9412-CB4F732D0410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol.,International Rel.&amp;Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A2961412-FA64-4331-A882-DA219AC99567</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social policy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
