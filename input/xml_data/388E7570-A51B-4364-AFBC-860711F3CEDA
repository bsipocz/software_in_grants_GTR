When asked to think about politics in the UK, many people would recall images of the Prime Minister standing at the dispatch box, clashing with the Leader of the Opposition over topical issues. Similarly, many key events in the political calendar - the Budget, the Queen's Speech - revolve around large, high-profile debates on the floor of the Commons. 

However, aside from these limited cases, most parliamentary debates pass unnoticed by those outside of Westminster. This is unfortunate, as parliamentary speechmaking is a central democratic responsibility of elected politicians, and debates provide MPs with the opportunity to scrutinise government policy, and to voice the concerns and interests of their constituents.

Political scientists have made a great deal of progress in analysing parliamentary debate in recent years, with significant attention devoted to using speeches to uncover underlying ideological preferences of MPs, or estimating the priorities that MPs place on different policy issues. However, while these features of political debate are important, when politicians speak, they are usually doing more than expressing their position on an ideological spectrum, or adding to the volume of words uttered on a given topic. Rather, politicians use speeches for a wide range of purposes: to influence the course of debate, to provide responses to questions, to persuade their audience of particular view point, and so on. 

This project moves beyond existing research by developing new ways to extract meaning from the speeches made by politicians. To do so, I will design new statistical methodologies for understanding three different features of political speech. In particular, I will develop methods to measure: 

1) how responsive ministers are to questions put to them from backbench MPs,
2) which politicians are influential in parliamentary debates, and 
3) how MPs use rhetoric to make their speeches more persuasive.

I will apply these new methods to the full collection of parliamentary debates from the beginning of Clement Attlee's government in 1945, to the end of the 2015 legislative session. Applying new measures to this large collection of political speeches will add depth to our understanding of the ways in which MPs deliberate over policy, and thus will provide new insights into the legislative process in the UK. Have ministers become less accountable to the legislature over time? Are different MPs influential in different policy areas? Has the style of parliamentary rhetoric changed in recent years? These are the questions that this project seeks to answer.

More generally, the explosion of digitised political text online provides an excellent opportunity for us to better understand the ways in which our democratic representatives navigate the policymaking process. The methodologies developed in this project will contribute to a growing area of research that provides tools to capitalise on these new sources of data, with the aim of improving our knowledge of the behaviour of political actors. 

There is a strong appetite amongst the public and journalists for information about how MPs act and interact in parliament. As evidenced by popular websites like TheyWorkForYou.com and PublicWhip.org.uk, data resources and statistical summaries of MPs' behaviour play a key role in public oversight of political figures. This project will increase the ability of politically-engaged individuals to understand the legislative behaviour of members of parliament. In doing so, it will also provide new insights about what politicians say, and the motivations behind why they are saying it.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I aim to maximise the social impacts of this project by engaging with a range of non-academic beneficiaries. I identify three broad user-groups for this project: the public, journalists, and MPs themselves. 

First, recent research demonstrates that members of the public are interested not only in the partisan dimension of UK politics, but also in the behaviour of the individual MPs (Wagner and Vivyan, 2015). While parliamentary debates are available online, the sheer volume of text makes it difficult for politically-engaged members of the public to navigate and interpret the speeches of any particular MP. This project will make it easier to understand the speechmaking behaviour individual MPs, by providing the context of more general patterns of legislative debates in the UK. For instance, rankings of the most 'influential' MPs in each policy area will help citizens who are interested in lobbying parliament to gain a better impression of which MPs they might contact. This information might also be used to discover which debates in a given policy area contain the most 'influential' speeches, and therefore are worth reading in full. 

More generally, I will write a series of blog posts for the LSE's popular Politics and Policy blog, which will explain my findings in clear and accessible prose. I have extensive experience producing public-interest blog posts about my work, many of which have featured in the national and international media. The posts I will write for this project are likely to be syndicated to other high-impact websites, and will therefore provide a richer stock of information about the actions of our democratic representatives than is currently available on the public record.

Second, the use of statistical data in journalism has increased dramatically in recent years, and this project will have both short- and long-term impacts on political journalists. In the short-term, the blog posts produced for this project will be published under a Creative Commons licence, which will allow them to be edited and reproduced in a wide variety of media outlets. In the longer-term, this project will develop the understanding and use of text analysis methods in journalism. Often, research informs journalism by providing findings that can be written up as news stories. This project aims to go further by helping journalists to overcome the technical barriers that stand in the way of them using quantitative text analysis methods themselves. In addition to presenting my work at a national newspaper, I will spend time working alongside data journalists to better understand their methodological needs in this area. To this end, the methods I develop will be made freely available in a popular statistical software, alongside a series of tutorials, which will help lower the costs for collecting and analysing political speeches.

Third, MPs often seek sources of information that help them to communicate their activities to their constituents, and to explain the roles they play in parliament to a wider audience. This research will provide new information to MPs about how their speechmaking behaviour compares with that of their colleagues. To disseminate my findings amongst politicians, I will hold an event in the House of Commons, which will serve two main purposes. First, it will allow me to share my findings with a broad group of interested parliamentarians and party officials. Second, it will allow me to canvas a group of MPs about their experiences of participating in parliamentary debate, and supplement the quantitative analysis at the heart of this project with qualitative evidence from MPs themselves. Baroness Smith, Leader of the Labour Party in the House of Lords, will host this event. The support of a leading political figure is indicative of the growing interest amongst UK politicians for empirical analyses of parliamentary debates.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>184857</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This package provides an R binding for the TheyWorkForYou API.
