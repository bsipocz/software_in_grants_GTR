In practice however K is frequently insufficient to draw any such definite conclusion about A so instead we may adopt heuristics in place of sound rules to assign (or at least constrain) a degree of belief, or (subjective) probability, to A consistent with the knowledge K.The primary objective in this proposal is to investigate some such heuristics within the formal framework of Predicate Probability Logic, or more specifically Polyadic (Carnapian) Inductive Logic, which are justified by appeal to their `rationality' (or more commonly the irrationality of flouting them), namely the observance of principles based on symmetry, relevance and irrelevance, and in turn to investigate the extent to which adherence to such principles can completely determine the assigned probabilities. Despite their frequent use in everyday reasoning formalizing and understanding the contentof these three notions within the framework of Inductive Logic turns out to be a much more subtlequestion than it might at first appear. This is, for example, illustrated by the numerous paradoxes in Philosophy (and hence indirectly the related `reasoning sciences' such as AI) which are associated with their naive application, paradoxes which, as a secondary objective, we would expect this research in part to demolish. Our recent research has shown that even though `symmetry' has an apparently clear mathematical meaning at a deeper level this is somewhat at odds with it's intuitively acceptable application as a rational principle of belief assignment. For example situations which whilst apparently entirely symmetric as far as the mathematics is concerned may lead to unacceptable conclusions if treated equivalently viz-a-viz the assignment of probabilities. Similar discrepancies concerning the notions of relevance and irrelevance have been highlighted in our earlier work for purely Unary Inductive Logic.For example the ostensibly reasonable assumption that knowledge bases from entirely disjoint languages should be irrelevant to each other leads, mathematically, to conclusions which we would normally wish to reject. In short we would argue that even in the rigid framework of Inductive Logic we do not understand these three notions as manifestations of rationality. The wider purpose of this project is toshed some light into this darkness.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>289935</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The proposal was to investigate rational principles of (A) Symmetry, (B) Relevance, (C) Irrelevance, within the context of Pure Inductive Logic.

(A): An entirely new symmetry principle (PIP) was discovered and shown to imply Spectrum Exchangeability, and a family of probability functions (which importantly includes the extension of Carnap's Continuum to the Polyadic) described. We conjecture that this gives a complete characterization of the probability functions satisfying this principle. To date PIP is the most powerful rational symmetry principle which is provably non-trivial.
 Additionally we gave a complete characterization of the (polyadic) probability functions satisfying the symmetry Principle of Constant Exchangeability (Ex). This is actually a very significant result firstly because Ex is essentially always assumed and secondly because the form of the representation result makes it very easy to use (just as de Finetti's Theorem in like circumstances). It has already proved to have many applications which would not have been possible without it.

(B): Three new relevance principles were introduced, investigated, and completely characterized. Two of these concern how much a past observation should affect one's current beliefs, the principles saying that it should always have some effect but that in time this effect should become zero in the limit. This was an important aspect of relevance which had not previously been considered in the context of Pure Inductive Logic. The third principle (AP) proposed attempted to capture the idea of analogical support. The conclusion that this could hold only for very special (and hardly rational) probability functions was important because a number of such principles had been proposed elsewhere by researchers and this showed that their intuitions were in many cases flawed or lacking.

(C): An elegant characterization of the polyadic probability functions satisfying the Weak Irrelevance Principle (WIP) and another paper comparing the unary restriction of this family to Carnap's Continuum was published. This was of some interest because these two ideas (WIP and Johnson's Sufficientness Postulate) have to date formed the backbone of examples in the field.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Apart from (A)-(C) a significant section of the research monograph `Pure Inductive Logic' (with the supported RA) was written during the time. This definitive 350 page volume is the first in the area and (hopefully) will motivate and influence the subject over the next decade at least. It is intended not just for mathematicians but also philosophers and, with its emphasis on patterns of rational reasoning and belief formation, AI researchers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5D1482A4-A547-4589-BD07-423DBD4AFDD2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cdc11b790e66.88056441</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information
