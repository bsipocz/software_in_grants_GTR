While the impact on society of population ageing and increasing longevity has mainly been studied in terms of demographic and epidemiological significance, there are important changes among other groups not conventionally associated with ageing. These groups, the 'new' ageing populations (NAPs), consist of individuals born with, or later contracting, serious health conditions that previously had prognoses of early mortality. These individuals can now expect to survive into early adulthood, if not mid- to late-adult life. This development mirrors conventional ageing in terms of growth in total numbers, proportions of adults surpassing proportions of children with the same 'life-limiting' diagnosis, and an age-associated increase in the burden of disease as well as increased family support.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The numbers in these groups are growing as is the range of conditions involved and length of life. These developments have occurred through both intended and unintended consequences of biomedical intervention together with contemporary changes in social attitudes and social contexts. While these changes have enabled better health, wellbeing and longer length of life, this shift into older ages has brought psychosocial uncertainties into the experiences of NAPs and those responding to them. Ageing of NAPs raises significant questions for how adult ageing with a life-limiting condition is experienced.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15439</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>134772</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Adult survivors of childhood liver transplant : personal narratives of an emerging 'new' ageing population</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>RES-062-23-3363</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>9FD51889-31A6-4FAE-8463-ABC144BF3993</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ebcd4ac5ebcd4c0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In total, 330 delegates attended the seminar series, representing academics, students, third sector agencies, health and social care professionals, service users and interested members of the public. Seminars 1 and 2 were predominantly attended by gerontologists; seminars 3 and 4 by those interested in the history and social implications of NAPs, and seminar 5 by those interested in practical issues arising in health and social care. 
There are a number of early and anticipated impacts to date:

Lowton and Higgs have been awarded an ESRC research grant Adult Survivors of Childhood Liver Transplant: Personal Narratives of an Emerging 'New' Ageing Population ES/J002445/1. This award has arisen directly from one of the themes considered by the seminar series. The 18 month award commenced on 2nd January 2012 and we are currently interviewing members of the first cohort globally to receive liver transplants in childhood.

New Ageing Populations has now been listed as a theme for the Annual Conference held by British Society of Gerontology (2012).

Lowton and Higgs have contributed two book chapters:

Higgs (2012) Later life as an arena of change in Researching Later Life and Ageing: Expanding Qualitative Research Horizons Leontowitsch M (ed) Palgrave Macmillan

Lowton (2012) Reconceptualising Later Life: Using Qualitative Methods to Refine Understanding of New Ageing Populations in Researching Later Life and Ageing: Expanding Qualitative Research Horizons Leontowitsch M (ed) Palgrave Macmillan

Higgs' presentation at the Healthy Ageing Research Unit at Monash University led to suggestions for future ERA conferences to include new ageing populations as well as providing links between Australian and UK researchers.

Through the series' collaboration with Biocentre (Matt James), one Institute of Gerontology masters student has became involved in co-organising Biocentre's conferences including The 21st Century Body (May 2012).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>256DAA22-0611-4C6B-B2CC-723221ECB6C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54621493bcc584.84935176</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the seminar series was to map the nature of rapid recent growth and ageing of populations not normally associated with old age and explore the implications that arise from this. We aimed to explore these implications through concepts and theories from the humanities and social sciences, the responses of individuals, families, professionals and wider society, and by drawing on empirical health and social care research and professional and user perspectives. At each seminar we aimed to bring together leading researchers with stakeholders, user groups, practitioners and policy makers. Overall, the seminar series demonstrated how difference disciplines and approaches were all becoming aware of the transformation of ageing and its more diffuse nature. Third sector organisations and health and social care professionals were also becoming more aware of the issues that challenge many underlying assumptions, whether they were in the field of disability, chronic illness or indeed in sexual health. The high level of attendance at some of our seminars, with one attracting 130 delegates, clearly demonstrated growing awareness and interest in these issues.
Our seminar series was very well publicised through a wide range of platforms: JISCmail lists; BioCentre; British Society of Gerontology's internet-based Generations Review newsletters; Ageing Well Network newsletters; Centre for Ageing Research and Development in Ireland (CARDI); The Association for Education and Ageing; King's Health and Society Centre newsletters; Ageing Research at King's; and UCL Crucible and Provost's Newsletter.

We held five seminars over two years:
1: Why study New ageing populations? (48 delegates)
January 25th 2010, King's College London, held before the Institute of Gerontology's Annual Lecture.
