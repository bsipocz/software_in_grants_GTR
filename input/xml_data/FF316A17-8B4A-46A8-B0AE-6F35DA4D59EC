inequalities has emerged as a health priority and attention is now turning to the factors which sustain cancer survival, including quality of life. New forms of care will be personalised to individual needs representing a cultural shift in the approach to care with a greater focus on recovery, health and well-being.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is away from a one size fits all approach to one which recognises people?s differing needs and preferences. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women are invisible in cancer services and their help-seeking behaviours are not widely understood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project builds on the Coming Out about Breast Cancer study which revealed distinctive experiences of treatment and care: heterosexism in cancer services, interactions with health professionals and accessing support. Working from a user involvement perspective, the project aims to exchange knowledge between cancer organisations and the LB women?s voluntary sector.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Specifically, the project will embed sexual orientation equality in organisational cultures and practices through a learning event and practice guidance; to influence health policy through government and relevant bodies and to develop wider knowledge economies about LB women?s health.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project links to the ESRC goals of promoting healthy ageing and delivering interventions to enhance physical and psychological well-being.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7904</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Social work's contribution to tackling health inequalities</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B646DB3-79A8-404A-9E73-294DFA6992D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contibuted to the Global Agenda for Social work

In today's podcast, Julie Fish talks to us about social work's role in addressing health inequalities and the social determinants of health, and the importance of raising the profession's profile in this area of practice.

 

Julie Fish is joint convener of the Social Work and Health Inequalities Network, an association of over 300 social work academics and practitioners from over 25 countries worldwide, who seek to combat the causes and consequences of unjust and damaging socially created health inequalities. She has conducted research in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans health and social care inequalities for 18 years. She has recently completed an ESRC Knowledge exchange project RES-192-22-0111 Developing professional knowledge about breast cancer undertaken in conjunction with Macmillan Cancer Support, Breast Cancer Care and LGBT social care NGOs. She has carried out work for the National Cancer Action team and the NHS Cervical Screening Programme. Prescription for Change, conducted with Stonewall, is the largest health and social care survey of lesbian and bisexual women in Europe. In 2012, her book Social work and lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people: Making a difference was published by The Policy Press. Her research interests include: Health and Human Rights, The Social Determinants of Health, Social Perspectives on Cancer and Public and Patient Involvement.

They are timely in light of the recognition of the human rights of LGBT people in 2012 when the United Nations first called on all states to prohibit discrimination and implement protections, including access to health care. The project advances scientific understandings about LGBT people's right to health and of sexual orientation and gender identity as social determinants of health. Public and patient involvement approaches: This project examines the meanings of personalised care for LGBT people with cancer. It demonstrates how professionals' knowledge, skills and values can enhance the quality of life and promote healthy ageing in LGBT communities. Epistemologies of user involvement are under-theorised in LGBT research; the project develops understanding of PPI as a methodological approach recognising that outcomes will better reflect the concerns of those affected by cancer if they have been engaged in the project's design and implementation. Enhancing teaching and learning: promoting social work's role in tackling health inequalities: As a discipline, social work plays a key role in reducing health inequalities; however, it is under-represented in the literature. This project has deepened my understanding of health inequalities and of social work's contribution which I have used to develop inter-disciplinary teaching and learning for students at undergraduate and doctoral levels.
Findings and Outputs
LGBT health inequalities: Presentations to academic conferences: European Social Work Conference (Oxford, March 2011); seminar to academics (Bradford, Oct 2011); Joint World Conference of Social Work and Social Development, (Stockholm, July 2012); Co-Chair, LGBT health symposium, Social Work in Health and Mental Health Conference (Los Angeles, June 2013). Book contract with The Policy Press: Social work and lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans health inequalities: International perspectives (25 contributors from 10 countries worldwide). Book chapter to be published in Sage. One paper currently under review in a health related journal. Public and patient involvement approaches: Launch of policy briefing at Breast Cancer Care, London (March 2011); Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) Good Practice days University of Leicester May 2011 and University of Northampton, June 2011. Seminar to Macmillan cancer professionals (Feb 2012). Enhancing teaching and learning: promoting social work's role in tackling health inequalities: Presentations to academic conferences: Joint World Conference of Social Work and Social Development, (2nd paper) (Stockholm, July 2012); Social Work in Health and Mental Health Conference (2nd paper) (Los Angeles, June 2013); One journal article in Social Work Education (Jan 2013); commissioned to write curriculum guide for The College of Social Work.
How these impacts were achieved
The project's scientific findings have been disseminated at a number of national and international conferences; a journal article has been published and a second article is under submission. Presentation at the World Social Work Conference in Stockholm enabled me to meet with the publisher who subsequently agreed an edited book contract on LGBT health inequalities. The presentation led directly to networking opportunities where I met 10 out of the 24 contributors to the book and enabled me to speak to the President of an international social work organisation who agreed to write the preface. Presenting the findings at these prestigious conferences illustrates the interest in and impact of the project. Presentations were made to two good practice days on the study's methodology of public and patient involvement (PPI); such approaches are under-theorised in LGBT research. The principle of making change happen was the focus of a conference for health professionals in the NHS where the DKP project was the plenary presentation. The project contributed to the goal of making health services equitable and to developing professionals' knowledge about making provision accessible. An indirect outcome of the project was a plenary presentation by Sir Michael Marmot to the Stockholm conference. This raised the profile of the parallel sessions on health inequalities and of my joint paper on social work's contribution.
Who these findings impact
The project has led to new international collaborations: at the Los Angeles conference a symposium consisting of seven academics will be held which I will co-chair on LGBT health inequalities. The book will bring together 24 LGBT researchers from 8 countries worldwide including Canada, the US, India and Sweden. Academics and researchers such as in cancer, medicine and public health, social work, social policy, sociology of health, psychology and nursing are interested in the ways in which health more widely, and cancer in particular, is mediated by sexual orientation and gender identity. Academics and researchers in health and social work will benefit from of PPI as a methodological innovation. Academics in the Social Work and Health inequalities gave very positive feedback about the curriculum materials.
Summary of economic impacts
This knowledge exchange project has impact across and within disciplines by advancing theoretical understanding and methodological approaches, specifically: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans (LGBT) health inequalities and human rights: The study contributes to re-conceptualisations of LGBT health from notions of pathology to that of an underserved population. They are timely in light of the recognition of the human rights of LGBT people in 2012 when the United Nations first called on all states to prohibit discrimination and implement protections, including access to health care. The project advances scientific understandings about LGBT people's right to health and of sexual orientation and gender identity as social determinants of health. Public and patient involvement approaches: This project examines the meanings of personalised care for LGBT people with cancer. It demonstrates how professionals' knowledge, skills and values can enhance the quality of life and promote healthy ageing in LGBT communities. Epistemologies of user involvement are under-theorised in LGBT research; the project develops understanding of PPI as a methodological approach recognising that outcomes will better reflect the concerns of those affected by cancer if they have been engaged in the project's design and implementation. Enhancing teaching and learning: promoting social work's role in tackling health inequalities: As a discipline, social work plays a key role in reducing health inequalities; however, it is under-represented in the literature. This project has deepened my understanding of health inequalities and of social work's contribution which I have used to develop inter-disciplinary teaching and learning for students at undergraduate and doctoral levels.

How these impacts were achieved
The project's scientific findings have been disseminated at a number of national and international conferences; a journal article has been published and a second article is under submission. Presentation at the World Social Work Conference in Stockholm enabled me to meet with the publisher who subsequently agreed an edited book contract on LGBT health inequalities. The presentation led directly to networking opportunities where I met 10 out of the 24 contributors to the book and enabled me to speak to the President of an international social work organisation who agreed to write the preface. Presenting the findings at these prestigious conferences illustrates the interest in and impact of the project. Presentations were made to two good practice days on the study's methodology of public and patient involvement (PPI); such approaches are under-theorised in LGBT research. The principle of making change happen was the focus of a conference for health professionals in the NHS where the DKP project was the plenary presentation. The project contributed to the goal of making health services equitable and to developing professionals' knowledge about making provision accessible. An indirect outcome of the project was a plenary presentation by Sir Michael Marmot to the Stockholm conference. This raised the profile of the parallel sessions on health inequalities and of my joint paper on social work's contribution.
Who these findings impact
The project has led to new international collaborations: at the Los Angeles conference a symposium consisting of seven academics will be held which I will co-chair on LGBT health inequalities. The book will bring together 24 LGBT researchers from 10 countries worldwide including Canada, the US, Australia, India, South Africa and Sweden. Academics and researchers such as in cancer, medicine and public health, social work, social policy, sociology of health, psychology and nursing are interested in the ways in which health more widely, and cancer in particular, is mediated by sexual orientation and gender identity. Academics and researchers in health and social work will benefit from of PPI as a methodological innovation. Academics in the Social Work and Health inequalities gave very positive feedback about the curriculum materials.
The project led to a subsequent study - Improving the cancer journey for LGB people funded by the cancer charity, Hope against Cancer.
Potential future impacts
The book with Policy Press will potentially contribute to scientific advances in understanding LGBT health inequalities as embodied health inequalities and to the development of a small network of researchers in this field. I am planning to seek joint funding to produce global curricula materials on social work's role in tackling health inequalities. Further academic publications arising from this project are planned.
Unexpected impacts
The invitation to Professor Sir Michael Marmot to address 2,000 delegates at the Joint world social work conference in Stockholm in July 2012 raised awareness of social work's contribution to reducing health inequalities and gave impetus to the Social Work and Health Inequalities Network for future work.

Key learning points from the seminar evaluation include:



Understanding of distinctive needs of LGBT cancer service users

? Awareness of isolation for LGBT

? That LGBT patients have the same needs as all Cancer patients and asking sensitive questions will enhance care

? Equality and inclusion for partners when terminally ill. Being aware of family and cultures) and overlapping partners at time of death

? The need for services to be more aware of LGBT issues when delivering care

? Listen to what partners/ carers want and need

? Examples given by service users of good and poor practice - makes it easy to translate the experiences for the unaware in terms of the impact.



 Attitudes and assumptions of cancer professionals

? Getting it wrong is OK as long as we acknowledge our limitations and accept responsibility for mistakes and apologise

? Be mindful of how you address people

? Do not make assumptions

? Stating neutrality at start of consultation and not making assumptions - giving permission

? Do not assume, everyone is different and don't assume they want to come out! 

? Continue to be non judgemental and inclusive as a clinician

? Any queries try and ask rather than avoid

? Learning about various methods/ ways of improving your ability when dealing with LGBT people



Access to information and support

? Great awareness of support voluntary services

? Look for collaboration with local LGBT groups to provide support for this group

? Need for more information about needs and experiences of LGBT people 

? There are resources though limited available through Macmillan

? Planning LGBT specific support groups

? Learning about so many services being provided by Macmillan and other orgs.

? Publications and inclusive information

? Keep trying to identify funding to set up an LGBT cancer support network!

? There's lots of support and resource out there to help us to take this forward

? Dissemination widely our sexual orientation monitoring info to the delegate list



Developing the wider team

? Feedback to immediate team evidence/ ideas/ suggestions

? Identify as a team priorities for action

? Implement and evaluate

? Needing to get buy in from others

? Thank you it has been a very informative thought provoking day - now need to translate thoughts into action.

? Educating my team on the importance of this issue as clearly the LGBT voice has not fully penetrated the mainstream

? Offer LGBT training to breast care staff 

? The need to think about action plans for taking this forward

? Empower staff to feel more confident and to ensure services and materials are inclusive and tailored



_</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Breast Cancer Care used the policy briefing in cancer inequalities campaigns work and it was widely disseminated by them to Breast Care Specialist nurses in England and Wales, the NHS, and cancer charities. Staff at BCC developed web-pages about the project on their website. Other outcomes for BCC include:



? Disseminated the briefing widely and used in policy/ campaigns work around inequalities in breast cancer;



? Equality and Diversity Strategy: User audits of BCC services, more inclusive imagery and language, working with other organisations, case studies, develop training on understanding the impact of discrimination on health and confidence to access services and increase the diversity of Our Voices;

? BCC collect sexual orientation data for volunteers and plan to do so for everyone that uses BCC's services;

? Identify patterns of service usage and examine whether differences can be attributed to equalities issues;

? Using recommendations in BCC's policy work.

A key learning event was delivered in February 2012 in collaboration with Macmillan for 40 cancer and social care professionals to enable staff to feel more confident in delivering care for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) people with cancer. 

Supporting LGBT people with cancer is a resource which was subsequently developed with the involvement of service users and professionals. Macmillan has been key to disseminating the practice guidance to 4,000 Macmillan cancer professionals; it is available through their Learn Zone site; as an information resource for events; and at Macmillan's national professionals' conference event in November 2012.

Given as a health system we are serious about our mission to address inequalities, one group that must demand our attention is the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans community. 

The LGB&amp;amp;T Companion to the Public Health Outcomes Framework sets the evidence base related to each public health indicator, and makes clear recommendations for action at local, regional and national levels. I have tasked the Health and Wellbeing Directorate of Public Health England, with its responsibility to lead on health inequalities, to seek ways to support the implementation of these recommendations.
