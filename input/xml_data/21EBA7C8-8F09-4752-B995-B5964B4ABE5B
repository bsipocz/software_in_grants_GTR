It aims to explore the relationship between Anglican renewal (Oxford Movement and Tractarianism), British national identity, and the formation of British colonial society through a detailed examination of religious architecture and its transportation across the globe. The study focuses on the intellectual origins and motives underpinning the transformation that occurred in ecclesiastical design during this period, reassessing the ways in which High Victorian theory affected attitudes towards the role of Anglicanism and its ecclesiological manifestations in the non-European world. The study is interdisciplinary and considers these ideas in the context of contemporary debates on missionary theology, scientific theory, sexuality, race, national identity, and the political economy of art.\n \nThe period under examination is considered especially important in the history of religious architecture in Britain, coinciding with the rise of the university architectural societies - the Cambridge Camden (later Ecclesiological) Society and the Oxford Architectural Society. These societies were concerned with developing a scholarly approach towards church design and restoration. They regularly commented on and assisted church design in Britain's colonies and were responsible for making the Gothic Revival style the lingua franca of church architecture throughout the British empire. The Ecclesiological Society in particular rose up to become the most influential forum for the discussion of church architecture in Britain during this period. Its principal publication, 'The Ecclesiologist' (1841-68), quickly became a popular and important periodical, affecting the work of some of Britain's foremost architects, including William Burges, G. E. Street, George Gilbert Scott, G. F. Bodley, and William Butterfield. One of the functions of 'The Ecclesiologist' was to report on church architecture in Britain's colonies. As these areas were seen as frontier environments - places of emigration, opportunity, social experimentation and confrontation - the perceived need to encourage correct church design was considered part of the wider Victorian 'mission' to promulgate western values through Christian teaching and worship. Architecture was seen as a chief agent in the success of this mission.\n\nAlthough devoted to the study of architecture per se, the study is predicated on the notion that buildings are culturally-mediated artefacts that embody and represent ideas. It is believed that a close study of religious architecture (size, design, context, materials) has the potential to reveal much about the motives, organisation, and effectiveness of the Anglican mission and the role it played in the process of colonisation. It is hoped that a fuller understanding of the considerable intellectual and pecuniary resources that went into formalising the religious practices of the Anglican Church through architecture will allow for a richer and more diverse interpretation of British imperial and colonial history. Some scholarship has been carried out on this subject but the phenomenon as a whole awaits systematic study on a global scale. Only a global perspective such as that intended here can give a full and coherent account of the role played by architecture in the Anglican mission field. The study will not only demonstrate the sheer variety of buildings erected - from grass chapels to stone cathedrals - but also their consistency (see Visual Evidence 1 &amp;amp; 2). \n\nWith this in mind, the study intends to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the Anglican church abroad, taking scholarship on Victorian architecture in a new and exciting direction by engaging fields of inquiry as diverse as intellectual history, social anthropology, cultural geography, and aspects of post-colonial theory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries of the research include a number of government, non-government (i.e., charity), and amenity agencies and societies both in Britain and abroad.\n\nGovernment agencies that will benefit directly from the research include heritage conservation and building listing organisations. An example of such an impact is the South African Heritage Resources Agency which has already asked me to supply them with information about an historic church in Grahamstown. It is hoped that this information will lead to the building's listing and future conservation. My book, when complete, will contain many dozens of such examples, providing new information that will lead to the long-term preservation of the buildings discussed (a number of which are already considered national monuments).\n\nNon-governmental agencies include charities such as National Trust and development organisations in various countries. An example of this is my involvement in a project to restore the fabric of Christ Church cathedral, Zanzibar. This has resulted directly from my research on this building (which is included in the book) and is headed up by a UK-based charity Christian Engineers in Development.\n\nAmenity societies and amateur organisations include the Victorian Society, the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain, and the Society of Architectural Historians (USA). These organisations are registered charities that work to promote an interest in the historic built environment among the general public. The Victorian Society, the world's largest and most active organisation for the protection of Victorian heritage, has asked me to organise a one-day conference on the development of ecclesiastical architecture in Britain's empire during the nineteenth century. This conference is to be held in November 2010, bring specialist speakers from around the world, and is a public event. Information about this event reaches the several-thousand strong membership of the Society through their quarterly publications. As my work on this topic has also been published in the journals of the SAHGB and SAH, it reaches a wide and interested general readership. Membership of these societies is made up predominantly of members of the general public.\n\nI have also been involved in the organisation of exhibitions. One such was the travelling exhibition 'Two Cathedrals, Two \nCountries: Grahamstown, South Africa and Toronto, Canada.' I supplied specialist architectural knowledge for the preparation of this exhibition, which opened in Toronto in 2005 and travelled to Grahamstown in 2007. \n\nA number of copies of my journal articles on the topic of Anglican church architecture have already been sent to public libraries and archives in Africa. All the national libraries and archives in which I worked while conducting research for the book have asked to be notified when the book is published.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>63675</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This study has been used by those working on the history and heritage of British imperial/colonial church buildings throughout the world.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>75B5FF74-24B1-4506-BA6F-38A45479F09A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>543fcf6502bc58.96961467</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) that a much more extensive network of clerical and architectural associations existed between Britain and its colonies in the transfer of knowledge and experience than previously understood

3) that religion, especially Anglicanism, played a greater role than previously understood in this transformative process, and that religion in general was a crucial factor in the cultural 'mission' of empire

4) that theoretical discourse regarding foreign and colonial architecture affected thinking in the 'metropolis' on concepts concerning 'development' far more than previously supposed
