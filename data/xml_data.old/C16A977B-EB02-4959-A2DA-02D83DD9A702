The workshop was entitled, Insights into Animal Production Science: from stem cells and systems biology to pig production. The event was supported by funding from the BBSRC China Partnering Award, Huazhong Agricultural University, along with British Council Sino-UK partnership award, which enabled the attendance of range of academic staff and PhD students with a range of expertise. The event consisted of 2 days of seminars describing research carried out at University of Nottingham and covered areas related to pig production which included pig nutrition and production systems, molecular biology of the systems regulating pig growth, factors influencing pig reproduction as well as information on the application bioinformatics and systems biology to pig production research. Presentations were given by academics, post-doctoral researchers and PhD students from University of Nottingham, Huazhong Agricultural University, Shandong Agriculture Universty, South China Agricultural University and Nanjing Agricultural University.
In addition there were 3 days of lab based workshops covering the practical aspects of the research described in the seminars. These workshops were given by University of Nottingham academic staff and PhD students and were set up and administered by a member of the University of Nottingham technical staff whose attendance at the workshop enabled this laboratory based component to work.
Alongside this scientific outcome various team building events allowed participants to develop a good understanding of the cultural and societal aspects that underpin the practice of science in China. 
In addition the academics from the University of Nottingham had a series of meetings with senior administrators in Huazhong Agricultural University exploring the establishment of an MOU, or key laboratory status, between the two universities. This would enable access to China Scholarship Council funding. The objective would be establish a programme which allowed Chinese students to intercalate a UK based 1 year MRes into their China based MSc (3 years).

Sharing of research methods and findings between researchers from the UK and China.

As part of the meeting funding for to support the PhD studentship for Haixin Zhang was secured from Zoetis (&amp;pound;30,000) which would be additional to the funding for this PhD position from the University of Nottingham and China scholarship Council and funding (Oct 2012 - Sept 2016). The Objective of this studentship project was to isolation and generation of STEM cells from germ cells isolated from pigs (supervised by Dr Ramiro Alberio (PI), Drs Brameld and Parr (Co-Is).
A commitment from Zoetis was obtained to support a BBSRC LINK application submission for research work to the current extend the BBSRC-LINK project; Pig Feed Efficiency: A systems integrative biology, BB/J005320/1 (Sept 2012-2013). This originally was to include a collaborative input from Huazhong Agricultural University through funding from the China Scholarship Council. However subsequent to this meeting a change Zoetis corporate research funding strategy met that they no longer wished to support collaborative projects between China and Western universities. However Zoetis did still support a BBSRC LINK proposal which was successfully funded in June 2014, BB/M001385/1: Novel targets for increased muscle growth or feed efficiency.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544e4d4da63701.59107037</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>803630</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC-LINK project</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/M001385/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B0AD82B0-117C-4AB4-9298-46DD9EE6A8D3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e82f809b796.51992383</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>32800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>British Council Sino-UK Higher Education Partnership for PhD Studies award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>967BD29C-A877-477D-9126-B7330CA6C41F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e5ee19ba7e5.25447871</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>592000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC response mode</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/M001466/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>9F5E6098-7278-4755-BC5B-38CE3C53DC18</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e836c5f72c6.01167510</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This BBSRC China partnering award allowed us to establish a collaboration with the Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan China.
Through a series of meetings either at the University of Nottingham or Huazhong Agricultural University we were able to provide an opportunity to discuss research findings and appropriate analytical techniques. An added impact of these meetings was that collectively the two academic institutions were able to engage with the global animal health pharmaceutical company Zoetis. This has enabled to access funding from Zoetis to support a PhD studentship as well as secure additional funding to support a BBSRC-LINK project BB/M001385/1. This research is directly involved in the economic impact of determining how to improve the efficiency of pig growth
The China Partnering award has allowed exchange of academics. This has included an extended period of training for Dr Xinyun Li from Huazhong Agricultural University in techniques associated with pig stem cell technologies which he will be able to disseminate to colleagues at his home institution.
The exchanges have enable engagement of a range of UK scientists with numerous academics, early career researchers as well as post-graduate research students from China. This was particularly the case in the Workshop; Insights into Animal Production: from Stem Cells and Systems Biology to Pig Production (July 2014). The meeting endeavored to share our current research findings and share best research practice in the area of pig production science. Alongside this scientific outcome various team building events allowed participants to develop a good understanding of the cultural and societal aspects that underpin the practice of science in China.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>14D019F2-F875-4FDF-89D1-83B81198625E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544e6b3c9832a1.99354275</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The tragic early death of Professor Keith Campbell in October 2012 meant major adjustments in the China Partnering awards had to be made as Professor Campbell was to be directly involved in the collaborative research associated with his specialist area of nuclear transfer technology (objective 2). However through adjustment of the programme we believe we were able to meet the objectives set out in the original application. 
The most significant outcomes of the BBSRC China Partnering Award was exchanges have enable engagement of a range of UK scientists with numerous academics, early career researchers as well as post-graduate research students from China. Our meetings endeavored to share our current research findings and share best research practice in the area of pig production science for mutual benefit (Objective 1). This has resulted in a joint manuscript being submitted for publication. Alongside this scientific outcome various team building events allowed participants to develop a good understanding of the cultural and societal aspects that underpin the practice of science in China. 
The extended study exchange that was undertaken as part of the Partnering Award enabled an academic from our partner institution in China to begin to develop a novel cell culture based technique to potentially generate muscle cells from general non-specialized cell types (fibroblasts) isolated from any pig (Objective 2). This will allow the generation pig specific muscle cells in culture (currently difficult to do) which can be continuously grown. More importantly it will allow the investigation of biological mechanisms regulating muscle function in cells rather than in having to kill animals for each experiment. Such a research resource will enable the investigation of variation in response due to different pig breed. This has significant value to pig production systems in China where multiple pig breeds are used commercially. As a result of a PhD studentship, which was generated and funded as a result of our collaborations generated by the Partnering Award, we have produced preliminary data which has, in part, been responsible for a colleague, who was part of the Partnering Award, gaining funding to investigate application of these type of technologies to generate and culture the cells responsible for reproductive capacity in pigs (BBSRC grant BB/M001466/1). 
Therefore we have been able identify opportunities in the area of pig production which might be applicable to generate animals with enhanced efficiency of nutrient utilization (objective 3). In need, partially through the collaborative discussion and work instigated through the China Partnering Award we have been able to attract further funding form the global animal health pharmaceutical company Zoetis, for example our BBSRC LINK grant BB/M001385/1. Although collaborative outputs from the China Partnering Award have attracted funding from Zoetis, this company has chosen to explore these opportunities by funding the groups at the University of Nottingham and Huazhong Agricultural University independently of each other. However both sites are using this funding to establish novel ways of improving feed efficiency in pigs which will hopefully have an impact on maintaining global food security.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our collaborative work as part of this China Partnering award as allowed the development of ideas and techniques in the area of pig production which are currently being utilized by global animal health pharmaceutical company Zoetis to identify processes that could be manipulated to enhance the efficiency of pig production.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F3A6C71E-6728-433A-9F87-EDC8C30D9A35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e715d263916.21261462</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F2894C2C-44A2-472D-AE0F-106F6DAA9908</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transcriptome analysis of mRNA and miRNA in skeletal muscle indicates an important network for differential Residual Feed Intake in pigs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57bd7dfe4fbbce3120e1e29e47d981ff"><gtr:id>57bd7dfe4fbbce3120e1e29e47d981ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jing L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>55f2f64fcd9da5.21240046</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F894226D-A4C7-411B-96D3-9DF612267F2B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Teaching Data Science and Cloud Computing in Low and Middle Income Countries</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advanced Techniques in Biology &amp; Medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f6ad3d6ee5e33ef944c6b6c85fa17fd2"><gtr:id>f6ad3d6ee5e33ef944c6b6c85fa17fd2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shanahan H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dfe700bcaf56.44497727</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FDF62F29-7295-494E-9357-F2F15D61A3FD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Improving efficiency in meat production.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8c5147649a43156f22bb0fb7e578f1a"><gtr:id>b8c5147649a43156f22bb0fb7e578f1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brameld JM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0029-6651</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b7f078c194a0.39232185</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>848A90AA-4503-4DA7-A786-B109B7159BBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of growth promoters on muscle growth and the potential consequences for meat quality.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Meat science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f65d7c593120875adeef426ae6559515"><gtr:id>f65d7c593120875adeef426ae6559515</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parr T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0309-1740</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b7f10f42f2b6.57149574</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J019984/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
