In contexts where genes are not switched on correctly, or where genes are not on for the correct period of time, loss of cell function results, which can lead to devastating human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration and developmental disorders.
 To study how the switching on and off of genes is controlled, we use a state-of-the-art technique, to directly watch single genes in living cells. Using a microscope, we can observe cells and assess whether a specific gene is on or off. We measure the number and duration of on and off periods and the variation in the strength of the on phase over time. We test how the on/off properties alter when cells are stimulated, and how they change over time as the cells develop.
We compare these observations to simple computer simulations of gene behaviour, which are developed using rules we decide upon. When the computer fails to mimic the on/off behaviour of real genes, we learn that our rules are wrong, and need to be changed. When we have a set of rules which appears to work, we then make modifications to the actual genes, then watch and record how their behaviour changes. The rules we have developed should also apply in a predictable way to the modified gene, so if they do not, we know the rules are still wrong, and we need to further evaluate them. The process of adjusting and improving the set of rules forces us to continually develop a more complete understanding of how genes are controlled</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Controlled gene expression is crucial to generate and maintain structure and function in biology. Loss of control in gene expression decisions leads to developmental abnormalities and is integral to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, amongst other disease states. To understand these fundamental problems of gene expression requires advanced technologies to detect and measure transcription from individual genes in real time. We have therefore pioneered a technology to visualise the transcriptional behaviour of single genes in individual living cells. We demonstrated that transcription is stochastic, characterised by irregular pulses of gene activity. Pulsing transcription is conserved from bacteria to humans, and may generate gene expression diversity, which drives cell differentiation in development and disease. Pulsing has major implications for our understanding of transcriptional mechanism, yet the mechanisms underlying gene pulsing are not known.
 To characterise the mechanism of transcriptional pulsing, we will combine live imaging of single gene transcriptional behaviour with computational modelling and molecular genetics. We will measure fluctuations in spot intensity during transcriptional pulsing using custom built automated image analysis software for spot tracking. Data will be compared to simulations and modelling to identify the major control steps in transcription. Predictions from simulations will be tested against modified versions of the experimental set-up, where gene length and structure have been altered. Predictions will be further tested using independent measures of single cell gene expression. We will use mutations in known and predicted regulators of pulsing to superimpose molecular players onto the dynamic mechanistic framework. Finally, we will define the roles of pulsing on system behaviour.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal (and the lab in general) is very much within with three BBSRC priority areas within &amp;quot;exploiting new ways of working&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Data driven biology&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Systems approaches to the biosciences&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Technology development for the biosciences&amp;quot;. We're also very much within the 3Rs category. As we are working on phenomena conserved between bacteria and mammalian cells, the use of relatively simple model organisms is appropriate.

Direct
The immediate impact will be on biologists who work on gene expression, who seek to understand how transcription woks and is regulated. Similarly, researchers in the single cell gene expression field want to understand how transcriptional mechanism can generate or transmit stochasticity in gene expression. Developmental and stem cell biologists learn much about how cells make decisions when they can see these gene expression decisions occurring in real time. This is &amp;quot;blue sky&amp;quot; fundamental research whose impact is difficult to quantify directly. However, the work underpins and refreshes much of the basic research occurring in molecular, cell and developmental biology, so in the medium to long term (5 years and beyond) the impact is potentially very high. 

Training
Additional beneficiaries will be the modern biosciences in general. Our approaches are multidisciplinary, going beyond traditional molecular cell biology. Post-docs come through the lab and have to learn a variety of skills from basic cell and molecular methods, but also computer programming, modelling, handling and analysis of large imaging data sets, skills that greatly enhance the intellectual and practical climate of labs, departments and scientific fields, and also find great utility beyond science. They also get repeated experience writing papers and grants and presenting the work at international meetings. In multidisciplinary science collaborative work is essential, unlike traditional molecular biology, where one person could do everything. This more selfless approach will pay dividends for an individual outside academia. 

Education
In addition, I lecture on this field to biology undergraduates, which channels this work into an excellent introduction to strengths of interdisciplinary research in the life sciences. Postgraduates from three different programmes (Molecular Cell Biology, CoMPLEX and the BBSRC Interdisciplinary sciences programmes) also benefit from the potential to rotate through the lab on specific projects, in addition to MRes and other tutorial seminars associated with these programmes, greatly increasing exposure. 

Potential exploitation
At this point in time, the image analysis, which is undergoing a very vibrant phase in its evolution, is well beyond the state-of-the-art for what is commercially available. The level of automation we have brought to identifying faint objects within highly dynamic cells is well beyond what the commercial generic image analysis software can achieve. High content screening image analysis software used for drug and RNAi screens also lacks these dynamic and sensitivity capabilities, and we will liase with the UCL Translational Research Office about the possibility of developing these tools commercially.

Outreach
Our work is, and will continue to be, very visual, and is very straightforward to communicate to science classes of 14 years and up. The major strength of what we do is that it gives the children the impression what they are learning at school is not some abstract game, but has meaning after they leave secondary and tertiary education. After 5 years giving school talks using the Royal Society of Edinburgh Schools programme, I will continue to contribute to UCL's own schools work. Where appropriate, I have promoted our work more broadly, with previous coverage in regional newspapers and radio stations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>379591</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Collaboration with Artists at St Martin's College</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>027CA57C-893D-4E90-9D55-0E9BF5853C9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My research was the basis of a 2 week project to contribute to a Masters programme at St Martin's College entitled &amp;quot;Big Data&amp;quot;.

Standard approaches to measure the activity of genes monitor the average gene output from millions of cells, at a fixed point in time. These methods give the impression that transcription is a continuous, smooth process. When the transcriptional output of individual genes is monitored in individual cells by in situ hybrididation, a surprising amount of variability in transcriptional output is observed between cells in cell populations, which challenges the simple view of a continuous process. The standard model to explain this variability - the &amp;quot;two state&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bursting&amp;quot; model- proposes that genes switch between &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; states with a certain probability, meaning that at any one time, a gene will be off in many cells, and on in others. The variability in transcriptional outputs explained by the relative amount of time the gene spends in either state in individual cells. 

In situ hybridisation methods are highly useful, however, they are carried out on dead cells, so the dynamic process of switching between &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; states is inferred, rather than observed. It is now possible to image the switching process in living cells, allowing the dynamics of transcriptional changes to be directly observed

To obtain greater insight into the mechanisms underlying transcriptional fluctuations, we directly imaged the transcription of an actin gene in individual living cells. Combined with molecular genetics and computational modelling, this imaging approach revealed that transcriptional bursting is better descibed by a continuum or spectrum of activity, rather than discrete &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; states. Underlying these fluctuations in activity over the spectrum of activity states is the transcription initiation rate, which changes over a timescale of several minutes. In contrast, the polymerase elongation rate is likely to change over a much shorter timescale. Finally, we show that the conserved regulatory element of the promoter, the TATA box, is required for the gene to reach the highest levels of the spectrum of activity. A spectrum of activity states may allow more fine-tuned control of cell responses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>How do different genes compare? The actin gene has a very simple promoter. Do more complex promoters generate more complex patterns of activity? What explains the timescale of initiation rate variation?
