A fundamental business question for OQC is what applications (quantum algorithms) are best suited for their technology, and how to most efficiently realise first generation processors that will be capable of running these applications, and hence generate sales. This project addresses this challenge from two angles; development by Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited (CQC) of a quantum compiler dedicated to the OQC hardware architecture, and prototype development and assessment of circuit layouts with differing connectivity maps. These two directions will be combined with assessment of mapping of quantum algorithms onto the OQC architecture to produce clear direction for OQC R&amp;amp;D in the next phase of its development.

Quantum algorithms are typically given in a high level mathematical language, and are not designed with particular hardware architectures in mind. This makes it challenging for OQC and its customers to realise the full potential of the technology. This project seeks to address this problem by demonstrating software that efficiently compiles quantum algorithms onto the
OQC architecture. The software module will act as an interface between users and the hardware; enabling the technology to run quantum programs. Using IP developed by CQC will facilitate getting the most out of the available hardware.

Understanding how quantum programs are mapped to the architecture will also inform the design decisions for the next generation device built by OQC. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of these decisions by prototyping the key concept in hardware. The new software plus prototyped hardware will demonstrate a step change in the capabilities of the next generation quantum computer built by OQC.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will have significant impact on the development of Quantum Technology in the UK. It will be the first example of a partnership between two UK start-ups dedicated to Quantum Computing, and will significantly elevate the UK's visibility and credibility in the area, at a time when the sector is growing at a rapid pace. This will lead on to a wide impact in the form of job creation and safeguarding as the Quantum Technology sector becomes more robust and is made more secure in the UK.

The identification and preliminary demonstrations of target applications for the quantum circuit architecture will have impact on potential customers, who will see a clear path to their use of quantum computers. These customers are likely to be in materials and drug design and simulation. The impact on wider society of such customers in turn being able to more efficiently design and produce new better materials and drugs cannot be underestimated.

Quantum Computing is at the cutting edge of Quantum Technology research and is a strongly growing and exciting area for young people in higher education and early stage research careers. This project will strengthen Quantum Computing education in the UK, by closely tying together spin-out activities from two of the country's most prominent universities. Quantum computing will enhance society's ability to deliver AI and related computational resource to a broader and bigger portion of society. This project itself will enhance the ability of projects in Oxford and in Cambridge to continue to hire and attract young talent and enhance the employment profile of STEM graduates. The project will also accelerate the growth of CQC and OQC, increasing the chances of employment by these companies of UK Quantum Technology educated graduates in the coming years.

This project sits right at the heart of the government's Quantum Technologies Hub initiative, and will demonstrate very directly the impact that this initiative is having on developing a Quantum Technology sector in the UK, and will enhance the global profile as well as the diversity of the different critical projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146579</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R044538/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
