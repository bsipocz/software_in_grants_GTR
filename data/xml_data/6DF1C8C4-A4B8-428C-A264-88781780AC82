A nucleic acid-based hereditary unit, the gene, carries this information and the characteristics of an organism are defined by its set of genes. Over the last century a number of exceptions to Mendel's Laws have been identified, but a new challenge to the dogma that all inheritance is nucleic acid based has recently arisen from the discovery of prions. Although prions have been intensively studied as the disease-causing agents associated with 'Mad Cow Disease' and the human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), there is now a considerable body of scientific evidence that prions might actually represent an entirely new form of heredity, based on a protein molecule rather than a nucleic acid. This evidence comes from the analysis of novel prion-based 'genetic' determinants in Baker's Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one of which (the so-called [PSI+] element) is being studied in this project. Our aim is to fully understand how such a protein-based determinant is generated de novo and then replicated aand passed on to other yeast cells when they grow and divide. We know that this requires cells to produce prion seeds which can be passed on to other cells and it is our objective to define the molecular composition of these seeds. Uisng advanced genetic and biochemical methods we will study different yeast prions and look in particular at the type of physical changes they go through in taking up their prion form. One outcome of this research might be identifying steps in the prion cycle that can be targetted by new drugs to block the formation of prion seeds.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three established prions: Sup35p/[PSI+], Ure2p/[URE3+] and Rnq1p/[PIN+]. Two models have been used to explain the self-propagation of prions in both yeast and mammals, the template-directed refolding model and the 'seeded polymerisation'. The latter model has gained general acceptance and invokes the formation of oligomeric seed that drives the polymerisation of soluble molecules of the prion protein thus forming the characteristic high molecular weight amyloid fibrils. Stable propagation of a yeast prion also requires the generation of such new prion seeds (which we refer to as 'propagons') which must be efficiently distributed during cell division and meiosis. However, what constitutes a yeast propagon at the molecular level and how its structure relates to the high molecular weight prion aggregates found in [PSI+] cells remains to be established. In vitro prion conversion assays have identified several different oligomeric forms of Sup35p and we have obtained preliminary data for the existence of several different prion oligomers in the cell. The overall aim of this project is to identify and characterise biochemically the prion protein oligomer(s) that are important for the de novo formation and propagation of the [PSI+] and [PIN+] prions of yeast. We will develop methods for the fractionation and analysis of oligomeric intermediates of both the Sup35p and Rnq1p and then use both an in vivo and an in vitro assay to identify those oligomers that are important for seeding polymerisation of the soluble forms of the protein i.e. define the propagons. Once we have identified these oligomer(s) they will be fully characterised both in terms of their morphology and biochemical composition. Finally, we will establish the nature of the functional interplay between Sup35p, Rnq1p and Hsp104, a molecular chaperone that is essential for prion propagation, during de novo conversion to [PSI+].</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313421</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Involvement in the Authentic Biology Project</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8AEDF684-76D3-4180-A750-D3C74557D37C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Throughout the period of this grant co-Is Tuite, von der Haar and postdoctoral researcher supported by this grant were involved with Authentic Biology, a Wellcome Trust-funded outreach project led by the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury. This involved 2-3 days per person per year visiting the School and participating in activities such as laboratory classes. This ongoing novel project involves years 12 and 13 school students carrying out research into multiple sclerosis by expressing myelin basic protein in yeast and characterising the purified protein (see www.mbp-squared.org). In 2012 the project was rolled out nationally, again with Wellcome Trust support and badged as the 'Authentic Biology' project that now engages some 1000 year 12 and 13 students a year in a variety of research projects across the UK (see www.authenticbiology.org). Naeimi acted as a technical aid and teacher, demonstrating techniques at workshops and providing project support.

The Authentic Biology has a national profile, has generated in excess of &amp;pound;500,000 funding from the Wellcome Trust and the project has and continues to receive wide coverage over the last three years from the local and national press, the scientific press (e.g. a Nature podcast; www.nature.com/nature/podcast/index-2013-11-21.html) and TV and radio interviews. This project has had a significant impact on the Langton School resulting in a doubling of the number of years 12/13 studying biology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462143ad6c931.43565303</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.authenticbiology.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2008,2009,2010,2011,2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UCAS Talks</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6293557F-5E47-425C-BC44-CE7FC730F299</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tuite presents 2-3 talks per year to parents and year 13 students on Prions: infectious agents or a new kind of protein

A nucleic acid (normally DNA)-based hereditary unit, the gene, carries this information and the characteristics of an organism are defined by its set of genes. However, over the last 20 years we have seen a challenge to the dogma that all inheritance is DNA or RNA based; this has emerged from the discovery of prions. Although originally studied as novel disease-causing agents associated with 'Mad Cow Disease' and the human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), there is now a considerable body of scientific evidence that prions might actually represent an entirely new form of heredity, based on a protein molecule rather than a nucleic acid. Prions are formed when a protein in a cell takes up a new three dimensional structure that then drives (i.e. 'seeds') further misfolding of other molecules of the same protein. The key supporting evidence for this novel form of epigenetic inheritance comes from the analysis of novel prion-based 'genetic' determinants in Baker's Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one of which (the so-called [PSI+] element) was the subject of our project. 

The overall aim of our project was to better understand how a protein-based infectious element is generated spontaneously in a cell i.e. de novo, since this would provide us with new insights into what triggers the underlying molecular event that leads to the key protein misfolding event. To address this we took several different approaches and amongst our main findings were:
1. The [PSI+] prion arises de novo in a yeast cell without any underlying and heritable change in this organisms' genome. This included an analysis of any changes either within the gene encoding Sup35p, the protein that gives rise to the [PSI+] prion, or other genes that might impact on prion formation.
2. Chemical agents that are known to trigger protein misfolding were shown not to stimulate de novo prion formation arguing that the trigger for prion formation is not a spontaneous protein misfolding event.
3. We were able to clarify the physical nature of yeast prions in vivo by undertaking a series of biochemical experiments to describe the relationship between the size of prion particles in cell lysates and properties of prions such as infectivity and seeding. The approach was complementary to the genetic approach we took as part of work funded by BBSRC grant E18382, where we developed a novel method to count the numbers of prion particles (propagons) in yeast cells. Our most significant finding was that prions exist in vivo as very large complexes comprised of smaller SDS-resistant sub-particles and that the large particles appear to harbour the activity of the prion.
4. We identified a physical interaction between the Sup35p and a second prion-forming protein known as Rnq1, the prion form of which (called [PIN+]) is required for de novo prion formation in yeast.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have allowed us to better understand the key stages of the prion's 'life cycle' and in particular the process by which they form and are then transferred to other cells. This information will now allow us to identify steps or molecules that may be targetted by drugs that might block the formation of new infectious prion seeds. This also has implications for other 'protein misfolding' disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6163DD03-DB6B-4E47-8F3E-9A482D05BB35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545780de9a9c55.25274495</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical
