This project seeks to test the hypothesis that such exile proved to be not only a form of punishment, but also, and more importantly, a form of cultural encounter. Clerics in exile spread their ideas at places where they had previously been unknown. They also absorbed influences from their new environment and, in the case of recall from exile, transferred ideas and experiences elsewhere. This process, the project contends, had a profound impact on the development of Christianity and its foundational texts in this period, which are still noticeable today. For example, the Nicene creed, which most of modern Christian denominations subscribe to, may not have had the same impact without the banishment of its original supporters during the fourth century.
In order to prove its hypothesis, the project adopts an interdisciplinary approach with an innovative methodology. It is a collaboration between Dr Julia Hillner (Sheffield, PI), a legal historian, and two international co-investigators, Prof J&amp;ouml;rg Ulrich (Halle), a theologian, and Associate Prof Jakob Engberg (Aarhus), a cultural historian. While both the development of Christian theology and ritual in this period and the legal development of the Roman penalty of exile have been extensively studied, the two have not been brought together before. The project seeks to rectify this gap in scholarship by re-invigorating traditional legal and theological studies that have typically concentrated on normative sources through the application of a digital approach that will help to set these sources in context. To this end, the project includes the construction of a relational database that collects all available information on individual clerical exiles. The data will be derived from printed and online source editions and we anticipate a dtaset comprising records for approximately 1,000 individuals. This will allow the project team to trace and visualise the personal and geographical networks clerical exiles developed and maintained from their place of banishment and after return from exile. The quantitative information will provide the basis for a thorough qualitative re-assessment of selected legal, theological and hagiographical texts of the period (also available in edited form), which will be investigated in the light of the networks of their authors and audiences. This part of the project will seek to establish the influence of exile experiences on the formation of Christian law, Christian doctrine and Christian cult in late antiquity. In short, the project involves a long-term study of exile that focuses on social networks of individual clerics and interprets institutional texts and structures not according to a top-down model of change, but as a result of relations among individuals, facilitated by exile, within a decentralised framework, in which every element of the network contributed to shape institutional developments.
The results of the project will be disseminated via a book co-authored by the PI, the Co-Is and the research associate of the project, and via a doctoral dissertation. The project will also maintain a project blog and website, which will ensure access to the database for a larger academic audience, and, embedded in educational material, for a broader non-academic audience, and will hold a final international conference. The project will also develop a network of local museums and heritage organisations at places of late antique banishment with a view to develop closer collaboration for future funding applications.
The project will commence in May 2014 and is scheduled to run for 36 months.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Exile, as understood by this project, did not separate, but, on the contrary, connected individuals and communities over space and cultures, creating new networks that had the power to change politics, law and belief. The results of the project's research are therefore of interest to all organisations and individuals seeking to understand both the positive and negative consequences of legally forced migration and mobility, be this in the historically specific context of late antiquity, or in contemporary society, where this context can serve as comparandum or inspiration. More precisely, beneficiaries of the project's research result beyond academic beneficiaries may include: 

- Museum curators, heritage professionals and tourism agencies connected to the locations of banishment who may want to present their collections or sites from the perspective of how exile influenced the locality and connected it to other communities. These include UK based museums, such as the British Museum and the Museum of the Isles of Scilly (a frequent place of banishment in late antiquity), but also museums in Europe, in particular around the Mediterranean.
- Individuals or schools, both nationally and internationally, who would like to learn more about the role of their own localities in the Mediterranean and northern European network created by late antique exile.
- Policy makers at UK or Europe based think tanks, who are interested in understanding how the legal transfer of religious dissidents can lead to multiple, non-hierarchical influences on religious law, doctrine and behaviour, and who would like to explore our research data as a historical comparative to current events. 

As this list of potential beneficiaries shows, the impact to be expected from this research is varied. Results of the research have the potential to increase the effectiveness of public policy, for example on religious dissidence and national security. In addition, they have the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services, such as UK based museums and schools, by fostering awareness of the historical role British localities and objects held by British museums played in the larger exchange of people and ideas around Europe and the Mediterranean. In this way our activities also tap into the larger public debate on the potentially artificial distinction between 'British', 'European' and 'Mediterranean' histories. Finally, results from our research may even have the potential to transform historical heritage into economic profit due to the unique combination of famous Church fathers and the topography created by exile, which connects some of the most spectacular tourist destinations, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean (e.g. Alexandria, Istanbul, Cyprus, or Petra), which may well inspire UK and foreign businesses working in the cultural tourism or heritage sector. Some of this impact will be realised and measured during the project's lifetime, though the project's various impact activities (the website, media contributions, the collaboration with museums, and the impact workshop). Staff working on the project, including junior members such as the research associate and the PhD student, will continuously be invited to disseminate their research results for the benefit of a broad and diverse public, particularly via the project blog, and will therefore develop valuable skills in public engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>337852</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Fund application with Profs Dahmen and Kenna</gtr:description><gtr:id>D180AB25-CD97-455B-810A-5A451DC8608A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Women, Peace and Conflict: Gendered Networks in Early Medieval Narratives, Project Grant outline application, submitted to the Leverhulme Trust in January 2017 and passed to full application stage in February 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c66a61dd5e33.58228472-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our PI, Dr Julia Hillner, is currently preparing a funding application with Prof Silvio Dahmen, University of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Prof Ralph Kenna, University of Coventry (as Co-Is) that is building on the results drawn from the application of social network analysis in this project.

It allows for quantitative analysis of features of clerical exile (for example which legal types of exile were imposed on clerics in this period, for spatial analysis (for example patterns of movement of exiled clerics around the Mediterranean) and of their networks (for example, whether some individuals were involved in several cases of clerical exile).</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C572F08-DC16-415C-A63C-C91E63864240</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have presented the database at several research meetings aimed at sharing expertise and practices of digital approaches to late antique studies (with the Late Antique Exile project at Alcala', the Presbyters in Late Antiquity project in Warsaw, the Cult of Saints project in Oxford). In particular we shared our data with the Late Antique Exile project in Alcala' (and they shared their data with us) which helped to make both databases more comprehensive and consistent. Our database is now also actively supporting PhD research (by Noelia Vicent) into locations of late antique exile at the University of Alcala'. The database underpins research now published in Hillner, Ulrich, Engberg, Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity (Peter Lang, 2016), in particular the contributions by Hillner, Rohmann, Engberg and Mawdsley. We also work closely with Sarah Bond (University of Iowa) and Jenny Barry (University of Mary Washington) who are researching the spatial context of clerical exile and are using data from our database for a presentation at the upcoming North American Patristics Society meeting (25-27 Mary 2017).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58be76adb4fc16.13002945</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Clerical Exile in Late Antiquity</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://hrionline.ac.uk/clericalexile/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3123BE9F-1D5D-4D78-ADDD-7520558E4471</gtr:id><gtr:title>Das Martyrion des Babylas und die polemischen Schriften des Johannes Chrysostomos</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Vigiliae Christianae</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/222ee551161d1019f1ea5c32cde4fab4"><gtr:id>222ee551161d1019f1ea5c32cde4fab4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rohmann, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58be80dc7f43c2.81605107</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F11C895-7397-41E7-A70D-3E2C4A42A566</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Early Christian World</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2615416f6989c2ea3c77cb951a651f32"><gtr:id>2615416f6989c2ea3c77cb951a651f32</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Engberg, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c1b07939b8f7.34004803</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A0D29D7-67B6-40F7-9AE8-420DDE37F32B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Christianity, Book-Burning and Censorship in Late Antiquity: Studies in Text Transmission</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8ddd476d3a8eda1b7aac5a47173a4d3b"><gtr:id>8ddd476d3a8eda1b7aac5a47173a4d3b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rohmann Dirk</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9783110486070</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58be803dc2bb96.08325653</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C790B18F-049F-4792-B546-FEF156FBF26D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prison, Punishment and Penance in Late Antiquity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0ec1d6529fdfff8d265643c259274aef"><gtr:id>0ec1d6529fdfff8d265643c259274aef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hillner</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780521517515</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d85021647ba0.49749248</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>00C52FB9-2CB7-4110-8A94-21924FF2FBA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>La construction du sujet exclu (IVe-XIe si&amp;egrave;cle): l'individu, la soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute;
