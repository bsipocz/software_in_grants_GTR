to Understand Uncertain Data</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L026775/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Information overload is a pervasive problem in many environments, particularly those in which human decision making is based on extensive data sets. Data-to-text systems have been shown to successfully address this problem by automatically generating textual descriptions of the underlying data. However, when translating (numerical) data into words, an appropriate level of precision needs to be chosen. The following example is from a system which summarises medical time series data for neonatal care: &amp;quot;At 17:24 T1 is 35.7 and T2 is 34.5C&amp;quot; (Gatt et al., 2009). This summary is clearly targeted to experts, such as doctors or nurses, which need precise information for decision making. However, other users, such as visiting parents might be more happy with a description such as &amp;quot;In the evening your baby had normal temperature.&amp;quot; 

In this project, we will build a data-to-text system that automatically determines the appropriate level of precision for a given context by using statistical machine learning methods. These methods can learn an optimal generation policy from real data and promise to be more robust to new situations than hand-written rules by human experts. 
We will also investigate novel feedback-based non-parametric state estimation methods to reduce the data annotation cost for data-to-text systems. Typically, the first step in creating such systems is to manually interpret and align the raw data sources. However, this step is very costly as human experts need to trained for this task. Our new methods promise for data-to-text systems to be rapidly applied to new domains. 

The domain we will be targeting for this initial project is pedestrian navigation, where the task is to translate uncertain user positions into walking instructions. The underlying data uncertainty here arises from several sources, such as the user's speech signal, the GPS location, estimated viewshed, walking direction and speed. We will integrate and test our learnt data-to-text generation strategy by integrating it in an existing system and running an evaluation with real users.
 
One of the outcomes of this project is a data-driven linguistic view on the question of &amp;quot;how to communicate uncertainty&amp;quot;, which is an active interdisciplinary research area, including researchers from medicine, law, environmental modelling and climate change.
In future work we will also investigate how the proposed framework transfers to new domains, such as natural language generation from medical data, weather forecasts, or output from complex environmental models.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The overall aim of this research is to provide better interfaces for people to understand &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; data more intuitively. As such, the outcomes of this research have three main impact beneficiaries: (1) academic research investigating how to (automatically) communicate data, (2) informing policy makers how to communicate their findings, and (3) the general public needing to make decisions based on (uncertain) data. 

(1) Within the academic community, this proposal aims to bridge the gap between two disciplines, which are both concerned with decision support: data-to-text Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, and interdisciplinary research working on communicating uncertainty. While other disciplines, such as medicine, environmental modelling, climate change or weather forecasts strongly promote the need for communicating data uncertainty, data-to-text systems still assume that their underlying data is precise and correct. If automatic data-to-text systems are to be widely used within decision support, they must have mechanisms to communicate uncertain data in an effective way. This research will contribute a principled study and data-driven framework for generating descriptions of underlying data uncertainty.

(2) The developed models will not only be beneficial to academics from other disciplines, but also to policy makers, such as the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) for example. Currently, the IPCC prescribes a standardised mapping of data uncertainty into words, which is widely recognised and applied beyond climate change research. However, the guidelines by the IPCC are not grounded in linguistic research and have been reported to be problematic in their use. In future, these guidelines could be informed by the outcomes of this research.

(3) Finally, the long-term beneficiary of this research is the general public, who in their daily life have to make decisions based on vast amounts of unstructured information becoming more readily available. For example, the British government recently announced in a white paper that it will be greatly expanding the amount of data which it shares with the rest of us (http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jun/27/public-services-data-published-price). However, most people lack the skills and tools to access and interpret large data sets. The overall aim of this research is to provide better direct access to data through user-friendly interfaces, which help people to understand data more intuitively and support decision making.

The project joined other researchers from Heriot-Watt University to engage with the general public (mainly school children) at Edinburgh Zoo for an afternoon. Our aim was to help children experience the impact of uncertainty on decision making by playing our weather game. A total of 79 participants interacted with the weather game, from which 55 were children between 8 and 14 years old. 
A positive side effect of this activity was, that we gathered data on how children act under uncertainty and also tested their numercy skills. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of such a study being conducted. The data will be published as part of a forthcoming publication (in preparation).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bf41baa00869.86501391</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.explorathon.co.uk/edinburgh/zoo</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organisation and programme chair for 9th International Conference on Natural Language Generation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2BDBEC37-5CF3-41DB-91ED-3B3BA776C736</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Programme chair, local host and organisation for 9th International Conference on Natural Language Generation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b2d3bb6a7751.73084053</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/INLG2016/#</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>1st Workshop on Data-to-text Generation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>583D6B93-6617-4E8E-B89E-AFBBE06B1C77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 1st Workshop on data-to-text covers a broad spectrum of areas aimed at: generating textual descriptions from data, decision support systems to facilitate data access using natural language; information presentation from data, summarisation from data etc. It also aims to bridge the gap between Natural Language Generation and Data Science.

We present a comparison of different information presentations for uncertain data and, for the first time, measure their effects on human decision-making. We show that the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) improves decision-making under uncertainty, compared to state-of-the-art graphical-based representation methods. In a task-based study with 442 adults, we found that presentations using NLG lead to 24% better decision-making on average than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better decision-making when NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women achieve significantly better results when presented with NLG output (an 87% increase on average compared to graphical presentations).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results provide further insights to the question on &amp;quot;how to communicate uncertainty&amp;quot;. This is an active research question in areas such as environmental research, medicine, climate change, or weather forecasting. As such, our findings will help related disciplines to develop better interfaces and give advice to practitioners. For example, our findings have sparked interest from insurance industry, as well as for improving the presentation of search results from search engines, such as Google.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>47141B41-5AF3-4EC8-B945-E76734CF7A1B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0927b45fc88.33396450</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://understandinguncertainty.org/women-listen-and-men-look-how-best-communicate-risk-support-decision-making</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>New MSc Programme in Speech and Multimodal Interaction</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1CB457A-89B2-4535-A5D5-143D383AA47A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Verena Rieser created a new postgraduate MSc programme at Heriot-Watt, which aims to educate highly employable experts in creating conversational multimodal interfaces.

In this one-player game, the player has to choose where to send an ice-cream seller in order to maximise sales, given weather uncertain forecasts for four weeks and two locations. 
We recruited 442 unique players (197 females, 241 males, 4 non-disclosed) using social media.

In contrast to conventional crowd-sourcing, participants are not paid crowd-workers, but the general public. The incentive for the participants is that the game is fun to play and that the game is also educational.
We have tested this method in two different set-ups: The WeatherGame and the for creating the REAL corpus. For example, in the WeatherGame the participants improve their understanding of risk and uncertainty. The REAL corpus, consists of human generated and evaluated object descriptions in spatial real-world images.
