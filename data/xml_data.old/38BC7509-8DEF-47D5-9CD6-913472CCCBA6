Irrigation water Management</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/I022337/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In this project, we propose to investigate the effects of climate change and variability on irrigation water security in India and to evaluate the effectiveness of better irrigation and water management strategies in mitigating any water shortage situation and so improve the productivity of the available water. To assess the impacts of climate change on the runoff and hence on groundwater recharge and inflows into rivers, canals and on-farm reservoir systems at the catchment scale, we will use the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, appropriately calibrated and validated, and a range of GCMs projections and emissions scenarios.

To better understand the impacts on irrigation water requirements at the farm scale, we propose to use an existing physically-based root water uptake model that will be further calibrated and tested using data that will be collected at experimental farms in four diverse climatic zones spread over the four Indian states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarapradesh and Uttarakhand. For future conditions, the calibrated model will be coupled with the SWAT model. 

Given the assessed irrigation water requirements for the future, the adequacy of existing on-farm irrigation infrastructures- direct river abstractions, reservoirs and tube wells- will be assessed in terms of reliability, vulnerability, resilience and sustainability. We propose to develop better operational practices for the infrastructures- e.g. enhanced rule curves for reservoirs, conjunctive use of reservoirs, rivers, groundwater etc- that will temper the effect of water shortages or desynchronise water availability from rainfall on crop production. The project will involve collaboration between internationally-leading scientists at 3 Indian institutions (IIT-Roorkee; NIT-Kurukshetra; NIT, Hamirpur) and 2 UK Universities: Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh (H-WU), Cranfield University (CU). It will build on an existing and thriving collaboration between the H-WU team and the team at the IIT-Roorkee. We will work with stakeholders in India (farmers, regional and regional to national policymakers) and leading UK irrigation practitioners. The project will last for 48 months and comprise four work packages as follows: 

WP 1- Impacts and uncertainty, of climate change on water resources availability for agriculture in India: This WP aims to understand climate change impacts on water availability and to identify thresholds in catchment/aquifer-scale runoff, groundwater recharge and responses (led by CU). 
WP 2- Impacts of shifting temporal and spatial rainfall patterns on crop-soil moisture regimes and potential irrigation demand, and associated field experimentation: The effects of the changing temperature and rainfall patterns on farm-scale soil moisture and hence future irrigation water requirements with be assessed with IIT-R physically-based root water uptake model, which will be further calibrated and validated against observed crop yields and soil moisture data from dedicated field experiments at 4 sites across 4 Indian states (Led by IIT-R).
WP 3- Understanding the potential of robust irrigation water management practices and systems to reduce the impacts of future water scarcity: The effectiveness of on-farm infrastructures will be assessed for their reliability, vulnerability resilience and sustainability to deliver irrigation water needs for existing and climate-change conditions. Better operational practices- irrigation water scheduling; rule and operating policies for on-farm reservoirs; conjunctive use and artificial recharge- that are robust to the uncertainties in the climate change predictions will be developed and evaluated (Led by H-WU)
 WP 4- Stakeholder engagement and dissemination: A broad range of contextually-appropriate engagement and dissemination activities will be co-ordinated by IIT-Roorkee throughout the project duration, to maximise stakeholder buy-in (Joint UK/Indian led).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In this project, our research will inform how food security can be sustained or enhanced when faced with dwindling and/or less reliable water availability resulting from the changing water cycle. At the strategic level, a wide range of organisations with responsibility for policy and practice in relation to water and natural resources, rural development and food security will benefit. These include the National and State Ministries of Agriculture, Rural Development, Earth Sciences, Environment and Forest (national). All this will ensure that our activities complement and contribute to the overarching Impact and Knowledge Exchange plan of the Changing Water Cycle.
The ultimate beneficiaries are small scale, rural Indian farmers who depend on rainfed and irrigated agriculture for their livelihoods, for whom the research will contribute towards improved practices of water management and sustainable irrigation production that are more resilient to climate variability and change. 
Users involved in research to improve our understanding of how climate change interacts with the global to regional water cycle, and the consequent impacts affecting humankind and ecosystems will also benefit from the research outcomes. Given that water resource systems are fundamental to the delivery and maintenance of many ecosystem goods and services including Provisioning (food and freshwater), Regulating (water purification), Cultural (aesthetic, recreational) services upon which society and the environment depend, the proposal will have benefit to a wide range of researchers and practitioners involved in understanding many diverse areas of ecosystem goods and services, e.g. groundwater and surface water modelling, rural development, aquatic ecology, surface water quality etc.
A number of activities will be staged in order to achieve these impacts, including: 
(1)Network development- participating research institutions in India will profit from enhanced technical capacities through close working relations with their UK counterparts while the UK researchers benefit through new knowledge gained from interactions with their Indian counterparts; 
(2)Stakeholder engagement through creation of a multi-stakeholder platform that will link the research team and key end users in India and act as a focal point for a range of outreach and networking activities. The purpose of this is to allow user groups to articulate their needs and priorities, contribute to the research design and implementation; 
(3)Workshops- we will carry out 2 workshops with farmer organizations, central and state government irrigation agencies and agricultural extension advisers at the start and end of the project. These will provide valuable opportunities for two-way learning, allowing improved understanding of climate change impact and the need to improve irrigation practices and to ensure that the research produces contextually-relevant results to maximise impact;
(4)Site visits- We propose a 5 day UK study visit for representatives of the extension services in the State Department of Agriculture in our 4 states and research collaborators, featuring a workshop and site visits to commercial irrigated agriculture facilities mainly in Eastern England. The workshop will be designed and led by RTCS Ltd, a research, training and consultancy services outfit specialising in all aspects of irrigation advice and training; 
(5)Publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at learned conferences; and (6)website- dedicated websites will be developed on each of Heriot-Watt, Cranfied and IIT-R central websites on which outputs from the project will be mounted. This will be enhanced by seeking and obtaining approval for weblinks, e.g. CGIAR, ICARDA, UNESCO, IIED and IAHS, to the project's webpages to increase potential site visitors. Summary outputs will be disseminated to the UNESCO-IHP GRAPHIC, IAH Commission on Groundwater &amp;amp; Climate Change, IAHS Commission on water resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>364736</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>SusHi-Wat: Grant application to the Newton-Bhabha funding</gtr:description><gtr:id>0DED3F20-3BCC-4217-AE7F-A5230C923105</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>566ff16d67f193.73532310-6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They provided the methodological approach to specific work packages of the proposal.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This new research collaboration application led by me (Prof Adeloye) has proposed a research project to investigate the development of tools and management practices for the sustainability of Himalayan water resources in a changing climate.

Consequently, there is little to report on the non-academic impacts. However, two issues are worth reporting at this stage:

? Our finding that climate change will cause summer crop yields to reduce was corroborated by Farmers' representative at a stakeholders workshop in Roorkee in March 2015 who claimed to have started experiencing the decline even now. Our message to start thinking about switching to more heat tolerant and/or less water intensive crops was thus enthusiastically accepted by the farmers at the workshop, including their national president who promised to disseminate the message much more widely. Our effort in this regard has been greatly aided by the bi-lingual (English and Hindi) MICCI Briefing Factsheets provided for distribution to all stakeholders. We will continue to monitor the success of this in years to come.

? We are working with Bhakra-Beas Management Board (BBMB) to test the effectiveness of the newly designed operating policies (with integrated hedging) in enhancing Pong reservoir performance with respect to its two main functions- irrigation and hydro-power generation. Official red-tape and bureaucracy in India make the exchange of data and information extremely difficult but since the project started and confidence has built up on both sides, this problem is gradually disappearing leading to better co-operation. We hope to be able to report on the outcome of this effort on future occasions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CC2F47FB-58F1-4DA1-B224-62780F7331A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d7109a2ee480.94607466</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Aim and Objectives
In MICCI, we have investigated the effects of climate change and variability on irrigation water security in Beas River Basin, India, and evaluated the effectiveness of better irrigation water management strategies that improve the productivity of the available water. The specific objectives of the study are to:
1. Assess the impacts, and uncertainty, of climate change on water resources availability for agriculture within a range of climatically and hydrologically diverse areas across India;
2. Assess the impacts of climate-induced shifting patterns in monsoon rainfall on crop-soil moisture regimes and potential irrigation demand;
3. Develop and evaluate the effectiveness of improved irrigation water management approaches (scheduling, on-farm reservoir operational practices) to achieve stakeholder-relevant outcomes under uncertain impacts on water resources and soil moisture changes;
4. Implement relevant impact plan activities which will ensure that stakeholders- farmers, policy makers, irrigation advisers, researchers, etc.- derive maximum benefits from the project's outcome.

As noted above, the test basin was the Beas and the focus was on its Pong reservoir which meets the irrigation needs of 1.4 Mha of cultivated land and generates hydro-power (396 MW installed capacity) for Himachal Pradesh, the Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan States. The key findings of MICCI are as outlined below:

Key Findings
? In the medium term, most combinations of climate change situations will lead to increased river flows and water availability for agriculture. However, in the longer term, the loss of Himalayan glaciers will lead to significantly reduced flows and water availability under most combinations of climate change. The effect of this on the vulnerability (or maximum single period water shortage) of the Pong reservoir was high (~61%). The development of optimised hedging-integrated operating policy reduced the worst case vulnerability to a mere 20%, which is much more tolerable for most water users. This is obviously a much cheaper option than alternative structural solution involving new infrastructural planning and development.
? A further significant effect of the simulated hydrological situations is to cause reductions in summer crop (e.g. Corn) yield unless the current rain-fed system is supplemented with irrigation. Winter crop production is, however, likely to increase. The decrease in summer crop production with temperature rise is bound to cause concerns for food security in India in the future. To avert this, farmers need to adapt by shifting to temperature resistant varieties or move production to cooler lands. The latter option may not be a problem in the Himalayan region, but could pose significant challenges in low-lying areas of India. 
? Increased temperatures and energy (especially bioenergy) demand may lead to land-use change (conversion of natural vegetation to food and/or bioenergy crops). Although our survey and interviews to gauge this did not reveal huge appetite for this among the bioenergy sector in India, its occurrence if not well managed may lead to increased sediment yield in the Beas Basin with consequences for the performance and operation of the Pong reservoir and other hydraulic structures.
? Our extensive field experiments have revealed large amount of deep percolation losses in the irrigation fields based on current irrigation practices. Reducing these losses will no doubt improve water use efficiency and also help in averting the water shortage problems. Better education of farmers on irrigation water scheduling and more accurate forecasts of rainfall will go a long way in addressing this problem.
? On-farm reservoirs have again been demonstrated to offer a way by which farmers can be in control of their decision making in the application of irrigation water. As shown in our studies, savings of up to 23% in groundwater abstractions can be achieved by installing on-farm reservoirs and harvesting rainfall and runoff. Decision to construct on-farm reservoirs by individual farmers may depend on financial resources available; consequently a commitment by government to offer support through subsidies or other schemes should be considered.
? Data acquisition has been a major constraint in this research and everyone seems powerless to do something about it. It is our view that more hydro-meteorological data should be made available for this kind of studies in the future so that the full benefits of the scientific endeavour will be realisable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? Our calibrated and validated rainfall-runoff model for the Beas Basin is available and can be used by others interested in further hydrological investigations in the Basin or elsewhere. The HYSIM model is very parsimonious in terms of its data requirements and the fact that we have been able to demonstrate its high efficiency in the catchment should engender confidence in its use for future hydrological investigations.
? Our extensive field experiments have resulted in the measurement of actual evapotranspiration for major crops grown in India, including rice, wheat, corn, berseem and mustard. This information, although very important for accurate irrigation water scheduling, is often lacking and has often been indirectly estimated from the theoretical reference crop evapotranspiration. We believe that the availability of the actual evapotranspiration field measurements will be very useful to irrigation engineers and managers in the region for water scheduling purposes. Additionally, the data can be used in accurately characterising crop coefficients for the region, which will be much better than the recommended approach of calibrating these coefficients from values developed for USA conditions.
? The effectiveness of the newly improved rule curves that incorporate hedging in significantly reducing large water shortages should be of use to many other water stressed hot-spots in the world. We have demonstrated through this work that most water resources systems have inherent buffering capacity that improved operational practices can harness. This important aspect of our work has been published as open access, thus making it readily accessible to interested parties. We have also produced Factsheets in Hindi language for the benefit of local farmers and other stakeholders that do not speak English.
? On farm reservoirs are a feature of water management for most farmers in the world, especially where water is scarce and the provision from formalised systems is not reliable but very few studies have quantified the water saving potential of such reservoirs. Our work has demonstrated the huge benefits that on-farm reservoirs have especially in relation to water savings and the empowerment of decision making rights by the typical farmer. Although this aspect of the work is yet to be published, such a quantitative demonstration of on-farm reservoirs water saving and other potentials should justify their more widespread use even in water rich environments.
? Irrigation water application efficiency can be significantly increased if deep percolation losses are curtailed. Our study has successfully demonstrated that the much talked-about low irrigation efficiency in India owes much to the excessive deep percolation losses taking place in the irrigation fields. Although deep percolation depends on the soil characteristics, irrigation water application methods, etc., we believe that the finding in our study will be useful to government irrigation advisory services, farmers, water resources facilities managers, etc. for developing practices for improving the productivity of their water.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6F54EFE7-11C8-4B1C-9811-EE553D58F4EA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6fcb8b566d9.44633285</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://web.sbe.hw.ac.uk/sites/micci/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>MICCI flyers of project findings to disseminate to stakeholders</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4CDBE45-D211-4F38-A756-1096758CD36C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The themed flyers summarising MICCI outcomes are prepared in English and Hindi versions and distributed to stakeholders including farmers, irrigation managers (Pong reservoir managers), engineers from state irrigation departments, NGOs working in watershed management and experts from National Institute of hydrology, IIT Roorkee and NIT Hamirpur and Kurukshetra.
