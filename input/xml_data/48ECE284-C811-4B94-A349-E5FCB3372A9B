These axons are very important for the function of the brain. The axons are often quite long, and a main question in developmental neurobiology is how this axon wiring is achieved. In principle, it can be described such that there is a road map consisting of a number of different guide post molecules positioned at different places between two different neurons which tell these axons which way to go. A number of these molecules have been identified and we would like to understand how they tell the axons which way they have to go to find their other neuron. It might work like this: on the axons there are other molecules which bind the guide post molecules, such that, for example, for guide post molecules named 'ephrins' there are corresponding counter-molecules called 'Ephs' on the axons, which interact only with 'ephrins', and not for example with 'netrins', which is another class of guide post molecules. In fact, the molecules which we would like to understand are these Ephs and ephrins. The contact of an eph molecule on axons with ephrins positioned on the road results in avoidance of this area by this axon. Symbolically, in terms of the road map, it might mean that the car (cable) would approach a one-way street from the wrong side and would turn away. This behaviour is called 'repulsion'. There are other guide post molecules such as netrins, which induce the opposite reaction that is (in this picture) approaching the one-way street from the correct site, inducing an 'attraction', that is the car would drive into this road. For the repulsion, mediated by ephrins, we would like to understand what happens at the very tip of the axon/cable, which is called a growth cone, and when viewed by under a microscope, has a hand-like structure. Inside this growth cone there is a network of tubes and pipes, which are constantly destroyed and re-built, the local balance of which determines the direction in which the growth cone migrates. The Ephs and ephrins control the location and the rate by which the tubes and pipes are destroyed and rebuilt. However, at present the link between the Ephs and ephrins on the one hand, and the tubes inside the growth cone is not clear. In this approach we have designed some experiments to understand this link (in our terms signalling pathways) better. We will use axons from the retina, which normally grow into a part of the brain called the tectum. These retinal axons are very good characterised and some tests are available to analyse the function of Ephs and ephrins. From other guide post systems there are some types of links known, and we will investigate whether these links are also important for Ephs, ephrins and these retinal axons. A point we would like to investigate is the surprising finding that the guide post molecules, the ephrins, can also be expressed on the cables/axons and the Ephs can be found as guide post cells. The meaning of this reversed expression pattern will be a major part of this application.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-bound ephrins are involved in multiple aspects of embryonic development, most notably the formation of spatial boundaries, tissue morphogenesis and control of angiogenesis and axon guidance. A key towards understanding their different roles is their capacity for bi-directional signalling, which means that either the Ephs can function as receptors and the ephrins as ligands ('forward signalling'), or the ephrins function as receptors and the EphAs as ligands ('reverse signalling'). The Eph family can be divided into two subclasses, the EphA and EphB family. In contrast to the advanced understanding of ephrinB reverse signalling, there is only some basic knowledge about that of ephrinAs. A deeper understanding of ephrinA reverse signalling is the aim of this application. As a model, we will use retinal ganglion cells, which have the capacity for reverse signalling. We will use directional and non-directional (proteomics) biochemical approaches to identify ephrinA reverse signalling pathways. To determine which of these pathways are important for axon guidance processes, we will use the growth cone collapse assay, the stripe assay and an organotypic co-culture assay, which allow an investigation of different aspects of axon guidance processes. Here we can characterise and compare the ephrinA-dependent signalling pathways which control growth cone collapse, axon guidance and retinotectal mapping in vitro. There is now good evidence that endocytosis plays a pivotal role in growth cone guidance, making it difficult to view or investigate these two processes separately. We will identify the preferred endocytosis pathway/s of ephrinAs, which - if blocked - also abolish growth cone collapse. We expect to identify molecules involved in both growth cone collapse and endocytosis. Findings made here will be generally applicable, given the widespread expression of ephrinAs and EphAs in and outside the nervous system.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>413059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50029436-1A3D-4357-BC12-2B0A19D65794</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the role of ephrinA2 in auditory function.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Hearing research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/45b7452f781a3710974f8edca0be07d6"><gtr:id>45b7452f781a3710974f8edca0be07d6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ingham NJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0378-5955</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fce36678ee6.42595463</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E1A1199-EE1E-4DEC-898F-D8A2F3F3D64E</gtr:id><gtr:title>EphrinA6 on chick retinal axons is a key component for p75(NTR)-dependent axon repulsion and TrkB-dependent axon branching.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular and cellular neurosciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/08bfc0fd278c653af42c6f341fd06cb2"><gtr:id>08bfc0fd278c653af42c6f341fd06cb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Poopalasundaram S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1044-7431</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d000000d5d3304</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E015522/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
