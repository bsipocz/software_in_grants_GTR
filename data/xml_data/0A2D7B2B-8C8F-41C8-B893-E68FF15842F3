Religious identity is fundamental to many within the Northern Irish community as it permeates education, locality, geography, the built environment and much more. \n\nWhile the religious denominations of Christianity, Protestant and Catholic, are predominant, religious minorities are growing in Northern Ireland. These include Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism, particularly with the increasing numbers of those from ethnic minorities moving to the country. \n\nLocal self 'identity' is determined at a very young age with religious segregation occurring at primary and secondary school level among many communities. \n\nThis research proposal aims to investigate how teenage children from different religious backgrounds perceive certain elements of place, religion and identity, in particular, how they interpret the spatial layout of religious buildings and perceive the relationship between the space and the religion itself.\n\n20 children (4 from each religious background) will be taken to one architectural example of each religion. By means of conversation, drawing and photography, the young people will be encouraged to represent and discuss the space. This will hopefully not only offer insight into the way young people from different cultural backgrounds perceive different religions, but also how they perceive religious space and identity. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34972</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Place' is the Architecture and Built Environment Centre for Northern Ireland.

Spatial Perception of Religious Architecture 

In terms of religious architecture and spatial perception, the research has demonstrated that teenage children aged 12-14 have the clear ability to negotiate and interpret religious space. Teenage children, of that age group, can provide an outline of experienced worship space and identify the areas and objects of importance both from observation and from memory. Interestingly, the study showed that youths tended to be overwhelmed by the objects in the space and as a result disregard the form of architecture and the buildings original purpose and denomination. The composition of the space did not appear to be relevant in any of drawings; however, the majority of teenage children developed and defined each space through a systematic reflection on objects, text and symbology. Overall, they also appeared to adopt natural drawing techniques relatively typical of their age range; using single lines and simplistic plan views. The external space or facade of each building or indeed the buildings location did not seem to be of any significance to the young people, with the exception of using it as a natural way of describing the building. They utilised the basic elements (walls, windows, doors and roofs - i.e. arche-types) to demonstrate their expectations. Basic geometrical primitives for example squares and circles were used. 


Architectural Concepts 

The young people were influenced by a number of architectural concepts identified at the early stages of the project. The youth recognised and responded to these established architectural concepts by demonstrating an ability to compare and contrast spaces. In terms of hierarchy of space it was found that the Christian teenagers were influenced by the structured, authoritarian spatial design of a church. The spatial pattern of each church inherently determined the behaviour and physical movement of the teenage children. As a result, teenage children from both the Protestant and Roman Catholic background were found to be more cautious about entering and exploring unfamiliar religious spaces such as the Synagogue, Temple and Islamic centre. They also displayed a knowledge or tolerance that there are certain spaces in religious buildings which should be respected. Contrastingly, the Hindu youth who appeared to be naturally used to a less structured spatial system of worship felt free to explore each space and ask open questions during the workshop. The study observed that the youth from the Christian faiths were more hesitant in terms of movement and that they waited to be led in and around the space. It was also noted that questions asked were in direction comparisons to their own faith, with many teenage children adopted an 'us' and 'them' attitude, seemingly using the exploration process to reinforce their own sense of identity. 

Purity was another issue of interest although it was represented well through the drawings. The separation of men and women caused major issues among the teenage children from the Roman Catholic and Protestant groups. Issues of sexism against women were raised along with concerns over same-sex attraction. However, it was felt that the young peoples' upbringing, friendship groups and age were related to these concerns more so than religious identity. It was also noted during the study that protestant youth had no visible preparation for worship and this was reflected in their behaviour in each of the worship spaces and within their drawings. 

With reference to orientation it was found that the shape or form of the spaces wasn't necessarily important but the directionality of the space was. The Roman Catholic and Protestant youth, who expected to be led in worship, found it difficult to comprehend disparity to the typical order of space. This confusion mainly occurred in the synagogue where the central platform and Torah platform could both be utilised to lead worship, therefore leading to questions over directionality. Also of interest was the lack of concern about the positioning of the Islamic prayer space on the first floor. The youth did not comment on the location or the orientation of the prayer room but choose to focus on the Mihrab and the direction of the pattern on the carpet. 

Understanding of Religion

In terms of teenage children's perceptions, ideas, understanding of religion, the study showed that 12-14 year olds have well defined religious identities, particularly the Roman Catholic and Protestant teenage children's. The teenage children's appeared to use their own religious identity as a means of understanding and as a means of negotiating and understanding religious space. The spaces were used more as a tool to reinforce their own systems of worship rather than to necessarily understand other faiths. Educational background and maturity also seemed to play a role in their tolerance to other religious cultures. The findings would suggest that the youth play a significant role in shaping their own experiences even within similar physical and social environments. 

In line with the work of Trew (2004) it has been seen that the separation of the two main religious backgrounds; Protestant and Catholic groups, has ensured that the religious views of young people are shaped by a collective; those of the same religion, rather than through experience and direct involvement with those from other religious backgrounds. Particularly, in attempting to understand the spaces, the young people used the process of assimilation to make sense of what they were experiencing. The study also showed that teenage children's held a fear about entering an unfamiliar religious building and this tended to manifest itself through concerns raised at the entrance to each building. Overall the project also highlighted a definite lack of knowledge regarding other religions and a disinterest in architecture. This was particularly evident from the Roman Catholic and Protestant groups. One of the key questions that emerge from this study relates to the level of awareness of young people in Northern Ireland to minority religions. 

In essence, findings would suggest that architecture can be used as a tool to help remove the fears that surround religious identities especially in contested space such as Northern Ireland. The study also promotes that religious architecture has the potential to be a vehicle to address the concerns that young people have regarding different religions and to promote the cross cultural understanding of young people's perceptions of religion and architecture. The study shows that the separation of religion, identity and politics is still difficult in Northern Ireland. Religious spaces are clearly important to young people in Northern Ireland and ultimately become an extension of their identity, but their relationships lies with objects and symbols as opposed to architectural elements. By allowing teenage children's to experience and comprehend other spatial patterns, by providing them with a visual experience and a youth friendly approach; they begin to understand religious identity. They also can develop an appreciation of architecture and their environment when it is brought to their attention.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have set up links with two Universities in Beirut to further this research by comparing the results of this project with a similar political/physical situation.
