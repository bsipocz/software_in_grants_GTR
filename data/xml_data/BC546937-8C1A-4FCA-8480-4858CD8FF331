Confirmed by that investigation team in its interim report on September 16th 2013 the UN investigation team found that the nerve agent Sarin had been used. The UN Secretary-General described this attack as constituting &amp;quot;the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988&amp;quot;. 
Data collected during this project will include government policy documents; media reports; non governmental comment and analysis. Key to the project will be the collection of material from social media platforms. These will span media sharing platforms (e.g. Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr etc.), Networking (e.g Facebook, Linkedin etc.) Blogs (e.g. Wordpress, tumblr) Microblogs (Twitter), Discussion platforms (Reddit) the more innovative sources such as crowdsourcing sites (ushahidi, irevolution, etc.) and live streaming services such as Bambuser. These materials constitute citizen reporting on the events related to the UN report and on the conduct of the investigation itself. The richness of the media means that useful data is collected both intentionally and unintentionally within meta data and background information. To increase the utility of these data a series of initial analysis papers and/or detailed thematic chronologies will be generated as well as a searchable database. 
The collection of information relating to the United Nations confirmation of nerve agent use in Syria is an important task for a number of reasons including:
1. The confirmation of use has set in motion a series of unexpected events which have potentially profound consequences, not just for how in the future allegations of chemical weapons use are dealt with, but also for scholars in areas such as international relations, regional studies, toxicology and international law. 
2. International responses to the allegation of use have given unusual weight to data produced by non governmental sources. This includes for example, intelligence agencies publicly referencing Internet and social media evidence as indicative of a chemical attack occurring with such force that a potential kinetic response was considered. The value of such material, as intelligence or court admissible evidence, is yet to be decided including how such material should be gathered and presented to be admissible.
3. Already we are witnessing data relating to the investigation 'disappearing' from public view as narratives concerning, for example, who authorised the use of the nerve agent are debated. Near contemporary collection of data therefore generates a more accurate repository and acts as a witness to such events, and in particular gives victims a voice in future academic and policy shaping analysis.
4. Past experience concerning allegations of chemical and biological weapons use suggests that data will continue to 'disappear' from public (and therefore academic) view as a narrative becomes dominant. Failure to collect information now that attests to multiple narratives may result in future research being based on incomplete or potentially flawed or otherwise contaminated dataset.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact plan builds on the team's outstanding track record of impact across a range of audiences. The PI and Co-I have been involved in a range of communication and engagement activities and have built an extensive range of contacts with stakeholders including senior policy actors directly interested in preventing CBW use. 
The research is of significant relevance to users outside the academic community particularly those concerned with the development of robust national and international investigation mechanisms for allegations of chemical and biological weapons as well as operational personnel capable of delivering investigations. These include international organisations such as the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Health Organization, policy makers, civil servants, the security community, including police, NGO workers and campaigners. More generally, NGOs and organisations concerned with monitoring potential war crimes will also find this project and its outputs a useful resource. The International Committee of the Red Cross for example have a particular interest in monitoring such situations and will be engaged during the course of this project. 
In the UK, government departments such as the FCO and DFID and the MoD will be contacted early on. The Ministry of Defence for example has significant interest in the handling of 'open source intelligence' and the methodological approach used in this project may be beneficial to a number of their projects within DSTL and Niteworks open source intelligence project (see pathways to impact). 
The outputs will be primarily disseminated as the Harvard Sussex Program Occasional Papers, and via its powerful contacts database which contains c.1500 entries. Use will also be made of the various expert email groups and listservs the project team belongs to and the various opportunities and invitations to speak which we regularly receive. 
Both the PI and Co-I are deeply committed to communicating their research in an accessible manner to non-academic communities and so will produce succinct materials accessible to a wider audience to be disseminated along established channels in national newspapers and specialist journals. For example, together with the partner organisation, the PI will write for CBRNe World a magazine which serves the information needs of professionals around the world charged with planning for or responding to a CBRNe threat or incident.
The research team also intends to host a seminar that will function as both a means of communicating emerging outputs and co-producing the future programme of research. The project partner will also enable a presentation at the Cranfield University CBRN Symposium in 2014, the longest running CBRN conference in the UK. These occasions will also provide an opportunity to be advised on how current outputs might be tailored to be of maximum use to stakeholders. In organising our seminar we will also exploit our links to younger scholars - an increasingly important activity because the community of academics engaged in this area is suffering from demographic problems with many of the leaders nearing retirement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>135561</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with LSE/SPRU project on Strategic Governance of Science and Technology Pathways to Security References (ES/K011324/1)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D553DB2B-DAFD-4652-86B8-01F2B5D4E20D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Early draft papers on Social media and Syrian chemical weapons allegations were submitted for discussion at workshops of the LSE led project</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bc67e9622601.90599250-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Contributions primarily in terms of knowledge exchange and experiences, particularly in relation to Syria and Social media.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This partnership involved - and continues to involve - knowledge exchange and interaction between the HSP and LSE.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the UCL/SPRU project: Understanding Biological Disarmament: The Historical Context of the Origins of the Biological Weapons Convention, AH/K003496/1</gtr:description><gtr:id>DCEBFD02-EBC4-4E0B-9C3C-386996050EE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guardian Blog: The Geneva Protocol at 90: An Anchor for Arms Control? 17th June 2015 (See outputs)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bc989f273650.60894796-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Historical understandings of the role of the Geneva Protocol in the arms control disarmament architecture.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Contemporary understandings of the Geneva Protocol and United Nations Secretary General's Investigatory Mechanism, especially as they apply to the situation in Syria.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of Paper at workshop ran by Kings College London on Open Source Intelligence</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D82D139A-D5EC-470A-B7FE-6E70E974FCF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Steve Johnson presented a Syria project paper, a Comparative Analysis of the Online Behaviors Exhibited in Incidents where there is Doubt about Veracity, to participants at a workshop on Open Source Intelligence hosted by Kings College London.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5730571f17de76.11148197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SPRU work in progress seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C75EAA30-99B5-4BED-87B4-6AFCD145B258</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I present the Syria project work at one of SPRUs work in progress seminars with the intended purpose of disseminating initial findings from the project.

Dr James Revill gave a presentation on the adoption of chemical and biological weapons by non-state actors at the 12th International Symposium on Protection against Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, June 8-10 2016, Stockholm, Sweden.

Dr Revill outlined several key factors that can be seen as influential in the adoption of chemical and biological agents including the perceived utility of such weapons, their complexity, compatibility with both ideology and organisation, visibility and the broader environmental context.

He also gave an overview of validated historical examples adoption of Chemical and Biological Weapon (CBW) technology by non-state actors to illustrate the significance of such factors, but also to highlight the relatively small number of real events compared with the number of hoaxes and non-events.

The presentation concluded with a note on the potential of Daesh use of chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq, and it was suggested that whilst the opportunistic use of crude chemical weapons was an ongoing concern, the use of CBW on a mass destructive scale would face a significant number of challenges.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5772487a60bdd9.95990159</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.foi.se/en/Our-Services/Conferences-and-Seminars/12th-CBW-Protection-Symposium/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>James Revill serves as Rapporteur at the second United Nations SecretaryGeneral's Mechanism Designated Laboratories workshop in Spiez.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2DB3D038-8ED3-44C0-A723-69067D076804</gtr:id><gtr:impact>James Revill served as rapporteur for the second Spiez United Nations SecretaryGeneral's Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) Designated Laboratories workshop, between the 22 - 24 June 2016.

From this a number of working papers were written that provided an initial analysis of our data collection, and which were presented at an international workshop hosted by the project team. As the conflict in Syria continues, so too the allegations of chemical weapons use, it is still too early to say how the findings from our data collection have been used. Moreover, it is too soon to say whether our data collection (the main output of this project) will be used in the future by the accountability mechanisms that are now being set up in relation to chemical weapons use, although as one workshop participant noted of online materials pertaining to Ghouta &amp;quot;You might be the only ones who gathered that data&amp;quot;. Nevertheless it is possible to begin to identify areas that have resonated in the open domain with non-academic audiences. We have for example been called to participate in high level international meetings on aspects of the investigation into alleged uses of chemical weapons (see participation in successive UNSGM Designated Laboratories workshops for example), and invited to present at policy meetings on chemical and biological terrorism (see CBW Protection symposium) and issues pertaining to the use and manipulation of social media during conflicts (see for example Niteworks and Brigade Study Day engagement activities). In particular this latter aspect seems to be attracting attention. Our work on propaganda and narrative building about the Ghouta attack and in particular the 'faking' aspect has been requested by government departments to inform their discussions about the impact of social media on strategy. In one instance this led directly to the authoring of a concept paper for UK Defence Concepts and Doctrine Centre on this issue.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C9310799-F16B-4529-A82A-CDB9EB3DD774</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df5bb505af50.24560039</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through the preliminary analysis conducted during this project, the following key findings were developed. 
1. The project has suggested that the ways in which chemical weapons (CW) are being used in Syria might be indicative of a new utility for them - one of 'tactical terrorisation' whereby relatively small amounts of toxic chemical are delivered by crude means to key nodes of resistance for purposes other than killing. This suggested new utility is considerably different to the Cold War assumptions of chemical warfare that underpin the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and as such may constitute a potential threat to the future relevance of that Convention. Indeed, the Syria case presents the CWC and its implementing organisation, the OPCW, with a number of potentially significant and serious challenges. These should be the subject of considered research. 
2. The project has found that as with other forms of data detailing alleged CW use, online data about should not be used without a great deal of circumspection, as it too contains much that is unreliable, incomplete - and often contains error, lies and spin. Traditional and social forms of media were found to have acted as a superconductor for Ghouta-related information. Whilst this militates against the hiding of &amp;quot;bad news&amp;quot; from populations and provided valuable insights that something had happened in the Ghouta district, the project found that the data brings us no closer to understanding exactly what happened and who was responsible. Our initial analysis for example has found at least eight competing narratives or sub-narratives about what happened, that have resonated widely. Whilst some of these can now be dismissed, several competing explanations continue to exist online generating a pervasive sense of uncertainty amongst the general public and experts. Indeed we found the uncertainty about who was responsible for the Ghouta attacks being repeated to create uncertainty about responsibility for more recent allegations of use. 
3. Related to this however, the project found that inserting online an entirely fake narrative about a chemical-related incident is difficult to do without the author becoming part of a real online community. This massively increases the effort required to maintain fake incident narratives and so offers the researcher the means to identify such cases. Our initial analysis suggests there may be a series of potential online behavioural markers that might assist a future CW (or BW) allegation verification process. These should be subjected to further tests.
4. Finally, as online platforms are likely to continue to be a dominant medium through which allegation and related information are shared, the project found that those collecting and analysing such data, face a number of particular ethical-related issues, including responsibilities for the wellbeing of sources of the social media data being collected as well as for future users of collected data. These should be the subject of further elaboration and exploration. As some of these issues cross the academic-practioner divide we believe that a valuable academic contribution could be to work with practioners with the aim of co-constructing common ethical principles that can be applied in any analytical setting.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Several of the specific initial analysis findings and recommendations from this project could be taken forward and the process of co-production of knowledge and interaction with policy makers and governmental experts has already led to fruitful discussions on how such findings could be advanced by academics or government and international agencies following CW/Syria issues. Although these are findings from initial analysis only, the possibility of their being a new utility for chemical weapons being demonstrated that may affect the standing of the chemical weapons regime should be taken forward by further academic research. The comparative analysis of three chemical related incidents (one known to be fake, a second that has been verified and a third of unknown provenance) to suggest potential online behaviour markers that could assist in future verification processes has already generated much interest and needs to be developed and tested by an interdisciplinary team of experts. The role of online platform in allegation related information dissemination and subsequent narrative construction relating to accountability also provides fertile ground for further exploration by academics and policymakers alike. These research outcomes will continue to be disseminated at conferences and meetings and taken forward through publication.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>68A79B39-8B73-4CBA-A37D-16BEEEC34765</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df5bdf8a8552.04800130</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Project partner Steve Johnson passed project papers to Mod and SOCOM.
