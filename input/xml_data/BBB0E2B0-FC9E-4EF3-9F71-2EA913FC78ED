This will require the deployment of arrays of large numbers (&amp;gt;50) to provide electrical energy on a commercially viable basis. Such arrays would potentially extend along many kilometres of UK coastlines. While limited work has been carried out into the potential environmental impact of single devices, the impact that arrays may have on the flow-field together with possible resulting effects on marine ecosystem processes is unknown. Forecasting the hydrodynamic changes resulting from array installation is difficult but is a core requirement of the industry; considerable effort is being put in to this field by commercial and academic research groups. Ecological surveys and studies to investigate ecological effects are time consuming and costly and are generally reactive; a more efficient approach is to develop 2 and 3D linked hydrodynamic-ecological modelling which has the potential to be reactive and to allow forecasting of the effects of array installation.
 
Arising from this background, the overall aim of the project is to demonstrate the ability to numerically model the change in ambient hydrodynamics resulting from the installation of wave and tidal device arrays and to couple the model output to associated ecological models to allow prediction of associated changes in benthic habitats and dynamics, plankton growth and fish communities. 

To achieve this aim the proposal incorporates a series of objectives based on the exploitation of different modelling approaches using both 2 and 3D modelling. The software to be used will include (i) MIKE, a family of modelling tools developed by DHI which is widely used by the majority of marine consultants in the UK. The package includes the associated Ecolab ecological processes model which is widely used in Australasia for a range of environmental assessments especially in the coastal zone. (ii) Other high resolution hydrodynamic models such as Fluidity-ICOM and GOTM and (iii) the ERSEM ecological model which will be linked to output from the hydrodynamical models in (ii). Models in (ii) and (iii) are all widely recognised within the research community. A major novelty of the project is that it will thus make use of a range of readily available commercial and open source software. This approach will allow two main goals to be achieved: (i) Demonstration that output and results are not model specific and (ii) the development of open source tools will have the potential for the research approach to be enjoyed by the wider community. 
 
The proposal fully recognises the complexity of ecological processes. An initial objective of the project will therefore be to parameterise the relevant biological processes, especially relating to benthic detrital dynamics, plankton growth and fish population dynamics, in order to effectively run a coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model. These parameterisations will then be tested to give realistic results with respect to inter- and intra-annual variation of tidal and wave climate conditions without the presence of any Marine Energy Converters (MECs) before application to situations involving array deployments. Special focus will be given to the potential positive effects of array deployments arising from the changes in the hydrodynamics and establishment of no-fishing zones.

The importance of the work will be the value of this ground-breaking R &amp;amp; D for end-users, spanning the commercial developers of marine energy devices, environmental consultants and the regulatory authorities. The project has been designed specifically for use by all sectors of the industry in order to accelerate the development of marine renewable devices by allowing forecasting of the environmental consequences of array deployments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outcomes of the project will principally benefit the UK marine renewable energy industry, particularly the commercial developers of marine energy device arrays, marine environmental consultants and national marine regulatory authorities. There will also be certain wider benefits to the general public primarily through optimising environmental sustainability and impact reduction against the urgent need to encourage the development of marine renewable resources. 

The UK is, arguably, at the forefront in the development of marine renewable energy devices and arrays. However, with the deployment of any such devices there will always be a cost to the environment. Establishing the resulting change to the environment is not easy owing to the complexity of the factors contributing to the change including, for example, the specific design of the wave or tidal energy devices to be used, the design of the array and local physical and environmental influences. In addition the complexities of the marine ecosystem make it particularly challenging to carry out convincing observations. At present observational programmes are usually based on monitoring carried out before and following the installation of the device: such an approach is reactive in nature. It is much more desirable to take a pro-active approach which has the potential to allow forecasting of environmental consequences. 

The impact of the project will be maximised by employing a modelling approach. Application of the model to proposed device array sites will allow forecasts to be made of the effects of the array on two main ecosystem components, the benthos and the fisheries. This in turn will allow predictions to be made of the device array on the economics of local fishing industries and on the effects on biodiversity and stability of the indigenous benthic communities. This will be of considerable assistance to national regulatory bodies and others in the drive to establish limits to ecosystem modification associated with commercial marine energy extraction. In a broader context the outcomes of the study will provide a solid component for the development of a national protocol for the marine renewable energy industry in relation to the environment. The establishment of such standards would be a major boost to the industry by shortening the consultation process on environmental acceptability of such schemes.

The project will also benefit the marketing base of the UK marine renewable energy industry by allowing developers to offer a more integrated management package to potential customers. The attractiveness of the model to be developed will be enhanced by its flexibility allowing a range of environmental parameters of local interest to be incorporated in the model as required. Development of the model, especially the ecological component, will be assisted by liaison with DHI, Denmark; the extensive international links of this company will enhance the impact of the project internationally. Underpinning the overall model are two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic sub-models which reflect the UK lead in the field of flow prediction in the vicinity of marine energy device arrays: this again will enhance the impact of the project by providing greater confidence to potential customers. 

The benefits arising from the project will be realised at the end of the project and beyond. However essential foundations for gaining the full impact benefits will be laid over the course of the project: this will be done through an Advisory Forum and through wider contacts. 

While the PDRAs employed for the project will be focussed on the hydrodynamic and ecological modelling, they will receive training in knowledge exploitation and will be expected to participate actively in establishing working links with end-users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1020066</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>500000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>H2020 PowerKIte</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8C85C393-03D2-40AE-B0FC-35ADB6B50C96</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df2ef0320c89.90046297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Statement of Impact

Turbine correction parameter
For coarse grid resolutions (kilometre scale) the resulting force exerted on the flow agrees well with the theoretical value. However the force starts decreasing with decreasing grid sizes when these become smaller than the length scale of the wake recovery. This is because the assumption that the upstream velocity can be approximated by the local model velocity is no longer valid. Using linear momentum actuator disc theory however, we derive a relationship between these two velocities and formulate a correction to the enhanced bottom drag formulation that consistently applies a force that remains closed to the theoretical value, for all grid sizes down to the turbine scale. We show how the corrections can be applied (demonstrated here for the models MIKE 21 and Fluidity) by a simple modification of the drag coefficient.

? Optimising design of tidal stream turbine farms
A new approach for optimising the design of tidal stream turbine farms is presented by a turbine density function that specifies the number of turbines per unit area and an associated continuous locally-enhanced bottom friction field. The farm design question is formulated as a mathematical optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water equations and solved with efficient, gradient-based optimisation methods. The resulting method is accurate, computationally efficient, allows complex installation constraints, and supports different goal quantities such as to maximise power or profit. The outputs of the optimisation are the optimal number of turbines, their location within the farm, the overall farm profit, the farm's power extraction, and the installation cost.

? Potential environmental impact of tidal energy extraction at large spatial scales
A model study was carried out of the potential large-scale (&amp;gt;100 km) effects of marine renewable tidal energy generation in the Pentland Firth, using the 3D hydrodynamics-biogeochemistry model GETM-ERSEM-BFM. A realistic 800 MW scenario and an exaggerated academic 8 GW scenario were considered. The realistic 800 MW scenario suggested minor effects on the tides, and undetectable effects on the biogeochemistry. The academic 8 GW scenario suggested effects would be observed over hundreds of kilometres away with changes of up to 10% in tidal and ecosystem variables, in particular in a broad area in the vicinity of The Wash. There, waters became less turbid, and primary production increased with associated increases in faunal ecosystem variables. Moreover, a one-off increase in carbon storage in the sea bed was detected.

? Tidal devices and benthic communities
Current speed, together with bottom type and depth, strongly influence benthic community distributions; however the interaction of these factors in controlling benthic dynamics in high energy environments is poorly understood. Over almost the 1 m/s velocity range, no changes in benthic communities were observed. This suggested that the high physical disturbance associated with the high current flows in the Strangford Narrows reflected the opportunistic nature of the benthic species present with individuals being continuously and randomly affected by turbulent forces and physical damage. It is concluded that during operation, the removal of energy by marine tidal energy arrays is unlikely to have a significant effect on benthic communities in high flow environments.

? Adaptive Haar wavelets for the angular discretisation of spectral wave models
A new framework for applying anisotropic angular adaptivity in spectral wave modelling is presented. The angular dimension of the action balance equation is discretised with the use of Haar wavelets, hierarchical piecewise-constant basis functions with compact support, and an adaptive methodology for anisotropically adjusting the resolution of the angular mesh is proposed. This work allows a reduction of computational effort in spectral wave modelling, through a reduction in the degrees of freedom required for a given accuracy, with an automated procedure and minimal cost.

? NZPD model using EcoLab coupled to a hydrodynamic model
Changes in hydrodynamics as a result of tidal turbine arrays may have an effect on the dynamics of biological systems. A Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus model was developed in EcoLab by DHI which was coupled to the idealised hydrodynamic domain developed in this project with (55 turbines) and without turbines. Both scenarios were run for a full year to capture the dynamics such as the spring bloom and later decline of phytoplankton concentrations and results were analysed statistically. Results suggest that natural occurring spatial variations in concentration of phytoplankton are greater than that can be attributed to an array of tidal turbines alone.
