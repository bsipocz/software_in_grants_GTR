An example of such a situation would be a universe in the shape of a 3-dimensional sphere embedded in 4-dimensional Euclidean space: if one moves along a straight line (geodesic) in this universe one eventually comes back to the starting point. And suppose that there is only one particle living in the universe, a massless neutrino. The study of the behaviour of this single particle is a typical example of the class of mathematical problems that we propose to examine.

It may seem that there is little practical value in studying the highly idealised situation described above. However, it may in the long run help us understand the internal structure of the neutrino, tell us why neutrinos propagate with the speed of light and why they carry spin, explain the difference between the neutrino and antineutrino, give us a clearer picture of how neutrinos interact with gravity etc.

The massless neutrino is described mathematically by a system of two equations which, taken together, are called &amp;quot;massless Dirac equation&amp;quot;. The massless Dirac equation is the accepted mathematical model for the neutrino and the corresponding antiparticle, antineutrino. This equation models the neutrino as a wave running through our universe. The aim of the research project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of a class of systems of equations, of which the massless Dirac equation is a characteristic representative.

The main difficulty here is that our wave-like solution has a complicated structure because the universe over which this wave propagates is curved. The plan is to tackle this difficulty by means of a mathematical technique called &amp;quot;microlocal analysis&amp;quot;. Microlocal analysis is a powerful mathematical technique developed by Lars Hormander (Fields Medal 1962). Though the subject of microlocal analysis is highly technical (Hormander's book runs into 4 volumes), the underlying idea is quite straightforward: we assume, in the first approximation, that our universe is flat, construct our wave-like solution explicitly and then correct it by taking account of the curvature of our universe.

Microlocal analysis has been applied with great success to the study of scalar (single) equations. As explained above, the massless Dirac equation is actually a system of two equations and the fact that it is a system makes the structure of the wave-like solution particularly complicated and its study fascinating.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. The 2010 International Review of Mathematical Sciences expressed the following concern:

&amp;quot;Despite progress since 2004, analysis in the UK is still under-represented compared to the rest of the world, with a notable shortage of home-grown talent; efforts to strengthen existing excellent groups in analysis of all sizes should accordingly be continued&amp;quot;.

The proposed project would result in the employment and training of a Research Associate at UCL, which would address the above concern.

2. The 2010 International Review of Mathematical Sciences stated:

&amp;quot;The part of geometry that needs most strengthening in the UK is the connection between geometric analysis and partial differential equations&amp;quot;.

The proposed research is on the borderline between the analysis of partial differential equations and differential geometry, so it is exactly in the subject area identified by the International Review as an area that needs strengthening.

3. We intend to bring three prominent overseas mathematicians to the UK for approximately one month each (over several visits). During their visits, these mathematicians would collaborate with the PI and visit other universities with seminar and colloquium talks, thus sharing their expertise with the UK mathematical community.

4. In line with common practice in mathematics, the results will be disseminated via publications in academic journals as well as the preprint server http://arxiv.org/. We will also present our results at national and international mathematical meetings and conferences.

5. UCL has two distinct research groups in pure mathematics: a well established group in the rigorous analysis of PDEs and a recently created geometry and topology group. The proposed research project would encourage interaction between these two groups which, up till now, have functioned independently.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>364831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A568DCB0-C371-476B-AF26-5CD50D5990BB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analytic definition of spin structure</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Mathematical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e78cf01a3a19141a081ad3f8016ceddf"><gtr:id>e78cf01a3a19141a081ad3f8016ceddf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Avetisyan Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe5e7497532.68975766</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BCE6F8B4-35C4-4A09-8B47-8B2C5C4250AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spectral asymptotics for first order systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Spectral Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e78cf01a3a19141a081ad3f8016ceddf"><gtr:id>e78cf01a3a19141a081ad3f8016ceddf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Avetisyan Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a360585a97e1.84111128</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B6545267-0B72-4E63-AF1D-DCECF407312F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analysis as a source of geometry: a non-geometric representation of the Dirac equation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a2f0b29e2f955d2b9297e508053e8bff"><gtr:id>a2f0b29e2f955d2b9297e508053e8bff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fang Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>55474ac2be2282.44769100</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9EF98A79-9AF9-44FB-8007-FC01990BF8BB</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Analyst's Take on Gauge Theory</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dcf8be192f866a3876f85417cb91b6ff"><gtr:id>dcf8be192f866a3876f85417cb91b6ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vassiliev D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a995b18ca22a2.46869087</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B60B5E2E-1734-4756-B2BA-3399A8CBD293</gtr:id><gtr:title>SPECTRAL THEORETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MASSLESS DIRAC ACTION</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mathematika</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/85a07d0891fd1f6b55de0cdbb6ca778d"><gtr:id>85a07d0891fd1f6b55de0cdbb6ca778d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Downes R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d5fab216711.68073387</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M000079/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
