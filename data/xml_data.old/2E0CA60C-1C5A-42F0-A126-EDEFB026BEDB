As anyone whose child has learned to escape their car seat knows, preschool children have a remarkably fast and powerful ability to learn by observing others? causal actions.

&lt;p>We will first use a computational model to predict how learners should learn from different demonstrations. We will then conduct a study examining what learners of different species actually do. In this study, children, chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys will observe a human demonstrator perform two actions (eg pulling a lever and turning a dial) on a puzzle box. Only the second action causes reward production, but the first action is more plausibly necessary if the actor performs it on purpose, or in mechanical contact with the reward. The question is whether these variables affect the tendency of different species to perform the 'unnecessary' action in the sequence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;This research will help us to understand the ways in which human cognition differs from that of other primates, and when these evolutionary changes might have occurred.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public engagement with science
The evolutionary origin of cognition is an exciting area of scientific inquiry, and one that has broad public interest. Members of the public will benefit from this research by being able to observe and learn about the research while it is in progress at venues such as the Edinburgh zoo and local libraries and science museums. Scientific research is generally conducted in laboratories and is relatively invisible to the public. Allowing members of the public to observe and participate in research will raise awareness of and interest in cognitive science research and scientific inquiry in general. We particularly expect this work to benefit preschool and school age children, by allowing them to both observe and actively participate in science. 

Increased understanding of children's learning abilities
In the medium and longer term, we expect that the results of the proposed experiments will improve our understanding of children's cognitive abilities and in particular, will have broad implications for how pedagogy and expertise can influence children's learning. Previous research by the PI and others has already generated interesting implications for teaching, suggesting that direct instruction can enhance but also has the potential to interfere with learning. The proposed research will therefore provide important insights into how children learn from teachers, both formally in the classroom and informally in the world.
 
Benefits to teachers, schools and educational policy makers
Even in domains such as causal learning, where explicit instruction is not needed for learning to take place, children are influenced by the information they receive from others. This research will inform our understanding of the impact instructors' words and demonstrations can have on children, and we expect that in the longer term our results will contribute to advances in education policy, especially approaches to early instruction in preschool and grade school settings, and changes in teacher training and education. 

Benefits to parents and families
The proposed work looks at the role of what is called &amp;quot;natural pedagogy&amp;quot; in children's learning. Natural pedagogy is the informal teaching stance that most adults intuitively take when interacting with young children. This instinctive teaching approach is used not only by teachers in the classroom, but also by parents and other caregivers in their day to day lives. Therefore, results from this research may benefit caregivers and the children they care for, by helping us to understand the best ways for them to encourage children's natural learning abilities. 

Benefits to zoo animals and primates in captivity
The proposed experiments with primates at the Edinburgh Zoo involve challenging social and physical reasoning problems. Participating in these experiments provides primates with species appropriate stimulation and cognitive enrichment. In the longer term, we expect that the research proposed here will increase our understanding of non-human primate cognition and social behavior, allowing for the design of improved, species appropriate enrichment activities, social interactions and housing structures in zoos and other situations where primates are kept in captivity. Boredom, social isolation and high stress levels are serious health and welfare problems for captive animals, especially social and intelligent animals such as primates. Results of this research will help zoos and animal caretakers to avoid or mitigate these issues.

Benefits to primate conservation and policy
We expect the results of this research to contribute to the understanding of primate cognition and primate social behavior. The primates involved in this research belong to species that are threatened or endangered. Developing appropriate and effective animal management, conservation and breeding programs, requires understanding species-typical behavior to be successful.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242111</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rainbow Nursery, St Andrews</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Rainbow Nursery</gtr:description><gtr:id>782938DC-FD18-47C1-90B8-1458A6F3A0A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based on the success of us running our study at the nursery, other researchers from the University of St Andrews have now set up a collaboration with the nursery and will continue to run studies there.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464f0c228f338.24158472-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The nursery assisted us in recruiting participants for our study and provided an area for us to run the study in.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We ran a study with 3- to 5-year old children at this nursery.

Following their child's participation, several parents asked if they could invite their friends to participate in our research, which meant we were able to increase our sample size as well as engaging more members of the public in science.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546500704a3116.19794601</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk for zoo staff at Edinburgh Zoo</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2CA3214B-CB34-4D47-B459-34C99B9C07CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DB gave a talk about our research to zoo staff, which improved understanding of the research questions we are trying to address within the institution at which we were running our studies.

Zoo policy and zoo animals
-Techniques developed in this research have informed researcher training at the Living Links facility at the Edinburgh zoo. Best practices we helped develop for familiarization with the monkeys, moving monkeys between cubicles and otherwise interacting with monkeys are in use 
-Games based on our statistical sampling experiments are now being used more broadly for species appropriate capuchin monkey enrichment, improving the lives and experience of zoo animals

Public Knowledge
-Our participation in a variety of public outreach events through the Edinburgh zoo as well as science festivals has increased public understanding of developmental psychology and comparative cognition research. We often receive media and general interest inquiries based on participation in Chimp on Trial and other outreach events
-We are working to bring Bright Club, the academic stand up comedy outreach and education program that DB participated in to Canada
-Our work in nurseries similarly helped to expose children to science and to familiarize their parents and teachers with the scientific process

Education Policy
-Research growing from these studies has been expanding our understanding of how children learn from direct instruction versus their own exploration. This research has been presented to policy groups in Canada and is likely to have broad policy implications for nursery and early childhood education

Community Partnerships
-The partnership with the Edinburgh zoo at the centre of this grant has been used as a model for devleoping similar partnerships with the Royal Ontario Museum and the Ontario Science Centre
-Researchers continue to actively conduct research and outreach activities in these community locations

Technology
-The models developed in this grant are contributing to the development of AI tools that will in the medium and long term contibute to better human computer interaction. We are in the process of applying with UK collaborators for an EPSRC grant to pursue these impacts directly</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD3CBB48-9F01-4496-BB64-AEE44972DDAD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>59d260ae2ee756.28317434</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through empirical research and computational modelling, this project has generated significant new knowledge that sheds light on the evolution and origins of causal and social reasoning, as well as what constitutes the uniquely human mind. We collected directly comparable data from young children and capuchin monkeys, to examine how different types of social demonstration and prior physical knowledge influence these two species' interpretation of cause and effect. Both children and capuchin monkeys differentiated between demonstrations that differed in terms of the intentionality of the human demonstrator and the causal plausibility of the actions demonstrated in surprisingly similar ways, as revealed by the amount that participants performed the first 'unnecessary' action in the demonstrated sequence in the different conditions. This approximated data predicted by a model in which learners take all levels of intentionality and causal plausibility into account. However, there were striking differences in the finer details of behaviour, in particular the degree to which two-action sequences were copied. Children, but not monkeys, produced more sequences in the intentional and pedagogical conditions. This suggests that ostensive communicative cues might affect copying behaviour in both species, but suggest that perhaps only children interpret the demonstrations as instructional.

Through running this project, a new collaboration with a researcher at the University of St Andrews has been developed, and we plan to continue to work together to run a number of follow-up studies and apply for additional funding to continue work on this topic.

DB gained extensive hands-on experience of conducting research with non-human primates. This was particularly valuable as she intends to continue with comparative psychology research in her newly established lab at the University of Toronto.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our finding that young children are more likely to copy when the person they are learning from uses explicit pedagogical cues has important implications for teachers, schools and education policy makers. As a result of this project we have enhanced our understanding of the social conditions under which children learn best by observing others; information that can also benefit parents and caregivers by enabling them to enhance natural learning.

The experiments that we conducted with capuchins and chimpanzees at Edinburgh Zoo involved presenting the primates with challenging problems to solve, and thus constituted an important form of stimulation and cognitive enrichment. Our finding that capuchins may be more attuned to human social cues than previously thought has increased our understanding of primate cognition and social behaviour, which in turn enables the design of more species-appropriate enrichment activities; an essential part of improving welfare for captive animals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7DBA13C0-A4A2-4A86-9156-ABCBEB881EFE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54b0314a00f9b9.47845527</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We developed computational models of social and causal learning to help predict the behaviour of different human and non-human learners
