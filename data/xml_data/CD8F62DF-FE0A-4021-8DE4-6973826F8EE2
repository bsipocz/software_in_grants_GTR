As a result, the public is currently spoilt for choice if they want to learn about science, with public engagement activities taking a variety of forms, including science festivals, public lectures, writing lay blogs and articles and Cafe Scientifique. But are these events attended by the general public, or are scientists preaching to a small choir? Audiences at scientific events indeed tend to be highly engaged but are self-selecting and are not representative of the
broad public sector.

This project aims to achieve wider participation for public engagement of science by bringing STFC science to a new audience: the people who do not have the opportunity/funds/time/inclination to go to their local university's open lab event, but who do enjoy visiting their local art festival. It will do so using the Soapbox Science approach: a no-frills, grass-roots outreach initiative which invites active research scientists to stand on wooden soapboxes to strike up dialogue with the passing public on their cutting-edge scientific work. Participating scientists will benefit from training in innovative methods in science communication, and opportunities for them to collaborate with established artists and art students while developing strategies to engage their audience. The project will also help promote the visibility of these scientists who are active in UK-based STFC-related research in traditional and non traditional media outlets, boosting their profiles and careers. Importantly, the proposed activities will provide opportunities for a diverse pool of children in the audience to engage with scientific concepts, develop an interest in research and show them how to break down the stereotypical thought that 'science and art don't mix'. Altogether, this will help make a real difference to the perception and role of science by the public.

The motive behind Soapbox Science is not entirely apolitical, and our aims are not limited to engaging the public with science: successful science outreach programs can help promote the emergence of role models that will spur on the young scientists of the future, while challenging stereotypes on who or what a scientist really is. It's no secret that there is a lack of
women in science-related careers, and the paucity of role models for female scientists is currently reinforcing the stereotype of science as the preserve of middle-aged bearded men in white coats. This project directly addresses this issue, by focusing its attention on women in science. Since 2011, Soapbox Science has grown from 1 to 12 annual events scheduled for 2016, achieving audiences of over 30k people in 2015 alone, and featuring over 200 female research scientists/academics across the UK. Soapbox Science is nationally cited alongside the Athena SWAN program as an effective approach for addressing gender gap in science careers, nominated among the top most innovate science outreach events in the EU (Horizon 2020) and as co-founders we were both given awards by the Prime Minister in June 2015 for our service to society through Soapbox Science (Points of Light Award). With this project, we thus aspire to strengthen our reputation as a leading international platform for actively promoting women in science, especially those conducting STFC-related research in which women are the worst represented (and least well retained) across the scientific community. Ultimately, we believe this can help inspire more girls to take on STEM subjects at A-levels and beyond, while pushing for the much-needed changes in the STEM culture to achieve the gear-shift in women's representation in science we need.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97910</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P00010X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>666CC8F4-4525-49AF-91C1-5675E0C8ADDF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chem.
