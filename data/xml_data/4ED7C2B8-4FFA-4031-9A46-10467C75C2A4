A stagnant level of 3.7M UK patients annually sees 30% of people discontinue lens wear with over 50% citing CLD, a trend
repeated globally. Advances in lens design and Oxygen permeability have not significantly improved CLD so the lens
surface is now considered the major factor in patient perception of comfort. Surface factors that can enhance comfort are
the reduction of both (i) the friction between the CL and ocular surfaces &amp;amp; (ii) levels of lipid &amp;amp; protein deposits. This project
will exploit a novel bio-inspired nanoscale surface engineered approach to create PEG (polyethylene glycol) surfaces with
self cleaning properties (Smart) to provide enhanced CL comfort eliminating the causal factors (i) and (ii) outlined above
The technology will be combined with existing materials and a new and innovative high efficiency CL manufacturing
method with substantial environmental benefits. CL wear provides a uniquely accessible site for demonstration of wider
biocompatibility behaviour with the findings allowing this technology to be exploited in other medical devices including
intraocular lenses (IOLs).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Those who will benefit from this research and how:
Patients who haven't tried contact lenses before, but who now decide to try the new lenses from consortium partner CLPL
because of their increased comfort and lower health risk, who will benefit such as through less optical effects (such as
magnification, binocular alignment, field of view restrictions and peripheral aberrations), myopia control (reduced rate of
progression by 3 to 8 times) and more natural cosmesis, with quantifiable benefits to their quality of life.
Patients who have tried lenses before and drop-out due to discomfort or who are currently wearing lenses and are likely to
suffer with discomfort as their tear film quality and quantity reduces as they age, but can now remain in CLPL lenses due to
the enhanced comfort afforded by the coating technology optimisation through this project.

Patients who have cataracts or have the crystalline lens within their eye replaced to correct their refractive error (usually as
their cornea is too thin for burning a lens profile with laser refractive surgery) will have the option of intraocular lenses from
consortium member Rayner that are less likely to cause secondary complications or more advanced designs that can
safely be implanted into their eyes.
Eye care practitioners will benefit indirectly from increased contact lens patient retention rates and a larger market share for
contact lenses to increase their service income.
The National Health Service will benefit from reduced eye care complications from contact lenses and complications
secondary to intraocular lens implantation from lenses that are more deposition and bacteria resistant, allowing more
efficient use of resources.
Patient benefits will bring and maintain ophthalmic medical device spending wealth in the UK as well as offering licencing
agreement finances to the consortium for the application of the technology to raw materials (GEO), ophthalmic materials
(Contamac), contact lenses (CLPL) and intraocular lenses (Rayner). This will increase the economic competitiveness of the
UK in the ophthalmic device field.
The University will also benefit from the dissemination outputs (peer reviewed publications and presentations) and
strengthening its working relationship with the UK supply chain, resulting in a shortening of the innovation to application
pathway.

The initial benefits of the research on contact lens comfort and ophthalmic medical device health are achievable within the
3 years of the project as the coating can be applied to existing consortium materials and products, simplifying the CE
marking process. The benefits will expand with the licencing of the technology for the mass market.
Regular meetings of the consortium will share knowledge and skills in team working, material science, research and
development, regulation of medical devices, clinical trials and marketing to the staff working on the project which are
transferable to all employment sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>249890</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Porcine anterior eye model including cornea and crystalline lens, perfused with media to keep biologically active for 8-10 days</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0DD7480-896E-4486-B6A6-CCD737770A7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ability to test non-CE marked ophthalmic medical devices without the use of animals (porcine eyes waste material from meat industry)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589463610f5214.21394422</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Porcine biological eye model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - in vitro</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N510075/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BD108981-2A72-4C45-AAC2-425461EB90BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomaterials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C89BB7D-DCEF-4DCF-84DB-CA53C907AB0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Surfaces &amp; Interfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
