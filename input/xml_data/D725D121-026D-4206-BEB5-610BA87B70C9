change requirements to enable flexible manufacturing and FRAMBE to become a viable, mainstream approach to
construction activity. It supports the technical and process development activities undertaken across the consortium.
Initially, it involves assessments of consortium and supply chain readiness in terms of implementing flexible manufacture
techniques, identification of potential social and cultural barriers to implementation and the development of strategies to
support this for the pilot projects (WP2 / objective 1). Following this, UoR will monitor and evaluate the pilots, focussing on
emerging cultural and working practice change requirements such as required skills, alignment of expectations and
integration of practices and process (WP 5 / objective 2). Post-pilot, the research activities will move to proposing new
business models and identifying change management steps to enable the necessary cultural change and work practice
reconfiguration to mainstream these new ways of working. These may include skills and capability identification, training
and mentoring arrangements, incentives and management systems, and leadership approaches to support cultural change
(WP 6 / objective 3).
UoR will also participate alongside BRE and the rest of the project consortium in the overall evaluation and dissemination
of the project's broader outputs to construction sector, policy and academic audiences as per the dissemination plan and
pathways to impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The University of Reading (UoR) will be part of a consortium of commercial construction supply chain partners. The wider
project will benefit construction suppliers (through better competitiveness) and clients (through reduced costs and risks) by
developing a flexible manufacturing production system to reduce construction costs, time, defects and waste. Benefits
discussed in this summary are limited to the UoR-specific research. Beneficiaries of the UoR research are: consortium
members; other UK construction industry actors (client and supply chain).
Consortium members will benefit directly from technology transfer of UoR's expertise in supporting technology
implementation, cultural change and change management in construction and there is a long-standing relationship between UoR and the rest of the consortium, not least through the TSB 'Modern Flying Factories' project. This benefit will be
realised concurrently with the development of FRAMBE as part of the project. Initial UoR analysis of readiness and barriers
to implementation for developing the pilot of the production system will create immediate benefit within the project as it is
used by consortium members to iteratively develop the system for further trials. UoR analysis will also be used by the
consortium as part of the dissemination activities of the wider project. There is an opportunity for significant impact given
the overall project's focus on smaller scale, repeatable construction solutions using advanced manufacturing technologies
and IT system integration.
UK construction industry actors outside the consortium will benefit from increased and improved use of flexible
manufacturing / FRAMBE for construction site operations. The potential benefits of these technologies are well established
but the difficulties of achieving and demonstrating their viability for flexible construction work application is seen a barrier to
industry-wide adoption. Through UoRs connectivity with actors involved with implementing this new policy both within the
Dept for Business, Innovation and Skills, and within the construction sector, will enable the integration of project outputs
into emerging policy implementation discussions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>63114</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BDF8A03E-3D4D-4E78-B46C-1AB5CFDFF553</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making the link between BIM's benefits and implementation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d851b39469708ab649031155bffb850d"><gtr:id>d851b39469708ab649031155bffb850d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dowsett, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c66993216085.03613837</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>46E2C6D2-16F7-4A66-83A7-CDCDADC3760F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing temporary manufacturing facilities for residential building: a case of the modern flying factory</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc20575abd28880b2272488592961703"><gtr:id>fc20575abd28880b2272488592961703</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Young, B.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c668f9433153.75849543</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N508925/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
