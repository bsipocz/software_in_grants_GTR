Although the technology to achieve this is
proven over dedicated point-to-point links, the full potential will only be realised with multi-user quantum networks.
Quantum relays offer a platform which can provide this, allowing quantum keys to be teleported across fibre-optic networks.
Commercial uptake requires practical entangled light sources operating within the optimum telecom wavelength band
around 1550 nm, and thanks to an established InnovateUK funded project, such sources are emerging for the first time.
Our vision is to construct and operate such a quantum relay, making practical quantum networks a realistic opportunity. By
combining the proven expertise and experience of the partners together with a challenging workplan, we will create an
improved generation of entangled photon-pair light sources engineered to interact with laser light. Epitaxial material will be
grown at the University of Sheffield and processed into a range of novel device structures at the University of Cambridge. A
prototype quantum relay will be delivered by TREL, which will leverage our unique entangled light sources, to teleport
quantum information encoded on laser beams, as demonstration of a practical quantum network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Exploitable outcomes will include IPR and technology related to single photon generation, growth of quantum dots and
fabrication of quantum devices. There is also the potential for IPR on the application of the device to areas such as
quantum key distribution, quantum relays/repeaters/networks, quantum sensors, quantum imaging and photonic quantum
computing.
We will seek to exploit the outcomes of the project through a close interaction with the EPSRC Quantum Technology Hubs,
especially those which have a strong focus upon photonic technologies and to which we can make a strong collaborative
contribution. In collaboration with the Quantum Communication Hub (co-ordinated by York) we will develop systems for
quantum relays/repeaters/networks and quantum digital signatures based upon fibre wavelength entangled LEDs
developed in this project. We will explore exploitation in schemes for eye-safe quantum enhanced LIDAR in the Quantum Imaging Hub (Glasgow).
Dissemination will be achieved through patent publications, scientific papers (eg recent reports by the applicants on
quantum light generation have been published in Nature, Nature Photonics, Nature Communications and Applied Physics
Letters) and presentations at relevant international conferences (such as Photonics West, ECOC, OFC, CLEO, CLEO
Europe, QCrypt, QCMC).
The know-how developed in the project will be added to the capabilities of the National Centre for III-V Technologies
andwill be available as a resource for the broader UK academic community through EPSRC, TSB or EU research grants.
This significantly increases the leverage of the project through dissemination into a broader set of R&amp;amp;D projects and other
applications areas such as telecommunication lasers and detectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101078</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R02216X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
