There are two types of UV rays; UVA and UVB. Previous research has focussed on UVB which has been thought to be the main cause of skin cancer. However, recent test-tube research suggests that UVA may also cause skin cancer. This is important not only because sunlight contains at least 20 times more UVA than UVB, and sunbeds give out large amounts of UVA, but because doctors use high doses of UVA in hospitals to treat some skin diseases. This study will find out whether the harmful effects of UVA seen in the test-tube really occur in humans by researching with healthy volunteers and patients being treated with UVA therapy. The study matters because, if UVA is harmful to skin, health advice to the public about sun protection will have to change to include UVA, and doctors may have to limit the amount of UVA treatment they can safely give to patients. The work will be done by specialists on the effects of UV rays on skin at St John?s Institute of Dermatology, London.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Although over 95% of ultraviolet radiation (UVR: wavelengths ~295-400nm) in sunlight is UVA (320-400nm), research has focussed on the smaller UVB (280-320nm) component because it has been thought to be the main cause of skin cancer. We plan to explore the health effects of UVAI radiation (340-400nm) in vivo in humans, in light of new in vitro evidence that UVAI may be more carcinogenic than previously thought.
 
In the skin, absorption of UVB from sunlight creates cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in DNA. Unrepaired CPDs induce UVB signature mutations (C?T and CC?TT), whose presence in skin cancers has been presumed as key evidence for the role of UVB in inducing skin cancer. CPDs are also important in skin inflammation, immunomodulation and photoageing. It has been thought that CPD only result from absorption of UV by DNA, which readily occurs with UVB and UVAII (320-340nm) but weakly with UVAI which exerts effects indirectly by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Unexpected recent in vitro data show that CPD are also induced by UVAI, by an unexplained mechanism. This implies that the UVAI component of sunlight may be more carcinogenic than previously thought. UVAI makes up 75% of the UVR in sunshine, almost all the radiation from sunbeds, and high dose UVAI phototherapy is being increasingly used to treat skin diseases. Thus, the safety of UVAI in human skin is a critical question in the effort to reduce the incidence of skin cancer.

We will determine the role of UVAI in the formation of CPD in humans in vivo. We will take skin biopsies after UVAI exposure (acute and repeated), from human volunteers and patients undergoing UVAI phototherapy. CPD repair kinetics will be examined by quantitative immunostaining and sensitive HPLC techniques. Downstream effects of CPD in UVAI-exposed skin will be assessed at the gene and gene product level, with mRNA analyses (DNA microarrays, PCR and in situ hybridization) and quantitative immunostaining. The fellow will learn laboratory and data analysis techniques in experimental photobiology, develop an understanding of environmental photobiology, and ethical issues in human research. The candidate will get a full training in clinical photodermatology and skin photobiology. The results of the project will allow the modification of public health strategies for skin cancer so that the appropriate component of solar radiation is protected against. They will also enable dermatologists to understand the long term safety of UVAI phototherapy and modify treatment protocols accordingly.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>226291</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newspapers(daily telegraph, daily mail), radio talkshows (Australian radio talk show), science magazine (Acta Eruditorum article)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:id>E8A3E46B-AABD-475B-94E5-5E091A400312</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article was released online in the JID in September 2011 along with a press release with comments from other academic experts talking about the results of the research (translational research where the carcinogenic effects of UVA1 radiation on human skin invivo was examined) and the importance in terms of sun lamps. We say that tanning lamps are likely to be carcinogenic.
There was a press release on the BRC/GSTT/Guys website and the article was also discussed in the daily telegraph and the daily mail.

We state with evidence that tanning lamps which emit primarily UVA1 radiation are carcinogenic and other forms of tanning (ie cream based products) should be encouraged. Although tanning lamps have been labelled as a class one carcinogen this has been based on invitro and mammalian research. We assess the carcinogenicity of UVA1 in humans in vivo.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>Bk63RAG8oCt</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>240000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BASF industrial studentship</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>BASF</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B2679B98-81C4-496C-8AA6-5C2064AFB327</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>g8NNeuqDMMg0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is a data analysis technique where by individual epidermal and dermal nuclei are identified and the computer is able to calculate the extent of DNA damage (CPDs) according to the intensity of immunofluorescene.
