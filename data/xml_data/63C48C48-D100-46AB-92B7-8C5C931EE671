TMDs are optimally designed (tuned) such that kinetic energy is transferred from the building (&amp;quot;primary structure&amp;quot;) to the TMD mass and dissipated by dampers. In general, larger TMD mass achieves better vibration suppression, but this is limited by architectural and structural (weight) constraints. Control of wind induced vibrations require TMD mass of 1%-5% of total building mass and this ratio can reach up to 15-20% or more for severe earthquake excitations.

The project:
-exploits the mass amplification effect of flywheel-based mass amplification devices (MADs) to achieve different apparent mass for the TMD+MAD configuration without changing the TMD weight; 
-explores the potential of energy harvesting from wind-induced building vibrations by containing the MAD's flywheel within a magnetic field such that rotational kinetic energy is transformed into electric energy;
-establishes a &amp;quot;pro-active&amp;quot; control paradigm within a multi-objective performance-based structural design framework: the apparent mass of the TMD+MAD changes through gearing according to pre-set &amp;quot;optimally&amp;quot; tuned values for different objectives such as optimal vibration suppression at serviceability state for user comfort- &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; apparent mass; maximization of energy harvesting during off-hours in office buildings- &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; apparent mass; minimisation of potential for structural damage at ultimate state {extreme wind fronts/downbursts or earthquakes}- &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; apparent mass). These changes can be &amp;quot;programmable&amp;quot; and informed by weather forecast and/or by early warning earthquake systems achieving &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot;/adaptive, energy efficient and resilient structures.

The proposed research idea is potentially transformative because it:
1)will allow for ever-more slender, taller, cost-effective, and aesthetically pleasing tall buildings in congested urban environments (e.g., London, Tokyo, NY, etc. where land use optimisation is essential) through the ability to control wind-induced (and/or earthquake) oscillations by more lightweight TMDs compared to the ones used today. These buildings will also be safer in more aggressive climate environments and with lower CO2 footprint through effective energy harvesting from large amplitude oscillations.
2)will change the &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; and functionality of building structures. Through the pro-active control framework, an office building can be designed to ensure absolute comfort to occupants during work hours even under future ever extreme climate change-induced winds for which
it has not been initially been built for. During off-hours the same structure becomes a flexible cantilever producing renewable energy from wind. 

The potential ultimate impact ot the project is:
-TECHNOLOGICAL: sparkling considerable new technological R&amp;amp;D and commercialisation opportunities for UK and international manufacturers of vibration suppression and energy harvesting equipment for civil and mechanical/automotive applications globally. SOCIETAL: enhancing infrastructure users' comfort, aesthetics, and structural safety and resiliency under future aggressive environments due to climate change. ECONOMICAL: stimulating the manufacturing sector, the construction industry, and the engineering consultancies towards world-class structures optimally designed for energy harvesting and vibration control; enhancing existing and future infrastructure value and economic life-cycle. ENVIRONMENTAL: reducing energy use and CO2 footprint of buildings through optimum wind energy harvesting, less material usage, and better land usage since more tall buildings can be built in a cost-effective manner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project develops (analytically and computationally) an innovative energy harvesting-enabled lightweight flywheel-based mass amplification mechanical device (inerter) and uses it to optimally design tuned mass-damper-inerter (TMDI) equipped tall structures following a novel pro-active control approach within a multi-objective performance-based framework. This new technology and structural design approach will:
1)allow for ever-more slender, taller, cost-effective, and aesthetically pleasing high-rise buildings in congested urban environments through the ability to control wind-induced (and/or earthquake) oscillations by more lightweight tuned mass dampers (TMDs) compared to the ones used today. These buildings will also be safer in more aggressive climate environments and with lower CO2 footprint through effective energy harvesting from large amplitude oscillations.
2)potentially transform the &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; and functionality of other civil engineering structures incorporating TMDs for vibration suppression such as (foot-) bridges, off-shore platforms, and wind turbines.
To this end, it is anticipated that, apart from the academic research community (being both a beneficiary and a short-term critical facilitator in achieving the anticipated economic and societal impact), the main beneficiaries of this research project will be:
a) in the short-term, (i) manufacturing companies/industry of vibration suppression/isolation and energy harvesting equipment for civil and mechanical/automotive applications. In particular, this project sparks considerable new technological R&amp;amp;D and commercialisation opportunities for such companies and manufacturers to address the world market needs for customized, lightweight, cost-effective electro-mechanical based vibration absorbers and energy harvesting devices. An expanding market for this device is foreseen as the World's needs for resilient and sustainable tall buildings in congested City centres of developed and developing countries increases together with wind-induced demands for new and existing structures due to climate change. (ii) Structural design offices, consultants, and practicing engineers undertaking analysis and design of tall structures.
b) in the mid-term, owners, asset managing agencies and maintenance contractors of tall buildings and of other civil infrastructure incorporating TMDs for vibration suppression such as (foot-) bridges, off-shore platforms, and wind turbines. The use of lightweight energy harvesting enabled TMDI systems will reduce the overall construction/erection cost of buildings yielding smart, resilient, and sustainable structures better equipped to face future climate change-related challenges. Thus, it will add value to structured assets by reducing insurance costs, enhancing occupants' comfort, and reducing structures' carbon footprint.
c) in the long-term, everyday users of civil engineering structures incorporating the TMDI technology and communities of major city centers and metropolitan areas.
Nevertheless, upon completion of the project, the following additional step is required to realise the aforementioned potential technological, economical, and societal impact to the above beneficiaries: to prototype/manufacture and to validate experimentally the new energy harvesting-enabled flywheel-based mass amplification device (inerter) to be developed in this project. This requires further multi-disciplinary experimental research undertaken by consortia of industrial partners and academic research groups of different fields (including full-scale hybrid testing and scaled-down wind tunnel and shaking table testing). To this end, focus will be given during the lifetime of this project to facilitate impact to the academic community and to the short term beneficiaries identified above which, in turn, will ensure that further experimental research will be conducted exploiting/applying, building on, and expanding the outcomes of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Notre Dame</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering &amp; Earth Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Application of the TMDI for seismic protection of Chilean buildings</gtr:description><gtr:id>77F391F7-8B1F-4AFF-95B2-8E5B4018F0D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ruiz R, Giaralis A, Taflanidis AA, Lopez-Garcia D.

The pursued configurations couple the widely-used for the considered purpose linear tuned mass-damper (TMD) with an inerter in various tuned mass-damper-inerter (TMDI) topologies. Note that the TMD is an additional free-to-oscillate mass attached towards the top of buildings via dampers and stiffeners or hangers and tuned to counterbalance the motion of the building, while the inerter is a two-terminal device resisting the relative acceleration of its terminals currently used in vehicle suspension systems. 
Moreover, this project explores the opportunity of generating energy from large amplitude low frequency oscillations of wind-excited tall buildings by considering a number of energy-harvesting enabled TMDI (EH-TMDI) topologies. The EH-TMDI involves the incorporation of an additional electromagnetic motor enabling the transformation of part of the kinetic energy of the attached TMDI mass to electric energy which can be stored for further use.
Focusing on vibration suppression in wind-excited tall/slender buildings, it is found through numerical/computational work involving benchmark 300m tall building structures equipped with TMDs and TMDIs of various properties and configurations that:
1) The incorporation of the inerter to the TMD is rather beneficial in reducing floor accelerations up to 30% or more for the same attached mass. Therefore, it is found that inerter devices can be readily used to upgrade the performance of existing TMD-equipped tall buildings in terms of floor accelerations. The latter is the most critical criterion to ensure occupants' comfort in high-rise building which dominates the design of such structures.
2) The TMDI achieves the same performance as the TMD using significantly smaller attached mass up to 10 times. It therefore enables lighter construction leading to more sustainable and cost-effective new tall buildings. 
3) The TMDI reduces significantly the attached mass displacement compared to the TMD and, therefore, the required space/clearance to accommodate the attached mass.
Turning the attention to the use of the TMDI for the seismic protection of buildings, it is found that the inclusion of the inerter is more beneficial when added to TMDs with relatively small attached mass (less than 2% of the total building mass), while the TMDI is more robust to uncertainties to the host structure properties and to the seismic excitation attributes than the TMD. 
Finally, an EH-TMDI topology has been defined amenable to robust multi-objective optimization for simultaneous vibration and energy is harvesting. 
The project is currently on-going and further key findings are expected to be reached later in 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The TMDI along with other types of inerter-based vibration suppression device assemblies has already been studied and used by several International research groups in the fields of structural dynamics and vibration control making an impact to the academic community. They focus on exploring its potential for the seismic protection of civil engineering structures as well as in vibration control in various mechanical engineering applications. It is foreseen that in the short-term the TMDI will be taken forward by (i) manufacturing companies/industry of vibration suppression/isolation and energy harvesting equipment for civil and mechanical/automotive applications, and (ii) Structural design offices, consultants, and practicing engineers undertaking analysis and design of tall buildings and of other civil infrastructure
