From January 1993 to December 2013 the IAEA report 2477 incidents. Their conclusions include that material is available and that globally individuals and groups are prepared to engage in trafficking. Understandably, Nuclear security, in particular against terrorist attack, continues to be high priority to the UK's government. The national risk register of civil emergencies, published by the Cabinet Office says:

&amp;quot;The Government is prioritising efforts to stop terrorists gaining the capabilities to deliver such {chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear} attacks. But if terrorist groups were successful, their potential impact on the UK would be severe and significantly greater than a conventional attack. &amp;quot;

The national counter terrorism strategy CONTEST therefore says:

&amp;quot;...their impact is so high that we judge preparations must be made for them. As in so many other areas of this strategy those preparations must wherever possible be coordinated with our allies overseas. &amp;quot;

Much of those preparations require technological developments in Nuclear Security Science. This subject is multidisciplinary and critically dependent on end-user engagement to be effective. This network will be the mechanism that associates the broad spectrum of disciplines that could possibly contribute, with the end users (UK and international) who can articulate the requirements.

The scope of the network will be focussed on radiation detectors and detection techniques applied to nuclear security applications, which lies within the STFC Global Challenges 'security' theme of the network call. A key objective will be to encourage dialogue and collaboration between academic researcher, primarily but not limited to the STFC community, and stake holders in industry and government agencies. In addition the network will provide a point of focus for the UK community to better position themselves for future bids to major sources of funding both nationally (eg, STFC, other research councils, Innovate UK) and internationally principally through EU and US programmes. 

A broad range of industrial, defence and academic partners are vital to the success of the network. The UK has traditionally had a very strong representation in detector development within the academic community, but this has tended to focus on large-scale national science priorities principally funded through STFC. Therefore this network will provide a strong forum for the research community to engage with end-users in industry and the defence sectors, and to allow these stakeholders to engage the academic community in their application challenges. 

We have already engaged with a broad range of industrial, defence and academic partners, which are vital to the success of the network. Letters of support are attached from Dr Bryan Wells, MoD Head of Science and Technology, Ian Gibson Deputy Director of CBRNE at OCST, and Professor Andrew Randewich AWE Chief Scientist.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Maximising impact is at the heart of the NuSec network, through the use of a range of funded impact activities that lie at the heart of the network's objectives. The broad range of network activities is described in the Case for Support and the benefits to the academic researchers are summarised in the Je-S form. Here we describe the wider impact that the NuSec network will achieve. 

1. The Beneficiaries
(i) Society - the nuclear security agenda is critical to national safeguarding and to the protection of society. A strong engagement between government agencies, academic and industry will realise a benefit for all of society. 
(ii) Economy - the possible economic loss to the country from a high impact terrorist activity is potentially catastrophic. This programme directly addresses the government's CONTEST counter-terrorism strategy to protect the nation from this type of very serious incident. 
(iii) People and Knowledge - through the cross-fertilisation of technical expertise between research disciplines and the integration of the various stakeholder communities, and by providing opportunities to benefit researchers and to develop the UK skills base in nuclear security.


2. How the Network Activities will deliver Impact 
The network will deliver impact directly through its programme of regular and occasional activities. 

Developing Strategic Partnerships: The network's primary objective is to establish a forum for discussion and collaboration between the academic, industrial and defence sectors. This will focus and accelerate the development of a strong research community in the nuclear science area, and will specifically broker interaction and partnership between the academic and MoD/Home Office communities. Our strategic partners each offer a unique input into the programme and will be fully involved with the regular network meetings and technical workshops. Both the network's Management Group (MG) and End User Panel (EUP) are made up of key stakeholders who will monitor the network's progress towards developing strategic partnerships. The independent Steering Board, representing the interests of the stakeholder groups, will ensure the development of partnerships through these various activities. 

Technology Development: The network will receive direct funding from the Home Office to support pilot studies and small proof of concept studies. These will be challenge-led projects that will be focussed on the requirements of these government agency stakeholders. In this way the network will effectively develop technology demonstrators that match the needs of the end user community. 

Dissemination activities: All network outputs will be unclassified, and the majority will be publicly available and openly disseminated, including technical workshop presentations, results from pilot studies, scoping documents and position papers. Dissemination will use a dedicated website to promote the network activities and outputs, and the University's Surrey Research Insight digital open access repository to store and disseminate network outputs and documents. The mid-term and final network conferences will also showcase the network outputs to a wider audience.

Influencing Policy: Outputs from the network will include positioning and policy papers, arising from the collaboration between scientific researchers and Home Office / MoD. Having these two stakeholder communities collaborating within the network will provide a strong route to influence policy in government. The network will support staff secondments between all stakeholders, and this will provide opportunities for enhanced engagement and policy influence with government agencies and other parties.

Supporting Researcher Engagement: The network will provide a series of opportunities for researchers to develop their technical skills and knowledge.
