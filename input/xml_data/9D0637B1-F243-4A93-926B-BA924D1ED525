There is growing interest in the idea of philosophy as a way of life that we can practice to live happier and more flourishing lives. But can philosophy really bring people together and create communities, or is it more of a solitary activity? What communities has it created in the past? What forms do community philosophy groups take today? And how could this project encourage their growth? 

One of the main aims of the research review is to identify and bring together what research exists on community philosophy groups, in order to stimulate future research in this area. At the moment, academic research into community philosophy groups has not been brought together in a single scoping study, with the result that this dynamic area has not received sufficient academic attention. This would be the first comprehensive review of existing academic literature on philosophy groups, and would play a valuable role for future researchers.

The project would also have a practical component, and would act as a catalyst for the growth of the grassroots philosophy movement, strengthening ties between academics, think-tanks and philosophy groups; increasing academic and media awareness of philosophy groups; and setting up a new 'philosophy hub' website, with an interactive map to help people find their nearest philosophy group, and to help philosophy groups attract new members. 

Finally, the project would seek to increase the role of philosophy groups in the British government's 'national initiative on well-being', which at the moment is dominated by a social scientific and technocratic approach. The project would show how philosophy groups empower people to reason their way towards their own definitions of well-being and flourishing, rather than having definitions imposed upon them. Grassroots philosophy groups therefore have an important role to play in making the 'national initiative on well-being' more humanistic, participatory and democratic. The project's collaborative partners include organisations closely involved with the 'national initiative on well-being', including the RSA and the new economics foundation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project will benefit four main groups. 

Firstly, it will benefit philosophy groups, by focusing greater academic attention on their work, highlighting their different methodologies and localities, and bringing together research into the benefits such groups bring in terms of increased community participation, engagement, public reasoning and flourishing. The website for the project will enable philosophy groups to attract new members, build links with other philosophy groups around the UK and the world, and connect with academics and media interested in their work. And the seminar will help philosophy groups by giving them the chance to meet academics, journalists and other philosophy groups, to highlight their work, and to find out about other groups' methodologies. 

Secondly, the research project will benefit think-tanks, academics and policy-makers working on the new 'politics of well-being', by showing how the politics of well-being can be made more humanistic, democratic and participatory, rather than being dominated by a social scientific and technocratic approach. The project has already attracted interest from leading think-tanks working in well-being policy, including the RSA and the new economics foundation, both of which are collaborative partners. 

Thirdly, the research project will benefit academics working in other countries, who are interested in the politics of well-being in the UK and in their own countries. 

Finally, the project will benefit the general public, by setting up a website allowing them to find their nearest philosophy group, by providing video and text materials on how to set up and run their own philosophy group, and by increasing the exposure of such groups in the media and in academic research. The project will also show how philosophy groups can act as a bridge between academic philosophy departments and the wider public, and between think-tanks and the wider public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31860</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>See published report and Jules Evans researchfish submission</gtr:description><gtr:id>87D04079-91B4-4601-B4B6-1309EF27186E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5464b469b0a7e4.43021818</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>See published report and Jules Evans researchfish submission</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See published report and Jules Evans researchfish submission</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7C981E45-955D-4D97-8C56-F2A52E65BEE3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464b4b04c2984.30240460</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D65CC974-4EC0-4014-B416-2AD52613D092</gtr:id><gtr:title>Connected Communities: Philosophical Communities A report for the Arts and Humanities Research Council, by Jules Evans, policy director of the Centre for the History of the Emotions, at Queen Mary, University of London November 2012</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9b5cd0ada3fd14d4c0642eb5c0d3eaf6"><gtr:id>9b5cd0ada3fd14d4c0642eb5c0d3eaf6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464b36e0738b0.31080604</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J012262/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
