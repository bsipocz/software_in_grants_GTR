Some sectors such as air travel and shipping will struggle to meet this target, while other sectors such as the built environment will have to move to a position of carbon neutrality at least which currently contribute just under half of the UK's carbon emissions. To address this problem the government have developed a mechanism to reach the overall target with new domestic properties and schools becoming zero carbon by 2016, all other new public sector buildings by 2018 and all other buildings by 2019. 
It is clear that a warming climate will increase the overheating risk in the built environment where traditionally this would lead to increased air conditioning use and add to energy consumption. Predicted summertime temperature increases can be expected to lead to higher mortality rates among vulnerable groups in poorly adapted buildings; increasing the burden on the emergency services. 
This fellowship aims to create an early stage design tool to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality within buildings as the climate warms. The proposed tool will use the most recent climate predictions, a proven thermal model of a building and new models of human thermo-regulation among those most susceptible to heat stress. 
The research will be carried out over four phases. Firstly, the maximum level of input tolerated by the end user, in this case architects, will be captured. The maximum number of key strokes tolerated and the complexity of the technical concepts are most likely to be limiting factors. The second phase will involve the production of a simple dynamic thermal model which will predict the internal environment for a range of constructions, weather patterns and climates. The third phase will develop a new human thermo-regulatory model which can be incorporated into a thermal model of a building with time varying internal environments. The fourth phase will extend the model to areas where building regulations do not traditionally require thermal modelling and climate change will have the greatest impact. 
Traditional thermal models usually require an accurate description of the building's geometry and construction which is not generally available until the latter stages of development. Such models are generally used to demonstrate compliance with building regulations only. Hence there is a need to produce a tool which is able to consider both the mitigation and adaptation agenda and most importantly heat stress in humans at an early stage in the design process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this work are wide ranging, and will include other academics within the scientific community, the building industry, any business involved in building design, the Government and policy makers on a regional and national scale. These include local authorities and Government departments including the Dept. for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), Dept. for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), Dept. Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). In the longer term the general public will benefit from the scientific and technical advances made during the study. 

This work will have significant societal and economical impacts. The UK Government has set challenging targets for improving sustainability and limiting anthropogenic climate change, starting with the goal of achieving an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) in the UK by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. About 45% of the UK's CO2 emissions come from buildings. As a result of this the government has set a series of targets to make all new domestic, public and private sector buildings zero-carbon by 2019. Legislation will be needed to ensure buildings are robustly designed to meet these targets. The proposed research is therefore highly relevant to this agenda as it will help to inform policy makers, engineers and building designers to achieve the required carbon savings in a cost effective methodological manner. There is typically a significant discrepancy between the predicted energy performance of a building (and hence its CO2 emissions) and the measured performance. These from a variety of sources, ranging from the design and modelling tools used in the design of the building, through to the build process and the comfort and motivation of occupants. This project will help builders and developers to understand how their buildings perform and why, and help the sector as a whole deliver more efficient, better performing buildings. 

Current climate change estimates predict that changes in temperature could be large enough to cause severe discomfort and have detrimental effects on human health around the world. The heat wave of 2003 showed that severe overheating of buildings has drastic consequences for human health. The proposed research will therefore also indirectly benefit the general public, by incorporating a human thermal regulation model into the building design process. This can be used to reduce morbidity and mortality of the vulnerable (e.g. elderly), and improve the quality of life of the people using buildings designed for a changing climate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>506057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have been used to develop new weather years for the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) for the use of building simulation, compliance and overheating assessments.
