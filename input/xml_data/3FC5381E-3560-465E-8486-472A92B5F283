Some of the deepest results in quantum mechanics have been revealed within the framework of quantum optics, and it is also here that some of the most promising quantum-technology applications, such as quantum communication and cryptography, are being developed.

Workers in solid-state physics have long dreamt of performing their own version of quantum optics in which photons of light are replaced by electrons in a semiconductor. The ultimate goal is to understand and to be able to manipulate the quantum, wave-like properties of the electron, at the same level as we do for photons. From a technological point of view, this is important because electronic components keep getting smaller and, for this to continue, quantum effects will have to be taken into account. Moreover, by harnessing quantum effects we open the doors for new quantum technologies and, from the point of view of integration with conventional technology, semiconductors are ideal for this.

Experimentalists have succeeded in realising a number of nano-electronic circuits that emulate key photonic-quantum-optics experiments, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, that show the wave-like properties of electrons. Whilst these experiments clearly demonstrate the analogy between electron and photon optics, significant differences emerge, most notably because electrons interact with one another whereas photons do not, and because of background electrons that are always present in semiconductors. Unfortunately, in a process known as decoherence, interactions between electrons tend to erase the very signatures of quantum mechanics that we are interested in. This limits the size and complexity of the electron quantum optics set-ups that we can usefully construct.

We believe that recent experiments on quantum-dot charge pumps suggest a way round this problem, and it is the aim of this project to investigate this possibility. 

Charge pumps inject electrons one-by-one into the semiconductor. These electrons are then confined by a magnetic field in so-called edge-channels, which act as one-dimensional ``wires'' that carry the electrons around the circuit. The energy of the electrons emitted by the quantum-dot charge pumps we are interested in is particularly high, and this tends to push the electrons out into the edges of the semiconductor and away from the background electrons. This effect can be further enhanced by adding electrical contacts near the edges. The result is that these ''hot'', i.e. high-energy, electrons become well isolated in the edges, well away from all other electrons. This situation then closely resembles the naturally-isolated nature of photons and this, we hypothesise, will drastically reduce the problem of decoherence. 

The limits on quantum effects for these hot electrons will therefore not be set by electron-electron interactions, but rather by different mechanisms. In this project we will investigate these mechanisms, isolate the important ones, and devise ways to minimise their negative effects. We will also develop software to simulate realistic hot-electron quantum-optics geometries which will give a detailed understanding of the dynamics of hot electrons in experimentally-relevant devices.

This work will be conducted in close collaboration with the experimental group of M. Kataoka at the National Physical Laboratory, who are experts in the construction and measurement of charge-pump sources. In this way we shall advance the field of electron quantum optics both theoretically and experimentally, and have impact on the most-promising application of these pumps, that as a reference for high-precision electrical measurements.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will have impact over a range of time-scales. 

In the short term, the main impact will be on, and through, metrology, the science of measurement. A key component in HEQO is the single-electron source. These are being developed at the UKs Quantum Metrology Institute and at national laboratories around the world, as a new way of defining the SI base unit of current, the ampere. Electrical units such the ampere play a vital role in modern society where electrical measurements underpin most technological, industrial and economic activities. A current standard based on single-electron sources holds promise to be more accurate, more reliable and more easily reproducible than present-day methods.

Our proposal will have impact on the development on these current sources by providing a detailed theoretical understanding of the behaviour of the electrons emitted by them. Through studying the interference effects that lie at the heart of HEQO experiments, we obtain new information about the quantum properties of emitted electrons, and thus about the emission processes itself. This information can then be used to help make the improvements required to make charge pumps viable current standards. This impact will be brought about through our collaboration with project partner M. Kataoka, who is a part of the Quantum Metrology Institute at the National Physical Laboratory.

On a longer time frame, we expect our work to have impact on the Quantum Technology effort now being vigorously pursued in the UK. Other things being equal, semiconductors would be the ideal arena for quantum technology, due to ease of integration with conventional electronics. Just as single-photon quantum optics was a precursor for serious developments in quantum technology in optics, we expect HEQO to play a similar stepping-stone role for quantum technology in the semiconductors.

Our proposal looks at two important aspects relevant to this endeavour. We will explicitly consider hot edge-channel electron as being long-distance carriers of quantum information, or ''flying qubits''. These flying qubits might form the basis for semiconductor quantum information processing themselves, or they might act as a quantum bus, transferring information between other solid-state quantum systems. We will investigate how to realise the building-block operations of quantum information processing using interferometric geometries. A large part of this project is dedicated to understanding decoherence in HEQO. Over very short time-scales, quantum particles such as electrons lose their ability to act quantum-mechanically and thus to perform the quantum-technology functions that rely on this. This decoherence is the limiting factor when it comes to constructing quantum-technology devices, and learning how to minimise it is thus of vital import. In this project we conduct a broad study of decoherence mechanisms for hot electrons. This is important for the success of HEQO, but will also have general relevance for solid-state quantum technology schemes.

Further economic impact will be made through the training of a post-doctoral researcher, a PhD student, and an undergraduate summer student. These individuals will gain expertise across physics, mathematics and computational techniques, develop their communication skills, and network with leading researchers. The research associate will gain research management skills through working with the two students. The PhD will gain similarly through their responsibility for the undergraduate student. Meanwhile, the undergraduate will gain an invaluable first taste of high-level research. The close collaboration of this project with experiment will also mean that the individuals will develop as theorists capable of interfacing with real-world data and practical constraints.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252480</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P034012/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9CD2DA3B-F052-4076-95ED-10F46E76C382</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optics, photonics &amp; lasers</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A2FF150-B3DF-4C8F-A44C-1EBF60BAFC60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Condensed Matter Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>22E04520-28AA-48BA-9263-1CFE1B162D16</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Quantum Optics &amp; Information</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
