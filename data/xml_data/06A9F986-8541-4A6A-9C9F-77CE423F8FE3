The cast of the play were Peterborough young people, supplemented by two London-based professional actors. Production management were by Peterborough residents Keely Mills and Jabeen Shafee. Many more Peterborough residents were involved in stage management, in publicity, in the community-based auditions, and as audiences in the four performances in a diverse range of community locations. For full details see http://placesforall.co.uk/theatre/



The workshops and auditions involved students from Ormiston Bushfield Academy, St John Fisher Catholic School, Peterborough Regional College and Thomas Deacon Academy. 



The play was covered in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and in the Polish language regional newspaper Nasze Strony. See http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/local/latest-local-news/performances-tell-stories-of-peterborough-s-people-1-4021035

and http://naszestrony.co.uk/wschodnia-anglia/peterborough/2769-p-borough-fair-s-not-fair-foto.html



Audiences: St Paul's Church (53); Peterborough United Football Club (40); Gladstone Park (68); Green Backyard (42).



Research project advisor Rehana Ahmed on the Gladstone Park performance:

'I was really impressed by the audience you managed to attract, especially considering how hard this always is. I was especially struck by how successful you were in this respect. You also clearly managed to attract members of the Pakistani community who - I would imagine - are not regular theatre-goers. I'm sure this was in part because of your chosen venue (and think your choice of venues is inspired). The atmosphere afterwards was great, with audience and actors mingling - and in the context of the amazing photographs.'</gtr:description><gtr:id>B602EFC3-C71A-46AB-BC36-8AEBFBD466E2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5214082426.5909210ad05d88</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Play: Fair's (Not) Fair!</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In 'In Passing' (9' 31&amp;quot;) young people Dan, Charlie, Izak, and Kelly discuss the Foyer, their temporary home, and acknowledge a complex web of relations embedded in their understanding of place, at once known and familiar, but also imagined.

It was shown on TV on the Community Channel on 29th September 2012. The short films were uploaded 1286 times between 25 January and 2 March 2012. Some Kind of Life is the result of working with people in Peterborough (UK) who have been, or still are, homeless. The films explore,through personal narratives, a constellation of issues implicated in being 'on the street'. The shorter films act as individual portraits, while the longer film draws upon these to articulate a more complex narrative.



The stories we are told offer brief glimpses, often nothing more. Sometimes there is only one opportunity to talk, maybe a second one, rarely more than that. Arrangements are made and changed and rearranged and then cancelled; people's lives are often chaotic. On occasion we are offered an invitation into a person's lifeworld. We listen to their stories, attempting to tease out the narrative threads of their lives. The stories tell of the spaces they inhabit and from which they draw their sense of self, and how they acknowledge a complex web of relations embedded in their notion of place, at once known and familiar, but also imagined and memorialised.



Some Kind of Life challenges assumptions about what constitutes home and how people understand their own sense of belonging.</gtr:description><gtr:id>27FD44AF-CE32-45D4-8B84-59081200F567</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8379245557.2441640ad059f0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Film: Some Kind of Life</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This website has been designed to make publicly available many of the key project outputs including the combined photography and oral history work, films made with homeless people and with young people in supported housing, a film of the theatre project, and links to collaborators and to pdf copies of presentations made during the life of the Fellowship.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0AB6E65E-0E77-45AE-A9E0-4D813F835412</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6322646119.0009920ad05ef0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Places for All?

The project also had eighteen oral history interviews transcribed that were recorded with Peterborough residents as part of the Millennium Memory Bank project and are stored at the British Library in London.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BC439CD2-276E-4B7F-987C-436974CC7A43</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4263910301.27546740ad05464</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Oral history transcripts (53) deposited at Peterborough Local Studies and Archives, Peterborough Central Library</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This five minute film records the final community event of the project on November 24th 2012 when over sixty research participants attended a tea party and photographic exhibition at Chauffeurs Cottage, Peterborough.

This was co-produced research and was in various ways transformational for both participants and researchers. Evidence for this has been written up in the forthcoming Sociological Review paper 'Don't show the play at the football ground: the micro-sociality of co-produced research in an English provincial city' referenced in the publication portfolio, currently in press and due to be published in 2016. Additionally the research led to impacts on approaches to the arts in the English city of Peterborough, in particular on ways in which established arts organisations in the city engaged with people who had not previously tended to be part of (or engaged with by) such organisations. Further, the research process led to an increased awareness of potential commonalities around employment relations and working conditions in the city region across artificial divides along ethno-national lines, especially in the food production, processing and packing sector. Learning from the project has also fed into a number of further AHRC-led Research Councils Connected Communities grants, all under the call for proposals on Addressing the Challenges of Disconnection, Division and Exclusion (Creative Interruptions: grassroots culture, state structures and disconnection as a space for 'radical openness', large research grant led by Brunel University, funding approved subject to conditions; The Un-Sociable Bench, and other urban micro-territories of encounter and intimidation, research grant led by the University of Sheffield; and three project development grants). Finally the deposit of 54 life history transcripts in the Peterborough Local Archives service has begun to be drawn on as a way of learning about migration, work and belonging in the city and beyond.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>40C11A2F-811E-4A28-B349-B9F95694E808</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a9d2416df8.97782287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Places for All? is a more-than-academic collaborative project with strong community engagement. It developed through the grounded presence of researchers, strong relations built with oral history participants, and the use of multiple media, including photography, film, theatre and writing. 



The project was designed in a response to a call for proposals issued by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council - led Research Councils Connected Communities Programme - in collaboration with the Royal Society of Arts' Citizen Power Peterborough programme. The location of the research in the city of Peterborough, England, was thus determined by the call.



Critical of hegemonic discourses regarding immigration, citizenship and belonging that often construct international migrants and religious minorities as outsiders, the project raises questions about the appropriation of space in the name of the local and apparently 'indigenous'. Peterborough as a place is constantly in flux, and is made up of streets and neighbourhoods with their own shifting identities. The most major change in living memory was the arrival of Londoners and others from outside the city in the 1970s as the city's New Towns were constructed. They, like the many thousands of residents who were born abroad, maintain various kinds of connections with places elsewhere, some more intensely than others. It is the realisation that having trans-spatial connections is in itself something that both international migrants have in common both with internal migrants and people who have never lived away from the city that lies at the heart of the project's findings.



Furthermore, while home to significant engineering, publishing and financial services sectors Peterborough retains its rural connections, particularly to the agriculture and food production economy of the Fens region. It is not only a mainly working-class city, but also a rural one and a regional hub for food-sector workers. Cognizant of the historic importance of agency-working and the agrarian and food economies in the livelihoods of people in the city, the project thus links integration - including debates over housing and the use of public space - with capitalist employment relations that require workers who can be available at short notice and for undefined periods of work: often international migrants.



Places for All? is about transformation as well as investigation. Through working with grass roots community organisations such as the Peterborough Racial Equality Council, the Green Backyard, The Gladstone Park Recreation and Community Centre, Cromwell Road Mosque, St Paul's Church and Peterborough United Football Club, it brings into encounter the stories of people with a range of ethno-national backgrounds, including white English people. An important part of the project's story is the enabling of new relations, of mutual regard and respect. In collaboration with local worker-artists, it challenged the unspoken assumption of some regional and national stakeholders that art was something that needed to be 'done to' the city, instead drawing attention to creative contributions being made by Peterborough residents themselves, including working-class people of all backgrounds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The films, photographs, stories and research papers found on the Places for All? website are suggestive of the potential for shared authority and co-production in multi-media oral history research. For example, films made with people who are or have recently ceased being street homeless, and with young people in sheltered housing, suggest ways of understanding cities that value multiple perspectives, including from residents for whom home is the road, or a hostel. The examples of holding a photographic/ life story exhibition at a car boot sale, or of rehearsing a play (based on oral history testimony) in a mosque and then performing it at the local football ground, a community growing project, a church and a mainly south Asian heritage community centre, can be used to push back against received wisdom that working-class people do not engage with the arts or are inevitably divided along ethno-national lines. This in turn be a resource for building greater mutual respect alongside a critical awareness of the kinds of employment relations and housing market dynamics that exacerbate exclusion and inequality.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>965DF484-65A2-47CC-A598-B66FB8A62967</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7788594558.6381447d659f3e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.placesforall.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CE6C43EB-BA45-4F95-9EFB-155F9005CCF1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disrupting migration stories: reading life histories through the lens of mobility and fixity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment and Planning D: Society and Space</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/80eb64b791a7671b9f6548a1a85474f8"><gtr:id>80eb64b791a7671b9f6548a1a85474f8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rogaly B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a13f831e36.88181479</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3DB95606-D38C-4A23-AE94-133F15B106F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Culture shock on Southall Broadway: re-thinking 'second generation' return through 'geographies of Punjabiness'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>South Asian Diaspora</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b53cea33e52fdca050d648edb337eb3f"><gtr:id>b53cea33e52fdca050d648edb337eb3f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kaveri Qureshi (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_1215655924034d1052</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F6194BD-CBD9-4B59-8526-EB05AAB88B19</gtr:id><gtr:title>Citizenship and its Others</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/80eb64b791a7671b9f6548a1a85474f8"><gtr:id>80eb64b791a7671b9f6548a1a85474f8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rogaly B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-349-55622-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a29494db13.84246486</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3035E960-BB80-4E91-8408-F38F37427178</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re: Development: Voices, Cyanotypes &amp;amp;
