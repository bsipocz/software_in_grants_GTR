An energy revolution must take place if the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided. Even without the impact this may have (eg through carbon pricing), fuel costs have a very uncertain future. GRIT has two aims:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>create a fine-grained picture of the current spatial structure of the UK economy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>consider how changing fuel prices could alter that structure over the long term.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>GRIT examines the web of connections between businesses in the UK to identify sectors and locations facing the greatest changes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>GRIT will work with a unique dataset: the Business Structure Database contains information for nearly every UK business, including location and sector classification. This will be linked to sectoral trade flow data. These two sources offer an opportunity to map the current spatial distribution of economic activity in the UK and to think about how that distribution may change in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>GRIT combines this data-driven approach with a plan to engage with organisations directly affected. GRIT will work closely with a small number of organisations and engage others through the project website.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?

The problem the project addresses is important to many stakeholders including government departments concerned with trade, the spatial economy, and climate change (BIS, DfT, DECC, CLG); UK business and trade bodies affected by uncertain fuel price futures; civil society groups involved in campaigning on climate change and 'peak oil' adaptation at the local level; and research organisation such as the UK Energy Research Centre.

We have established agreement to work with the Co-operative Group to examine the issues they face in planning for the risks posed by fuel cost changes (see letter of support), and to help the project understand the details faced by working organisations. The Co-operative is a large organisation; we will also collaborate with a business network, such as 'Deliciously Yorkshire' to work with small to medium size enterprises. The challenges facing smaller firms are likely to be unique; this work will be of great benefit to these enterprises.

The UK 'Transition movement' is predicated on taking action at the local level to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and energy issues. It has, in recent years, developed strong links with academic researchers. A vibrant knowledge exchange has developed between locally acting groups and many academic organisations. It has matured enough to start collecting data that aims to build on these exchanges to the mutual benefit of both, making sure that &amp;quot;transition and research form a symbiotic relationship&amp;quot; (Brangwyn 2012). We anticipate benefits through engaging with this group.

How will they benefit?

Short to medium term impact: This research is the first attempt to develop a detailed geo-spatial map of inter-UK trade flows, and how such flows may respond to fuel price changes. The impact of this research project in the short term is likely to be relatively modest, as much of the work is of a proof of concept nature, demonstrating how the secondary data can be synthesised to produce potential benefit for a diverse range of stakeholders (outlined above). Lasting impact depends upon third party application of the results derived (this could be expected to occur for the case study partner, who would benefit from the intelligence provided which will inform their future strategic retailing plans).
 
Continuing impact: The real impact of the research is likely to be realised over the longer term, and could be profound. As fuel prices change, and the economy is subject to geo-spatial stress on trade flows, we will see changes in transport and distribution. Thus the research provides a basis for understanding how fuel price changes impact upon issues such as freight distribution, and associated carbon emission - such intelligence is vital to understanding the impacts of fuel pricing on carbon emission, in the context of national carbon reduction commitments.

Where fuel price pressures on trade flows are high, there are likely to be changes in the rate and location of different types of economic activity. Our research could provide new insights into the spatial distribution of economic activity across the UK in future. This would inform strategic appraisal across a range of domains: for example, we can envisage working with the water industry (where we have very strong links - see www.wateratleeds.org) to explore how spatial restructuring changes future spatial patterns of non-domestic water demand. The geo-spatial intelligence produced would be valuable in informing infrastructure development needs for other utilities, and via production implications for employment, has implications for the spatial location of demands for housing and social services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>123824</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Geospatial Restructuring of Industrial Trade (GRIT)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2D96F0B3-C62B-4CEE-999C-451372239A57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to the GISRUK Conference (April 2013).

This research presents a model of these tensions for the UK, looking at industrial sectors and places that may face the biggest impact from increasing distance costs.
Understanding the immutably spatial nature of the economy will be central in navigating a route to a zero-carbon future. In the next few decades, the UK must (along with other countries globally) transition its economy away from carbon sources to avoid the most serious risks posed by climate change. This research aims to clearly show the importance of distance in this transition.
The first step is to estimate the UK's spatial pattern of trade flows, thus overcoming the lack of detailed spatial economic data. The 'Business Structure Database' contains spatial records for nearly all UK businesses (covering around 99% of total turnover) but says nothing about trade flows between them. Trade flow data between sectors is available in input-output matrix form - but this has no spatial information. These two are linked to produce an estimate of intra-UK spatial trade flows.
The second step is to model, for a range of plausible values, how patterns of trade may change as distance costs alter. The aim is to diagnose the most at-risk features of the UK's spatial economy while avoiding the need to precisely predict future trade flow scenarios. Fundamental to this step is the use of a parameter-sweep approach (see e.g. Wibisono et al. 2008). By comparing demand change between each of a range of distance cost steps, parameter-sweeping is used to take x-rays of economic structure that would otherwise be opaque. Using this approach, consistent patterns can be discerned in the way places and industrial sectors are affected. This research will allow researchers and practitioners to investigate changes that may occur within these systems both spatially and temporally under a set of specific research questions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The methods can be used for applications with a simular focus.

The process of developing GRIT's methodology has led to a number of technical innovations. The central method of GRIT is itself a methodolical innovation. The approach of combining non-spatial trade flow input-output data with spatial information from the BSD has been shown to produce effective results.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B457BE48-7D83-45D1-9672-5431BC01F4C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of GRIT's key aims has been to examine the impact of fuel cost changes on the industrial structure of the UK. Rather than concentrating on specific fuel cost changes, a novel method has been developed that shows per-sector and per-zone change is relatively stable at a range of plausible changes in distance cost values, calibrated around known goods flows from Department for Transport data. This method of parameter-sweeping around real-world distance data is a novel way of dealing with otherwise extremely difficult calibration issues to produce useful results and signpost the most promising research paths.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54576cd2dafdc3.76488091</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>GRIT Model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data handling &amp; control</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>40685469-C028-4162-A73A-DC7C96FF3158</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Geospatial Restructuring of Industrial Trade': modelling the impact of distance cost change on the UK's spatial economic structure</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/993357bfe24dda7a6294a2ed6d92f5c5"><gtr:id>993357bfe24dda7a6294a2ed6d92f5c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Olner D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d9bded6fff33.55020258</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1977F465-302E-4C45-B429-23FD2036E024</gtr:id><gtr:title>An agent model of urban economics: Digging into emergence</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computers, Environment and Urban Systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0f6084b7408c7b034c5ee51bf89a1c9d"><gtr:id>0f6084b7408c7b034c5ee51bf89a1c9d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Olner D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5457727f71a4c1.63052446</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8C2415E5-5153-483A-8668-CAB69AF274E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simulating Spatial Dynamics and Processes in a Retail Gasoline Market: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions in GIS</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8d9913fa1c260645d5313763e7a22478"><gtr:id>8d9913fa1c260645d5313763e7a22478</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Heppenstall A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5457680b2be8c6.78037745</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>45DE6093-CA36-4038-B546-3B9E1147FCD1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Geospatial Restructuring of Industrial Trade': modelling the impact of distance cost change on the UK's spatial economic structure</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Economic Geography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/807939b00f574db56f06c05d9b5f7dda"><gtr:id>807939b00f574db56f06c05d9b5f7dda</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Olner, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>545c95cdb3e072.26543578</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K004409/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>748617DE-4AB0-42C9-9514-B22ECFBE05E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transport Ops &amp; Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
