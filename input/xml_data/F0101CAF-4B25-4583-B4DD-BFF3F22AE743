The application of 21st Century technology to unpicking the disjointed sentences that comprise the fossil record is now permitting scientists to reconstruct past worlds in higher fidelity. This new and exciting area of research is currently being explored by Dr. Phil Manning, from the School of Earth, Atmospheric &amp;amp; Environmental Science at the University of Manchester.

Phil's 'Bright Lights and Dinosaurs' project aims to use his research on synchrotron-based imaging and XRT of past life in order to help explain the methods and technologies used to study samples ranging from microbes to dinosaurs. Bright Lights and Dinosaurs aims to show how chemistry can define the origins, synthesis, function, and subsequent alterations/modifications of ancient molecules. The molecules that Phil and his team track down come from some of the most iconic species to have walked, swam, crawled, slithered, slimed, flown, or jumped on Earth. Phil likes nothing more than talking about his science or dragging the odd dinosaur bone out to schools, colleges, shopping centres or village fetes!</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>120178</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Diamond Light Source</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Diamond</gtr:department><gtr:description>Bight Lights and Dinosaurs outreach</gtr:description><gtr:id>9486364D-F91F-4D74-85FA-5BBF2C632681</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2013:

Also, the collaboration has resulted in a significant number of beam time shifts granted to my team over the next 3 years (worth around $400k in beam time).

At both SSRL and Diamond we investigate the preservation of compounds that can be linked to endogenous soft-tissues, their breakdown products or affiliated elemental inventories. This allows the identification of the rate law dependencies for soft-tissue breakdown reactions under various lithological conditions and thus isolates the conditions that may lead to exceptional preservation in deep time. We propose that the presence of specific trace-metal inventories may act to aid the preservation of soft-tissue fossils, and thus a key stream of research for the group is to investigate how the presence of specific elements and compounds affects the fossilisation process. We also seek to extend our current database to cover the preservation and detection of discrete soft-tissue biomarkers, since this will improve our ability to resolve further aspects of biochemistry and possibly physiology. We have named this particular research direction, the 'palaeometallome'. This research takes full advantage of the high sensitivity, but decimetre scale elemental mapping capability, that the Synchrotron Rapid Scanning X-Ray Fluorescence (SRS-XRF) technique provides at SSRL, as well as using micro EXAFS at Diamond. 

Our research focus has fallen upon the colour patterns preserved in ancient organisms, which is an important factor in an organism's biology and natural selection. For example, colouration is known to indicate sexual dimorphism and can even indicate the habitat in which an organism resides. Our recent contributions to this area of research have uniquely employed synchrotron x-ray techniques to study several fossil and extant organisms including reptile skin (50 Million year age [Mya]) and feathers in the pivotal early bird Confuciusornis sanctus (~120 Mya) and the iconic Archaeopteryx lithographica (~150 Mya), in order to map and characterize the preserved chemical residues of melanin pigments (responsible for dark black/brown and reddish hues). A number of biologically important metal ions (such as Ca2+, Cu2+, Co2+, and Zn2+) are chelated by and affect the chemical properties of melanin so that trace metal distributions help constrain the location and concentration of melanin in extant feathers. Supported by many other analytical techniques, synchrotron results show that trace metals such as copper are present in fossil soft-tissues as organometallic compounds most likely derived from original eumelanin pigment (the type of melanin responsible for dark black/brown colouration). EXAFS analyses indicated that the Cu-coordination chemistry in the fossils is predominantly an organic molecular compound with coordination chemistry similar to Cu in natural eumelanin. The planar atoms of the C. sanctus Cu-coordination complex superimposed onto a recently optimized computational model of melanin confirm this result. The distribution of these compounds provides a long-lived biomarker of eumelanin presence and density within a range of extinct organisms.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>591cc189790861.99166708-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Diamond provided a step-change in imaging technology to build-upon existing facilities at SSRL.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We recently upgraded the beam line 6-2 at SSRL, using technology built and developed at Diamond Lightsource for the Rapid Scanning X-Ray Fluorescence set-up.

The series traces key moments in the history of life on Earth while showing a side of science that few people ever experience. Unfolding in some of the most remote locations in the world, the series shows how the lessons of the ancient past are vitally important to understanding the present. Never before has an understanding of past life-and its extinction-had such urgent implications for humanity's present challenges, and never before has there been such a pressing need for responsible science programming that makes these ideas tangible to a mass audience. Phil and his team are at the leading edge of a new interdisciplinary approach that merges biomechanics and molecular biology with new imaging techniques to create the clearest picture we've ever had of dinosaurs and other past life on Earth. His implementation of new technology has produced innovative theories about dinosaur growth and behavior, solved long-standing scientific debates, and contributed to current climate science.
