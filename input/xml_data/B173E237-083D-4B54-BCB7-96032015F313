The aim is to see if PRP improves healing. PRP is a highly concentrated platelet extract from a small sample of a participants own blood; these platelets carry hundreds of proteins that encourage healing. Treatment can be given in the usual out-patient clinic. The public health benefits of physical activity to reduce the risk of serious disease are well recognised. Increasing physical activity however increases risks of injury. Achilles tendon injuries in particular can be debilitating, leading to a catastrophic loss of lower limb function for many months. The Achilles tendon, the strongest tendon in the human body, is also the most commonly injured. With the increased uptake in recreational sport, this is resulting in 12-18 tendon ruptures per 100,000 people per year(1). Although tendons can heal, it is slow, and people need crutches and a cast and have difficulty walking for several months. Also the strength of the healed tendon never reaches normal. Even with the best current care, patients need 6 to 12 months of rehabilitation and sometimes the tendon ruptures again. As most people are of working age the consequences can be very disruptive; people usually get over a broken ankle much quicker. Also patients are often left with ankle stiffness, pain and weakness that may permanently affect their return to work or sport. This injury leads to a long absence from work and rehabilitation resulting in significant societal and NHS cost. Traditionally, tendon rupture is treated with a cast and splints to limit movement for several weeks. This controls pain and enables mobility on crutches, but may slow the healing process down. Some patients are offered surgery to try and speed up recovery but there are risks to tendon and wound healing which many surgeons don?t favour, such as infection. A cost effective and safe new non-surgical treatment that is able to improve the healing strength of the tendon and reduce the time to restore normal activities would be a major advance for patients and the NHS. Platelets are minute cells in the blood that help form clots when tissues are injured. They start the healing process in torn tendons by producing many active proteins (growth factors), that drive the repair of the damaged tissues for the first few weeks. PRP is a highly concentrated platelet extract from a small sample of a patient?s own blood. It can be injected into the same patient?s torn tendon to potentially boost the healing process. We have demonstrated that ability in extensive laboratory experiments, in conditions that resemble tendon injuries. These studies showed that PRP improved tendon healing by making the repairing tendons cells multiply and made them less vulnerable. In a small study on volunteer patients who had torn their Achilles tendon we saw larger, firmer healing of the tendon tissues, less pain and better recovery of activity with a PRP injection. This is encouraging but internationally there is not yet conclusive evidence. Despite that, PRP is starting to be used, including in the NHS, so there is a pressing need to better understand this new treatment. If applying PRP in Achilles tendon rupture does result in stronger tendon healing we would expect to see greater ankle strength and better functional recovery when compared to current treatment to justify its use. PRP is inherently very safe because it is produced from a patient?s own blood, eliminating the risk of transmitted diseases. There has been no report of any risk associated with this therapy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>HYPOTHESIS PRP application as an adjunct to standard care will achieve improved musculotendinous function and patient recovery after acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) in adults AIMS 1) Evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRP in acute ATR in terms of mechanical muscle-tendon function 2) Evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRP in acute ATR in terms of patient reported functional recovery, pain and quality of life 3) Identify the key components of PRP that contribute to its mechanism of action 4) Explore the immunohistochemical response of the healing tendon to PRP at the cellular and tissue level STUDY DESIGN Multi-centre, blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial of PRP in Achilles tendon rupture. Two sub-studies are embedded within the main study to contribute to the understanding of its mechanism in tendon healing: 1) Biological components in PRP: cells concentrations (PRP and blood), platelets activation (CD62P marker) and growth factor concentration in PRP 2) PRP immunohistochemical response in the tendon tissue in comparison to control (16 participants): needle biopsy at week 6 POPULATION All patients, aged 18-70, with diagnosed acute ATR within 7 days of injury who are suitable for non-surgical treatment. Exclusion criteria: Previous ATR, diabetes, vessel disease, renal or liver failure, blood disorders, refusing blood, anticoagulation, serious disease, unable to give informed consent. INTERVENTIONS Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention via a remote randomisation system using permuted blocks of random size stratified by site and age to minimise imbalance in mobility and tendon health. Participants will be randomised to: 1)Treatment group: PRP injection to the tendon rupture gap 2)Control group: sham injection (local anaesthetic to skin and needle introduction to tendon) Both groups will then follow a standardised casting and rehabilitation protocol. Detailed guidance will be given to participants and their physiotherapists to standardise functional progress within practical boundaries. We have demonstrated feasibility of recruitment, blinding, control injection, and practicality of the interventions and efficacy signals in a pilot study (2). A go/no-go feasibility assessment will be conducted in the 10th month of recruitment when approximately 50 patients have been recruited. The predicted site and patient recruitment rates, intervention compliance and safety will be assessed and discussed with the data monitoring committee, trial steering committee and reported to the EME Board. PRIMARY OUTCOME Heel-Rise Endurance Test (HRET): a validated objective physical test to measure calf muscle-Achilles tendon capacity to work (Joules) at 24 weeks(1,2). This is calculated by calibrated instruments and software, and is then converted into a limb symmetry index (LSI)(%), comparing injured and uninjured limbs to normalise each participant?s performance. SECONDARY OUTCOME 1)Achilles Tendon Rupture Score (ATRS): a validated patient-reported outcome measure of muscle strength, fatigue, pain and function(3) 2)Daily pain diary for 2 weeks (Visual Analogue Scale: VAS) 3)Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS): a patient-reported tool that focuses on patients? own functional recovery goals (4) 4)SF-12: health-related quality of life scale 5)PRP components analysis: cell count, Growth Factors (TGF, VEGF, PDGF, IGF &amp;amp; FGF) analysis and platelet activation (CD62P) 6)Immunohistochemical analysis: pain receptors, angiogenesis, collagen and proliferation markers ASSESSMENTS &amp;amp; FOLLOW UP Pre-injury ATRS, PSFS, and SF-12 will be recorded in the clinic at baseline and over the telephone at weeks 4, 7, 13. Pain diary returned after 2 weeks.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>127052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PATH-2 Study group</gtr:description><gtr:id>0C04BD12-13AC-46A1-944B-030E7E37B4BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91640d63ae1.40709771-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Mr Joseph Alsousou, University of Liverpool, is co-investigator and was author of the Study protocol.
