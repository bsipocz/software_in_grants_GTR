&lt;p>The training will target the needs of mid-career researchers who have already accrued experience but may not have a clear strategy for advancing towards expertise. It will offer insights about how to raise their game in pursuit of large research grants, high quality publications, and, in particular, the development of the mindset that facilitates interdisciplinary investigations of major questions with high social impact.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The training materials will be developed from information gathered from expert social science researchers. They will be trialled and deployed in six training workshops, and publicised at a final dissemination conference. Participants in the training will be able to cascade the material to support the learning of their own students and colleagues. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Areas of expertise to be explored include: &lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>integrating multiple methods; sharing work effectively across a team; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>anticipating and handling complications; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>identifying fruitful potential collaborations; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>communicating across disciplines; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>anticipating likely extra-disciplinary misconceptions in relation to the research foci, key findings, research culture and terminology in one's own discipline.&lt;br />&lt;/li>

Therefore, it was never anticipated that it would have direct impact beyond academia. However, for this reason our engagement with academia was more than developing new knowledge--it was an intervention, in the same way that someone else might have impact on schools education, or the effectiveness of business practices. 
The impact was in assisting researchers in the social sciences to think differently about their practices, achievements and aspirations, with particular attention to effective ways of improving the quality of their research, managing the conflicting demands on their time, and recognising what those who achieve outstanding international research actually do and how they learn to do it. The feedback we have had was consistently that the information from the project did indeed inform participants, dispel myths and give them confidence to see themselves as legitimate researchers with potential for ever better research. To summarise the activities that brought about the impact:
1. We used the project's research to develop training materials which were trialled through a series of workshops, with extremely good feedback from participants.
2. One activity in the workshops was the development of an interdisciplinary collaborative project. Subsequently, we have noted, in those whom we are able to track, a greater level of project-development with others from the same and other disciplines, and with non-academic partners. We believe that the workshop was a catalyst by offering ideas and building confidence.
3. As a result of one workshop, at York St John University, Wray was invited to become a Visiting Professor, and has since provided additional workshops informed by this project, to help develop the research of new and established researchers and develop strategy for the University.
4. We created a training handbook which was distributed to the attendees at our final dissemination event, and published on the Restore website www.restore.ac.uk/researchexpertise. Forty individuals so far have taken the option to leave their email address--others have downloaded it without doing so. The handbook was listed on Researchgate in November 2014, and this is drawing additional attention to it, as evidenced by contacts with Wray enquiring about how to obtain it.
5. Two professional trainers expressed interest in using the materials. Of those, one, Jen Denyer, developed her own materials based on the handbook and delivered them at an all day workshop at the University of Hull in September 2014.
6. We have published two research papers so far. One, published in 2011, outlines the existing research on expertise and the aspirations for future training methods to support researchers. The second, accepted for publication (for Spring 2015) examines the case of applied linguistics in particular, relating the project's findings from applied linguists to the nature of the research that they do. A further paper, focussing on the business and management data, is in preparation.
7. The project has had impact also on our own practices as researchers and mentors of others. It has become easier for us to articulate the necessities of effective research, and thus to navigate and guide others through the sea of demands and distractions, towards high quality research and well-articulated reports of it. In particular, it has drawn our attention to the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and how to make it work.
8. Wray drew heavily on the findings from the project when presenting her plenary lecture at the American Association for Applied Linguistics, Portland Oregon, in March 2014. Her talk aimed to raise awareness of the need for applied linguists to engage in new types of interdisciplinary research, and indicated how this can be done.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3461D31D-64E2-45C7-A195-3598DB0E8AA9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54959a3968d610.04717286</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We interviewed top international social science researchers to find out how they defined research expertise, how they had developed it, and how they supported others in developing it. The findings showed that learning continues through the career, that there are major benefits to collaboration, and that communicating one's ideas effectively with others is a key requirement of research expertise. The informants were highly committed to creating and sustaining a strong research environment for themselves and others, and their approach was characterized by curiosity, willingness to work at the edges of their comfort zone, openness to others' ideas, and tenacity, especially in relation to getting their work published.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our main output was a handbook for research leaders to support the development of social science researchers.
