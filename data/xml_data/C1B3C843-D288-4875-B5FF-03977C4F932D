I often dislocate sound and image by constructing fictional images around verbatim audio. In this sense, my working methods bear some similarity to the methods of verbatim theatre. \n(Verbatim theatre is the practice of carrying out interviews, which are then edited and intercut to create the text for a stage play.)\n\n'Buttershaw' continues this exploration by applying the methods of verbatim theatre to film. \n\nMy research project examines Andrea Dunbar's Rita Sue and Bob Too and Robin Soan's A State Affair via practice as research by making a third work about the Buttershaw housing estate in Bradford, West Yorkshire for 2010. \n\nMax Stafford Clark commissioned Andrea Dunbar to write Rita Sue and Bob Too in 1982. The play was described as a portrait of 'Thatcher's Britain with its' knickers down.' In 2000 Max Stafford Clark commissioned Robin Soans to write a play - a piece of verbatim theatre based on interviews with residents of the same estate in Bradford where Andrea Dunbar grew up and where Rita Sue and Bob Too is set. Robin Soan's play, A State Affair charts the devastating effects of cheap heroin on the estate. I was interested to find out that A State Affair was performed at the House of Lords in 2002.\n\nI intend to make a new work to create a trilogy of works about the estate. My project outputs will be: two site specific verbatim performances in which actors lip-synch to edited verbatim testimony, that will be performed and choreographed in and around the Buttershaw Estate and then again in the House of Lords and a feature length television film that will inter-cut between these two locations.\n\nWith 2010 in mind as a completion date, the new work would look at life on the Buttershaw estate 10 years on from A State Affair, and 30 years on from Andrea Dunbar's original play to see what, if anything has changed and, crucially, to examine the impact of the previous representations on the estate itself whilst acknowledging the history of it's representation on stage and on screen. \n\nMy methodology enables me to open up an investigation and questioning of the notion that there can be an accurate or 'realistic' representation of the estate on stage or on screen because of the limitations of the established languages of stage and screen.\n\nVerbatim theatre by its very nature (being performed in a theatre by actors) acknowledges that it is constructed, though it aims for a 'documentary' realism. The content of the proposed piece, i.e. the Buttershaw Estate, would usually be represented in fiction film in the tradition of social realism, a working method which aims to deny construct, aiming for naturalistic performances, an invisible crew and camera. In terms of documentary language this subject matter has often been represented using the techniques of direct cinema, a method that also makes claims for authenticity and yet aims to deny construct.\n\nThe working method I'm proposing is, I believe, an innovative approach to filmmaking. By juxtaposing 'documentary' audio and fictitious image sequences - in effect applying the methods of verbatim theatre to film - I aim to confront and question audience expectations about how this particular group of people are represented across the disciplines of theatre and film.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G006822/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
