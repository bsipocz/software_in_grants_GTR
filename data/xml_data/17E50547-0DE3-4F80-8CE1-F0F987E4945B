3</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L006731/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Investment in the British Inter-university China Centre (BICC) remains of vital national importance. We must look ahead strategically and adapt the UK's priorities swiftly and appropriately to address the research and educational demands arising from China's emergence, as what many today are calling &amp;quot;the Chinese century&amp;quot; unfolds. The UK Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office's 2010 strategy document, 'The UK and China: A framework for engagement', stated bluntly that &amp;quot;China's impact on UK interests is already critical, and it is growing.&amp;quot; One of the aims it set out for shaping the UK's response was 'equipping the British people to seize the China opportunity through better understanding of China and better Chinese language skills', and through 'increased educational and scientific links at institutional level between universities, research bodies, colleges and schools, and a greater two way flow of students, academics and researchers'. The objective of BICC's programme of activity remains as it was in the current phase: to inform and contribute to these strategically vital processes.

In BICC the universities of Bristol, Manchester and Oxford combined forces to develop the UK's premier teaching and research facility on China. Each of the three partner institutions had embarked on a major investment in this area, thus leveraging the long-term impact that the grant will have.

In its second phase, BICC foregrounded the building of new knowledge exchange partnerships with non-academic organisations, and the inauguration of new international research networks, in which knowledge exchange activities will be embedded, all of this activity being grounded in language expertise, and supported by a new programme of language training for university and non-university researchers in Chinese studies. 

In its third phase the programme of new activity maintains the impetus of the work already delivered, focussing on the humanities and languages areas and on knowledge exchange [KE] and partnership activity. Embedded in the wider institutional context of each partner, it continues to contribute to shaping debates and informing practice in key areas of policy concern including human rights, natural disasters, multiculturalism, and international diplomacy, as well as cultural engagement with creative sector SMEs, or other public or third sector cultural or civic organisations. It involves providing new vehicles for facilitating such engagement, including with international partners, providing opportunities for early career researchers, and extending the reach of BICC's engagement with UK and international partners. Activities will not be restricted to researchers and students already within the BICC orbit, nor to those at BICC partner institutions. KE has been central to BICC activities since the start of its operations, although many of our researchers and students have initially focused on academic career development: PhD research, academic networking, and publication. In this follow-on funding phase we are able to place KE at the heart of our structured new activity, and that way to provide early career researchers at an early stage in their development with experience and exposure to relationships and interactions outside the HEIs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our Pathway 1 programme of partnerships for knowledge exchange will demonstrate the value of research, knowledge and understanding in Chinese studies humanities and language areas for external partners, in particular in the policy, NGO and the cultural sector. Such KE engagement will be threaded theroughout our network activities as well, building on the models deployed in the first 7 years of BICC activity.

China remains a key area of growing attention for policy-makers. The culture and history of China have been shown by earlier and current activity to be critical areas of foreign policy interest, and will be addressed through our portfolio of networking and placement partnerships. BICC researchers at the FCO will have a direct impact on policy-making by writing reports for internal circulation and giving a presentation to its in-house seminar series, which involves the MoD, DfID and BIS. Moreover, the new co-director at Oxford, Barend J. ter Haar, has been active previously in the Netherlands behind the scenes with his own FO in the field of religious freedom. This is a highly sensitive topic, but one in which real contributions can be made by language based researchers. 

AHRC is also adopting a focus on UK creative economy engagement with China, and our programme of placements with the Chinese museum sector will support that activity, by building up a body of experienced early career researchers who have experience of working in that sector, and also a body of reports for circulation to international agencies (such as UNESCO) and to UK stakeholders.

Where appropriate, Pathway 2 research network co-ordinators will include government offices and creative economy partners in planning network activities, and in workshops and conferences. FCO has expressed much interest in historical approaches to UK-China relations, and to understanding contemporary China, so BICC will include it in its CEELBAS/BICC Russia/China, and 'The use of accusations in social and political conflicts' networks, as well as the 'Disasters' and 'China in Ten Words' programmes. BICC will also use research networks to pursue new ties with cultural institutions, government and policy-makers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313610</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An exhibition of photographs taken in clothes and fashion markets in Guangzhou (Canton), China, by BICC Knowledge Exchange Fellow Alejandro Acin in January 2015.

The exhibition was presented in a temporary space, a shipping container, outside Bristol's harbourside M-Shed Museum, 12-22 November, 2015. This was part of the national 'Being Human Festival', and the University of Bristol's InsideArts festival. A newspaper-format booklet accompanied the exhibition.

Featuring stunning video and a powerful score, World Factory is a thought-provoking investigation of fast fashion.

This show was researched by having a shirt manufactured in a Chinese factory. The show took place at the Young Vic theatre in London.

Other outputs from this collaboration included the digital World Factory shirt - a phone app to scan barcodes on the shirt - to reveal the people and processes behind how each shirt was made.

Underpinning this research process there was also an open and growing website, the Digital Quilt that shared nuggets of information between China and the UK. 

World Factory is supported using funds from the National Lottery through Arts Council England, Cambridge Humanities Research Grants Scheme, Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin and the Sino-British Fellowship Trust, as well as with the support of the New Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich; Young Vic; Company of Angels; Free Word; Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art (CFCCA); CSV Media Clubhouse, Ipswich; Birkbeck Centre for Contemporary Theatre; National Theatre Studio; Grass Stage; and the MPhil in Public Policy, the Digital Humanities Network, CRASSH, Judith E Wilson Fund and the English Faculty, all University of Cambridge.

Initially the remit of the project was to discover the provenance of one clock in the collection of Anglesey Abbey (AA), Cambridgeshire, which had been restored by Matthew Read, Brittany Cox and others at West Dean College. Following an initial inspection of the clock, and other items in the AA collection, it was soon realized that the project would need to expand in scope to include more than just this one clock, as there had clearly been a close relationship between two or more of the clocks in the collection since at least as far back as the turn of the nineteenth century.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Stanford University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>False accusations</gtr:description><gtr:id>634DB613-C119-4F0B-846D-DBDC2BE2152F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We take part in a workshop in early May 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb353cda642.19280797-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>My partners contribute their respective research materials, to see whether this approach will work or not.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I organize a workshop on the importance of false accusations as an instrument of social warfare in China.

It will be available free of charge for public use starting in mid-April 2016 on the Cambridge University Digital Library online platform. The material in this collection includes roughly 1,200 photographs, 4 diaries, and a range of miscellaneous material related to this trip, such as a sketchbook, receipts, and various related papers. One of my primary undertakings was I creating a range of supplementary material intended to support use of the digised material, including indexes of names of people, places, and organisations/institutions found in the material (including wherever possible versions in Chinese characters and in English), as well as edited typescripts of three of the diaries that will appear alongside page images. I conducted additional research in Cambridge, Bristol, and Oxford as part of creating this supplementary material and editing the diary typescripts. I was involved in planning and organisation of the digitisation, assisting the Needham Research Institute's librarian, John Moffett, and working with the Cambridge University Library's Digital Content Unit. This project is serving as a 'pilot' for future digitisation projects, and so I was also involved in preliminary discussions about future phases.

I also completed work on an ongoing project to compile an electronic version of data from a card index compiled by Needham while working in China's wartime capital, Chongqing, containing details of more than three thousand Chinese scientists and scientific administrators whom Needham met or worked with while in China.

I also selected images and created text for a 'pop-up' exhibition of ten portable roller banners entitled 'Chinese Wartime Science through the Lens of Joseph Needham'. I liaised with graphic designers from Dirty Design in Bristol, as well as University of Bristol's Print Services, on design and production of the banners. The exhibition was displayed as part of Open Cambridge 2015 and the Bristol Museum and Gallery's Chinese New Year Celebrations in 2016. I was on-hand at both events to answer questions from members of the public. I assisted with preparations for the NRI's participation in Open Cambridge 2015 and, with John Moffett, co-delivered three public talks relating to the collection and exhibition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Kyoto</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute for Research in Humanities</gtr:department><gtr:description>Kyoto Bridge network, BICC</gtr:description><gtr:id>2587F1DF-70F9-4754-8BE3-3625A1D91C4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshops, panel session, conference keynote.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d7e8f8908358.35550134-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In early July 2015 Professor Ishikawa Yoshihiro visited Bristol to deliver a keynote address at the 8th Annual China Postgraduate Network Conference on 2-3 July. This interdisciplinary conference was attended by 35 postgraduates and postdoctoral scholars from 16 different institutions across the UK, and from Ireland and the Netherlands, and was sponsored by the BICC, the British Association for Chinese Studies, and the Bristol Institute for Research in the Humanities and Arts.

Professor Ishikawa, Director of the Research Center for Modern and Contemporary China at Kyoto University, delivered a stimulating and well-received address on 'The Early Global Reception of Images of Mao', and was an active and generous contributor to formal and informal discussion during the conference suggesting many ways to rethink findings for many of the speakers, and suggesting avenues for further research.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>BICC's Kyoto Bridge network aims to build connections between scholars of Chinese studies in Japan and the UK, both established and early career researchers, building on the University of Bristol's strategic partnership with the University of Kyoto.

In August 2015 a team funded by the BICC made its way to Kyoto to participate in a panel co-organised with colleagues at Kyoto University at the 2015 World Economic History Congress, held in the city's International Conference Center. BICC Co-Director Robert Bickers, BICC alumni Dr Isabella Jackson, and Bristol University postgraduate research student Sabrina Fairchild, took part in a panel on 'Special Economic Zones: Treaty Ports and Port Cities of Maritime Asia, 1842-1942', alongside colleagues from Kyoto University, and, amongst others, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Heidelberg, Nottingham and Nihon universities, and UT Austin. The panel first convened on Sunday 2 August at the Humanities Research Institute at Kyoto University (Jinbunken), and then again during the Congress. Dr Jackson explored the business backgrounds of the men who ran the Shanghai International Settlement's Shanghai Municipal Council, arguing for the need to understand the political infrastructure in the treaty ports, while Sabrina Fairchild looked at Fuzhou's position within global and imperial shipping infrastructure to better understand change in the treaty port's maritime networks. Robert Bickers served as chair and discussant.

Discussion explored the need to understand the physical infrastructures that facilitated the growth of the network of treaty ports and port cities, as well as the need to think across borders - treaty ports are usually considered solely within national frameworks - and to understand how Chinese and other Asian communities made use of the infrastructures that evolved. Law and treaties, it was concluded, needed to be better understood and more routinely discussed. The panel was unusual in bringing together historians of Japan, and of China, and we emerged with a clear sense of the need to exchange views more routinely. The discussion in many ways built on the BICC phase 2 'Chinese Urban Studies Network', led by Isabella Jackson, as well as on the pioneering research of co-organisers Kagotani Naoto from KU, and economic historian of Japan Mark Metzler from UT Austin. It was also one of three panels at the Congress that explored treaty ports in nineteenth and twentieth century Asia, as port cities, 'logistics clusters', and as sites of the work of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.

The BICC team also had meetings with KU colleagues, including Professors Toshihiko Kishi and Kanazawa Shusaku, to discuss future potential collaborations and exchanges. British ties with colleagues in Japan in modern Chinese studies could be much stronger. Japanese resources for modern Chinese history are strong, and the expertise is deeply rooted, and the Kyoto Bridge activities have, we believe, materially strengthened connections between the research communities in BICC and the Research Center for Modern and Contemporary China KU, one of the network of Centers funded by Japan's National Institutes for the Humanities.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>White Rose East Asia Centre (WREAC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sacred Models</gtr:description><gtr:id>A9FFCC6E-8CCC-4B88-BA80-74875967230A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

Abstract: Since 2006 a small team at Bristol University has located, digitised and published online 9,000 historic photographs of China. Twice that number are being processed, and more arrive every month, Mainly sourced from families living in Britain with historical connections to China, these cover the period 1857-1950, range geographically across rural and urban China -- including nineteenth century Ningbo -- and were taken by professionals, talented amateurs and lucky snap-shotters, and form a rich, virtual archive. Robert Bickers, project director, will introduce the project, and its aims, progress and challenges.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d92f8d6d29a1.42853685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Roundtable discussion: 20 YEARS AFTER THE TOKYO SUBWAY ATTACK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>773C9F05-D3E2-4D38-8B62-E4F3F6CB4D8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event was a roundtable discussion titled &amp;quot;20 years after the Tokyo subway attack: the impact of Aum's violence in Japan and beyond&amp;quot;.

The workshop brought together scholars who are working on both 'traditional' and new modes of authority, on both institutionalised religions and individual religious specialists, and on different religious traditions and movements in Japan, Korea, the PRC and Taiwan. Workshop participants examined these issues from three main perspectives: scholarly discourse on religions; relationships between religious specialists and their supporting communities; and the state-religion interface. Project co-ordinators Erica Baffelli and Jane Caple are now working with the other participants to develop a publication and are currently in discussion with the editors of Asian Ethnology, a high profile peer-reviewed and open access journal about plans for a special double issue in 2017-18.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c8d6d86d4485.80496741</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cultural Engagement Partnership at the British Library: blogposts</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92147D7F-D3FB-4BF2-B4B7-E81FB96F7C33</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of my cultural engagement project at the British Library, I was asked to contribute three blogposts based on my research and activities during the project for the British Library Africa and Asia blog and the BICC website.

The workshop brought together scholars who are working on both 'traditional' and new modes of authority, on both institutionalised religions and individual religious specialists, and on different religious traditions and movements in Japan, Korea, the PRC and Taiwan. Workshop participants examined these issues from three main perspectives: scholarly discourse on religions; relationships between religious specialists and their supporting communities; and the state-religion interface. Project co-ordinators Erica Baffelli and Jane Caple are now working with the other participants to develop a publication and are currently in discussion with the editors of Asian Ethnology, a high profile peer-reviewed and open access journal about plans for a special double issue in 2017-18.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e17a07d41285.75955130</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bicc.ac.uk/research-networks/bicc-sacred-models-religious-authority-and-representation-in-asian-religions/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual Meeting, Association for Asian Studies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4386179E-D16C-4B0C-A4D1-1EA991E052D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited participant, roundtable on 'Thirty Years of Discovering History in China', AAS, Philadelphia.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d935f9a7c4a3.96337553</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk and Film screening by Tim Graf</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>73333236-69F7-4B26-8A60-E788897C3FAA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Film screening of &amp;quot;Buddhism after the Tsunami.

Panel description: 'The Ming period saw the creation of institutions and political centres that would help define Chinese governance and culture for generations. As we embark on a period in which China's economy and trade will lead global markets, this panel discussion examines the country's global role today and how other leading nations' economies, governance and culture might develop in relation to China.

The discussion was chaired by Robert Bickers, Professor of History, University of Bristol, and featured Jonathan Fenby, author, journalist and Managing Director of the China team at the emerging markets consultancy firm Trusted Sources, Steve Tsang, Professor of Contemporary Chinese Studies and Head of School of Contemporary Chinese Studies, University of Nottingham, and Elizabeth Wright, Chair of the Advisory Board of the China Policy Institute and Special Professor, University of Nottingham.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d929babbb774.63072860</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar/event_detail.aspx?eventId=1716&amp;title=Global%20China:%20past%20and%20present&amp;eventType=Special%20event</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk by Professor Fabio Rambelli</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C957BF58-E2F3-4E92-AEEF-6C27AEF7134C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were delighted to welcome Professor Fabio Rambelli to Manchester in September 2014 to open our series of public talks on Religious Authority in Asia.

Description: 
During the First World War, 95,000 Chinese farm labourers volunteered to leave their remote villages and work for Britain. They were labelled &amp;quot;the forgotten of the forgotten&amp;quot;, as their stories failed to form part of the public record on the War. This is just one example of many of the lesser known stories relating to China and the Great War. But these stories are now starting to be addressed.

To mark the centenary of the First World War, Penguin China has published a series of short histories on the economic and social costs it brought to China and the Chinese. Each book - written by a leading expert in the field - tells a fascinating tale which will fill the gaps of your China and WWI knowledge, including the only land battle in East Asia fought by Japan and Britain against the German concession in Shandong. Asia House hosted a panel with several of these authors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d930a4dafe54.51911220</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://asiahouse.org/events/peking-paris-china-first-world-war/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Screening and discussion of 'British Born Chinese' at the meeting of University of Aberdeen Chinese Studies Group, 21 February 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BCB700B8-D79A-42E7-858C-2A2EFDFB234C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited screening and discussion of 'British Born Chinese' attended by the members of the study group and students</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ca02866982.82048198</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk by Dr Birgit Staemmler</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D5867E7F-2AE7-48DE-B6B6-2E2F5C9AEC85</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk on &amp;quot;Competency, Reliability and Benevolence as Elements of Trustworthiness in the Websites of Japanese Religious Healer&amp;quot; by Dr. Birgit Staemmler (Tuebingen University) attracted a large number of undergraduate and postgraduate students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e17b10ba6054.43179619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38C3BACA-E3C3-4043-B4EE-DEE09BAD4EA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public talk on book 'Getting stuck in for Shanghai', which explores the contribution of British Shanghai residents to the First World War, and its legacies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d92ac4613f56.65180879</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited speaker, conference on 'The Lighthouse as a Public Good', Paris</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E239788-8672-4ACA-8936-36F6E79B36E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the launch workshop of a network, run by scholars from University Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, Maison des Sciences Economiques.

The network co-ordinator describes this as follows: This project focuses on the modes of financing and operating of lighthouses in Europe and its colonies, from the 17th century to the present day, in relation with their nature of collective goods. The approach is mainly historical, in its object (past periods) or the (sub-) disciplines that are used. Several levels of analyses will be developed such as: describe some modalities of financing in places or times that have not yet been studied, economically analyse these historic modalities of lighthouse-services provisions, link these historic modalities to the contemporaneous structure of the State, study the interaction between political debates on lighthouse-services financing and the contemporaneous economic debates, review the history of the use of the lighthouse example in economics literature and its diffusion in the non-academic world, etc.

This is an interdisciplinary project, which mainly unite economics (history of economic thought, economics of contracts, transport economics, public economics, economics of culture and heritage), history (economic history, history of architecture, history of sciences and techniques, maritime history), law (history of law, law and economics of property rights). This is an international project, uniting researchers from Estonia, France, Sweden and United States.&amp;quot;
