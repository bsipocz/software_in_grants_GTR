Software saturates everyday life. This research project analyses software diversity using data generated as people work on online code repositories and use programming Q&amp;amp;A sites. Repositories such as GitHub, Bitbucket, LaunchPad and SourceForge together host millions of software projects accessed by millions of people. While much recent debate around software, and the digital economy more generally, has attended to issues of intellectual property associated with open source or free software, this project aims to construct a new evidence-base for debate on these issues. It seeks to treat programming as a diverse set of practices amenable to social scientific analysis both in terms of the patterns of work (patterns of coordination, development of group structures) and in terms of the migration or flow of these practices across different settings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of the research is to track, analyse and characterise flows of practices within what we call the meta-community of programming practices. Our research will draw on&amp;nbsp; data produced when people make or code software together using public code repositories.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project focuses on ways of tracking practices through datasets generating during programming practices such as writing code. Given the timespan and close focus on methodological development, immediate beneficiaries of this research are located within academic or near-academic settings in the social sciences. 
We have identified several non-academic beneficiaries. They include practitioners of software development in various settings ranging across industry, government, commerce, media, finance, and innovation settings. The other main beneficiaries include industry advisory groups such as the BCS Open Source Software Specialist Group, and the UK-based Open Source Consortium. Software and IT- industry analysts might also benefit from our research. Finally, computer science and software engineering disciplines are academic beneficiaries through which the research can have indirect economic and social impacts. 
We regard software developers of all varieties as important beneficiaries. The research will have much significance for programming communities. Analyses of the popularity of programming languages attract much attention in online programmer forums and newsites (extensive coverage of TIOBE programming language index (TIOBE Software 2012) on Slashdot.org, a newsite widely read by programmers and software developers). This research will offer a more richer description of programming practices over time. We plan to present intermediate results of the analysis at industry software conferences such as the annual PyCon conference. As various results, visualizations and summaries of this project are published on the project research blog, the study should attract sustain social media attention and interaction with us via blog comments, and Twitter conversations. Our practices of dissemination (virtual machine via FTP and USB sticks, presentations at user groups and industry conferences, online documentation in blog, use of code repository for our code) are, moreover, designed to engage and to sustain interactions with these beneficiaries. 
A range of industry and policy advisory groups are public beneficiaries. Groups who promote open source software development, or provide advice on software-related activities to government and industry, are potential users of this research. In the software industry, as well as in various media and scientific settings, software development is a core innovation process. In its analysis of the diversity of programming practices, as reflected in code repositories and programming Q&amp;amp;A sites, the research will offer a uniquely comprehensive and comparative analysis of the importance and relevance of specific software practices (e.g. programming languages, computing platforms, application domains, etc.). It will also furnish an evidence-base for the development of policy advice in many areas affected or dependent on software development. While we do not see ourselves as delivering the kind of analysis supplied by industry analysts (e.g. Gartner Consultants or RedMonk), there are potential overlaps between their interests and the knowledge produced here. 
The research is in interdisciplinary dialogue with computer science and software engineering. These disciplines can have a more immediate impact on software development practices, partly through their training-educational activities, and partly through the pursuit of their own research priorities. In relation to users in academic disciplines interested in the domain of software development (software engineering), we think that our research could potentially open up different training priorities, and different perspective on what they teach. The research might also identify interesting research needs and problems that could be addressed by the development of software tools, or other technical innovation. These kinds of impacts are most likely to occur outside the time-frame of the funded research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92899</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Data visualization workshop, ITU Copenhagen 20 June 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>887DF238-8DEE-4907-9A32-9B156E417B43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This 1 day workshop attracted approximately 25 participants from Denmark and southern Sweden.

The project sought to explicitly engage with groups, organisations and devices (platforms, programming languages, software tools, data infrastructures) at a highly aggregate level (on the order of tens of millions of code repositories, and five million programmers and developers). The social and economic impact of this endeavour has not yet connected directly to these organisations, groups and individuals. Although the project's pathways to impact included software developer groups and communities, we did not manage to engage with them directly within the time frame funded by the grant.
We did, however, engage with the other related organisations during the course of the research in several ways. The main beneficiary of this work was, somewhat unexpectedly, Google Corporation. We made such extensive use of one data analytic tool -- BigQuery -- that the Google Cloud Platform Development team based in California contacted us directly to discuss our use of it. This led to a 90 minute Skype interview with Stefano Menti, a team manager at Google. This discussion, which Menti recorded, was largely focused on the ways in which cloud computing services (databases and compute capacity) could become more usable. At Menti's request, we also wrote a blog post for the Google Developer's blog describing our experience, but this blog post was not published. Although unlikely to be directly attributable to our conversation, soon afterwards, Google greatly reduced the cost of using BigQuery.
At the end of the project, we wrote a discussion paper for circulation through Google and other interested parties. This paper described our experience and some of the difficulties in working with large online datasets using cloud-based analytics tools. The paper was discussed at a workshop held in Google London, January 2014, with Google UK employees and other academic participants. The discussion paper is available at the 'metacommunities' Github repository</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D8A1E73A-F8D0-4BC2-93C0-EACF2D3B0BF6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5630ef9c3b5f55.89292696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The focus of this project has been on how software is made today. We have developed perhaps for the first time some ways of exploring the sheer volume and variety of software devices appearing in contemporary social fields. The key achievements of this work are:
1. By using data analytic techniques, we have begun to develop ways of mapping the relations between and relevance of the millions of software projects found on the code repository platform http://github.com. We have identified significant links between patterns of coding practice, forms of social organisation, and the underlying infrastructures and platforms shape the development of code. We have also begun to show how these links generate flows of imitations, copying and at times contagion around and through software.?
2. The research addressed important methodological problems in working with large volumes of data provided by contemporary social media platforms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods (including machine learning classification techniques), a selection of cutting edge analytic tools (Google BigQuery, and Google Compute) and working with live datastreams using programming languages (R and Python) to query, transform, aggregate and visualize event-form data, we developed ways of delving more deeply into the sometimes noisy and complex flows of data and events associated with large-scale media and collaborative platforms. We experimented with cutting edge data infrastructures ranging from cloud computing services to machine learning and data-mining techniques in working with our data. Importantly, we addressed some key problems of how to circumvent the limitations or packaging of data produced by the platforms.
3. We developed novel social theoretical constructs -- such as the concept of the 'field of devices' and the notion of 'metacommunity' -- to help understand the dynamics and processes we see at play around software, media, culture and digital economies. We believe that these constructs will be more widely useful.?They draw on existing sociologies of culture, technology, cities and crowds, and combine them with other recent social science accounts of device-specific research. Our work also addresses the need for viable and effective sociological alternatives to the somewhat flattened accounts of social life advanced by social physics and some computational social science.
4. Finally, practically emulating the subjects of our research, we were able to make use of the same practices and infrastructures as the people we were researching -- software developers and other users of code repositories -- to not only present the results of our work, but to document and distribute almost every stage of research work. We have developed a way of versioning the research project, including data analysis, scripts, documents as a 'release' that can be cited (using DOI identifiers) and that will persist through time.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are not sure of this yet, but early publications from the project and invitations to develop both the social theoretical insights and the data analytics approaches have started to appear. We think that the notion of 'field of devices' and some of the techniques we developed to explore the diversity of code as a metacommunity will be useful to analysis of other social, cultural and e
