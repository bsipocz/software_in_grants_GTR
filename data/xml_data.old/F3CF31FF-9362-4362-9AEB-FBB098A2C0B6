important role to play in the understanding of biomedical problems. This role has resulted in the recent explosive growth in fields such as Mathematical and Systems Biology. This proposal is focused on continuing an existing programme of week-long MMSGs and shorter follow-up meetings designed to foster and stimulate new collaborations between the mathematical and biomedical sciences. The MMSGs allow mathematicians, statisticians, biomedical scientists and clinicians to come together under `one-roof' for a period of five days, and to participate in the application of mathematical modelling techniques to problems presented by the biomedical scientists. The workshops are focused, collaborative meetings where the mathematicians work side-by-side with the biomedical scientists to tackle their problem. The new ideas that are generated can help to direct future experimental work and developing new informative mathematical models and techniques. Shorter one day follow-up meetings (three per workshop) allow collaborations developed at the workshops to develop further. MMSGs have a nine year track record of facilitating exciting interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians, biomedical scientists and clinicians which have led to journal publications and future research being funded through MSc and PhD studentships, fellowships and larger grant applications. The programme provides an exciting opportunity for interdisciplinary research and an excellent training environment for students and early stage career researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>40757</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Comparing placentas from normal and abnormal pregnancies</gtr:description><gtr:id>55460C97-2CCB-4382-BA16-F8B7A9E7E6CA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9739c0eb9739c2c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>A healthy placenta is essential for a normal outcome of pregnancy. The human placenta is described as a discoid organ approximately 3cm thick. The human placenta consists of a villous tree which is bathed in maternal blood. The villous tree contains fetal vessels, carrying fetal blood into terminal villi where it is brought into close proximity with maternal blood to optimise the transfer of nutrients and oxygen from mother to fetus and waste products in the opposite direction.



We have collected data on placentas from women with normal pregnancies and from pregnancies complicated by reduced fetal movements (RFM). Women with reduced fetal movements are at increased risk of stillbirth and intra-uterine growth restriction, so represent a group with a high possibility of abnormal placental structure. Our preliminary data show that women with RFM have lighter, smaller placentas than women with normal pregnancies.



To enable the comparison of placentas from normal and RFM pregnancies, we are specifically interested in developing measures of:



 The circularity of the placenta

 The centrality of the umbilical cord insertion

 The network of vessels on the fetal surface of the placenta



If this is successful we can then use these formulas to compare other pregnancy complications such as preterm labour and stillbirth.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mechanisms and localised treatment for complex heart rhythm disturbances</gtr:description><gtr:id>F2AF2F0C-4566-4BD4-B18C-94C50FCC0254</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b973f096b973f0aa-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>There are currently intractable problems in the study and treatment of heart rhythm disturbances.

Treatment options are limited and ineffective at preventing deafness after recovery. They are among the most heterogeneously-built viruses known, exhibiting a 20-fold size range, with spherical to highly pleomorphic virion shapes.



After a virus has copied its genome inside a host cell, the problem of packaging and transporting the genome arises. Enveloped viruses solve this problem with matrix proteins, which gather the genome and essential proteins into a membrane-bound virus particle ? a process known as budding. Little is known about the mechanisms of matrix-driven virus budding. It is difficult to study budding directly because it is a dynamic process that takes place on on tiny (~200 nm) patches of plasma membrane.



The study group participants are asked to help answer the following questions. Knowing the variation in size, shape, core density, complex density and relative complex organisation, is it possible to test the validity of budding models? In other words, given the output and variability inherent in the budding process, what can we infer about the mechanism? Secondly, can the above information be used to estimate the membrane bending forces involved in budding?</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Syngenta</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>HPPD inhibition case study</gtr:description><gtr:id>B38DA03C-A9BA-4EB5-B5F1-A4A32B73F66A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9737616b9737634-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of excess tyrosine, an amino acid, in the body of mammals. It is present mainly in the liver. One inhibitor of HPPD is used successfully as a pharmaceutical, where it acts by blocking the tyrosine breakdown pathway. However, the inhibition of HPPD can result in toxicities in some species, especially rats. In plants the same enzyme has a completely different role, being essential for the synthesis of components needed for photosynthesis. The inhibition of HPPD is the mode of action of a number of commercialised herbicides, as this inhibition causes bleaching and ultimately death of the plant.



A variety of in silico, in vitro and in vivo information is now available. The challenge is to suggest ways of making better use of the existing database to assess the potency and safety of new HPPD inhibitors. In particular, to explore the extent to which in silico and in vitro information can be used to predict in vivo outcomes in mammals.



Can the Study Group participants suggest ways of making better use of existing databases on relevant pathways to assess the potency of new HPPD inhibitors. In particlular:



 Can existing information be used to better predict in vivo outcomes for novel HPPD inhibitors?

 What insights are to be had on the relationship between in vitro and in vivo data?

 Can we better understand the relationship between mouse, rat and human responses in vivo?

 Can we use models to better address these questions?

 Can we use the data to better separate toxicity to plants and mammals

 What new data would increase the ability to make in vivo predictions based on in vitro data.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Spatial and temporal dynamics of signalling pathways</gtr:description><gtr:id>4A9C77D4-F8FD-4D99-8273-26588870BD8C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9732896b97328b4-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) carries a high mortality with 4.3 million deaths in Europe and over 2.0 million deaths in the European Union (EU). Atherosclerosis, which underlies the CVD related mortality, has been associated with a number of risk factors (eg. hypercholesteraemia, hypertension, diabetes and others) that are associated with progression of the disease. These risk factors predict a random or a homogeneous distribution of plaques over the arterial system, but this differs from clinical observations that indicate plaques are confined to curved vessels, bifurcations and side branches. It has been postulated that disturbances of the blood flow pattern at these sites could induce atherosclerosis there, either through a direct effect on the endothelial cells or by remote transport effects.



Endothelial cells sense the local blood flow by detecting the shear stress, although the mechanism by which they do this is not fully understood. Approximately 7 intracellular signalling pathways are modified by mechanical stimulation, and these regulate 8 acknowledged transcription factors, which leads to a total of around 2000 genes responsible for the response to shear stress. It is currently unknown which signalling pathway is dominant under flow conditions and what controls this activity. It has been suggested that specificity of signalling pathways resides in their spatial organisation and indeed for the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, one of the most fundamental for mechanotransduction, signalling specificity is by scaffolding proteins.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mathematical modelling of airway smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis in asthma</gtr:description><gtr:id>CDB38518-F6CA-49E7-ADD1-6C585BAF4153</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9732a08b9732a26-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Asthma remains an area of considerable unmet medical need despite the availability of medicines that are effective for large numbers of patients; no cures exist and available therapies may be ineffective in some patients with moderate/severe forms of the disease. It is estimated that 300 million people currently suffer from the disease globally, and that by 2025 this figure will be closer to 400 million. Poorly predictive animal models of the human condition have contributed to the paucity of new treatments and there is a pressing need for the development of more predictive modelling approaches.



The role of airway smooth muscle (ASM) in asthma is extremely important since it is widely recognised as the key determinant of airway narrowing in the disease, and as an emerging effector of airway inflammation and remodelling, contributing to airway hyperresponsiveness.



The Study Group participants are asked to consider the following in the context of understanding the role of ASM cells in the asthma. To what extent do cell proliferation and apoptosis participate in the turnover rates of human ASM cells in normal and diseased tissue; including the nature of apoptotic and survival characteristics of the ASM, and the signals that the ASM receives under pathophysiological conditions?</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Measuring vesicular release from neurons</gtr:description><gtr:id>3110DB85-6DC4-46FB-A304-18DEAF9EC291</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b973e646b973e664-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The human brain contains billions of neurons, which form connections involving chemical signals.

However, the potential for cellular entry and toxicity of manufactured nanoparticles has only recently begun to be investigated.



The cell is bound by the plasma membrane, a lipid bilayer which contains opposing monolayers, or leaflets, of phospholipids with the hydrophilic head groups facing the extracellular and intracellular solutions, and the hydrophobic tails facing each other. Generally speaking three routes for nanoparticle entry into cells exist, each of which must be analysed independently before a comprehensive model can be formed. These are: (i) direct diffusion; (ii) endocytosis; and (iii) ion channels and transporter proteins.



The Study Group participants are asked to help with answering the following questions:



 What are the relevant parameters that need to be considered regarding nanoparticle composition and the nano-bio interface?

 Can a model for diffusion of nanoparticles across the plasma membrane be generated that is robust enough to account for all potential variables?

 Can a model of nanoparticle endocytosis be generated that includes all potential trafficking pathways?

 Can nanoparticle entry through plasma membrane channels and transporters truly be excluded?

 Can an integrated model describing all potential means of nanoparticle entry into cells be produced?</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Pirbright Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Foot and Mouth Disease Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>29F740C1-A033-4BAB-BC21-1A049D0EEDDA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b973024eb9730262-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Follow-up meetings between the research group to explore possible avenues for future research</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The role of Cx43_mediated signalling in diabetic and non-diabetic wound healing events</gtr:description><gtr:id>D4808FA2-1023-4D51-8D14-30D78C7DDCBB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b973a212b973a226-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>A major complication for patients with type II diabetes is delayed wound healing and ulceration. This can result in chronic non_healing wounds with leg and foot ulceration and lower extremity amputations. Following 20 weeks of standard care around 67% of diabetic foot ulcers remain unhealed. Conventional treatments are labour intensive, costly and relatively ineffective, whilst pharmacological approaches have yet to show clinical utility. Thus defining new therapeutic agents that can be directly incorporated onto a wound bed in a topical form could provide significant improvements in patient care and reduce costs.



The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) exhibits differential remodelling in ?normal? and ?chronic? wounds, and small peptides targeted to this protein (CMPs) improve wound closure rates in ex vivo and in vitro organotypic skin model systems. In the experiments, we can compare cell dynamics during cell adhesion and migration under differing cellular conditions in the presence or absence of the peptides.



We propose to assess modes of cell movement and time taken for 50% closure of the ?wound gap? by determining spatio_temporal differences in cellular events. An ideal outcome from the workshop would be the development of an accurate and validated description of the wound healing process ? incorporating key factors, such as individual cell movement, cell_cell interactions, cell divisions, protein production and utilization.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Diabetic retinopathy</gtr:description><gtr:id>8AE254ED-38E3-4497-8C50-186126B15F58</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b988ec8ab988eca8-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Diabetic retinopathy, the commonest cause of blindness in people of working age is a direct consequence of raised blood glucose levels. Tight blood sugar control normally prevents development of this complication. This makes understanding retinal glucose metabolism of great clinical significance.



The aim of this problem is to develop a network model of retinal metabolism and then use it to investigate the impact of raised blood glucose and breakdown of the blood?retinal barrier on the network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>80000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Defining the role of connexins in diabetic and non diabetic wound healing events</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C176C2BC-9304-4C77-A957-6E004D3CD697</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5eddff425eddff56</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>80000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Mathematical Modelling of Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Media</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Glasgow</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C522E84C-1A73-4641-A293-121A5732E5C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ee27d745ee27d88</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Biomathematical modelling of Connexins in wound healing events</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>34549979-715F-4261-853C-7C97CC13301F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ede01725ede0186</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>997634</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Improved in vitro to in vivo extrapolation in chemical safety risk assessment of human systemic toxicity</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>ADA62601-B68C-42D2-8586-90C13666B308</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ec92cca5ec92cde</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>997634</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Improved in vitro to in vivo extrapolation in chemical safety risk assessment of human systemic toxicity</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>CFD24541-87AA-4A7A-BAC3-4C8E57AA7B18</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7903584621.75688206a3b2ea</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key Findings. This proposal funded a series of 4 Mathematics in Medicine Study Group (MMSG) workshops held at Imperial College London (2009), the University of Strathclyde (2010), the University of Reading (2011) and Keele University (2012). A total of 18 biological and biomedical problems were brought to the four meetings, from academia and industry. Reports were produced on each problem by the MMSG participants, electronic copies of which can be downloaded from the MMSG website (www.maths-in-medicine.org). The four MMSGs led to 14 follow-up meetings the details of which are as follows: 2013 (1) NC3Rs Study Group, 15th to 18th April 2013, Wellcome Trust building.

Arising from &amp;quot;Foot-and-mouth disease vaccines&amp;quot; (Imperial College London MMSG, 2009). The focus of these follow-up meetings was to allow time and exploration of work which had been undertaken at the weeklong MMSGs workshops, and the likelihood of this leading to further collaboration and possible outputs in the form of grants and publications. These activities led to a number of publications (as detailed in the Output section of this report) and further funding applications (see Further Funding in this report). A further outcome of this proposal was the links which were forged with the National Centre for the Refinement, Reduction and Replacement of Animals in experimental testing. The NC3Rs initially contacted Dr Steven Webb (organiser of the Strathclyde MMSG) with respect to submitting a problem on toxicology. This subsequently led to Dr Carl Westmoreland (Unilever) making a presentation to the MMSG audience at Strathclyde asking for mathematical input. The presentation was followed by useful discussion and ways of bringing more mathematics to the toxicology community. Following this, and a growing interest in the use of mathematical modelling as a strategy in the 3Rs, a follow-up one day joint meeting, which brought together key members of the UK toxicology community (both academic and industrial) and UK mathematicians to discuss areas of possibly collaboration, was held in London in April 2011. This subsequently led to a special call for funding by the NC3Rs in July 2011 from which 4 projects were funded. The MMSG programme has continued to collaborate with the NC3Rs, specifically advising on the different mathematical expertise available in the UK and bringing the two communities together. A follow-up meeting in the style of a small MMSG was held in April 2013 specifically focused on 4 problems with a remit in the 3Rs. This meeting was very successful and as a result the NC3Rs will be holding future such meetings. Other research output Work undertaken on problems at each of the MMSGs by the mathematical modellers has been presented in talks given at national and international meetings as well as through invited seminar presentations. Examples include the following. Work from the problem &amp;quot;The role of Cx43_mediated signalling in diabetic and non-diabetic wound healing events&amp;quot; (Strathclyde MMSG, 2010) has been presented at the following conferences.

Collaboration partnership This MMSG series, along with its subsequent follow-up meetings, have developed a number of new and exciting interactions between mathematicians and life science researchers. This is evidenced by the respective publications and further funding generated by the grant. As detailed in the key findings section, the MMSG programme has developed a strong collaborative partnership with the NC3Rs that continues to this day. Members of the MMSG community have become strongly involved with NC3R activities focused on bringing further uses of mathematical modelling in to the 3Rs including the PI being invited to sit on the NC3Rs Studentship Panel and Co-Is involved in directing future MMSGs in collaboration with the NC3Rs.

Dissemination/communication As a result of the international influence of the MMSG programme, Drs Tindall (PI) and Siggers (Co-I) were invited to attend the First International Workshop on The Role and Impact of Mathematics in Medicine (RIMM) in Paris from 10th to 12th June 2010. This meeting brought together around 100 life scientists, clinicians, mathematicians, engineers and physicists from around the world. A half-day session of the meeting was devoted to presenting and discussing the MMSG programme as a way of developing collaborations between mathematicians and life scientists. Drs Tindall and Siggers presented the concept of the MMSG to the audience along with 2 cases studies detailing problems they had worked on at previous MMSGs. This was then followed by a &amp;quot;mini Study Group&amp;quot; session in which two problems were presented to the audience, the audience was then split into two groups and discussions on how to model the set problems were discussed. This session was enthusiastically received by the audience and organisers and provided an excellent demonstration of the MMSG programme to an international audience of scientists and clinicians. Impact The research conducted at the MMSGs is nationally and internationally competitive. Much of the modelling work is of general interest to mathematicians working on systems and synthetic biology problems, as well as the stochastic modeling and computational modeling communities. Of special interest is the clear impact on NC3R policy - as a result of interactions with the MMSG series of Study Groups, the PI, Co-Is and other members of the MMSG community, the NC3Rs have adopted mathematical modelling as a key strategy area for use in reducing, refining and replacing animals in experiments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This proposal saw two problems brought to the MMSGs which were from industry and non-academic institutions. These were Syngenta (HPPD Inhibition Case Study, Reading 2011) and Institute for Animal Health (Foot-and-mouth disease vaccines). Work from the foot-and-mouth disease problem has been published (see Outputs, publications, (3)) and a publication from the HPPD work is in preparation. The breadth of biological and biomedical problems brought to this round of MMSG workshops means that the results of the meetings could be exploited in a number of ways, both in academia and industry. Examples include: - results from the problem &amp;quot;Using mathematical modelling to optimise work flow in the Sanger Mouse Genetics Project&amp;quot; which was brought to the NC3Rs follow-up Study Group in April 2013. The results of this work showed the importance of breeding between different mouse phenotypes in maintaining certain phenotype levels. This work was immediately exploited by the Sanger Mouse Genetics Project in allowing them to re-considering how different stages of the mouse breeding process were implemented; - Results from the problem &amp;quot;Unravelling the arenavirus budding mechanism&amp;quot; where the recently published work (see Publications) has allowed plausible mechanisms for how virus budding occurs, to be explored and elucidated. This work can be exploited to understand possible ways of controlling and even manipulating the virus budding process; and - Results from the grant &amp;quot;Development of Zonated HFB for IVIVE of Systemic chemical Toxicity&amp;quot; could be exploited to better understand the effect of systemic toxicity and develop new in vitro and in silico methods for studying toxicity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8CFA0961-370C-4D86-92B3-86E6E92CF45D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5649563582.287694776f702c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.maths-in-medicine.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6EBE2ABD-D2DC-4D48-9E44-1C17FA02C6C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>A
