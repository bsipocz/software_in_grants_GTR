Almost every cellular process requires some form of PPI which could in theory be modulated a molecular therapeutic opening up new possibilities for drug development. Protein docking has emerged to meet the challenge of understanding the vast number of different PPIs at the molecular level. Docking is used to predict the structure of a protein assembly from the high resolution structures of its constituent monomers. While there have been many recent advances in protein docking extracting native assemblies from the high background of potential states that are typically generated remains a significant challenge. New approaches that allow improved ranking of protein docking outputs are required.

In data-driven docking biophysical/biochemical aspects of protein structure are used as restraints to guide the selection of native conformations from protein docking simulations. Experimental outputs are typically simulated for each docking pose allowing them to be ranked according to the degree to which their simulated profiles agree to those obtained by experiment. There are many different types of experimental restraints that have been used to guide protein docking including those that report on protein size, shape and interaction strength. There are also a range of methods that provide direct insight into protein-protein interfaces and which offer enormous potential for data-driven docking. Nevertheless, leveraging the unique insights provided by these so-called footprinting methods has proven challenging.

Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a powerful footprinting and biophysical approach to study protein conformations. The technique reports on the change in mass accompanying the exchange of a protein's backbone amide protons for deuterium in D2O solvent resolved in peptide units of between 5 - 20 amino acids. For a binary PPI HDX-MS measurements are typically reported as difference plots between the bound and unbound proteins. These data provide direct insight into interacting protein regions as the isotope uptake at protein interfaces is slower in the assemblies due to solvent exclusion. HDX-MS is fast, sensitive, requires minimal sample preparation and is easy to automate and has the potential to revolutionise protein docking. However, the technique is currently limited to providing qualitative information on protein interfaces that cannot be used to critically evaluate different docking poses or to rank the simulated outputs.

In this research I will develop methods to simulate HDX-MS data directly from protein docking outputs to allow high throughput and efficient ranking of whole docking simulations. I have provided significant primary results that clearly show the potential of this method to extract native structures from protein docking outputs. This approach is completely novel and also timely given the increased interest in HDX-MS due to its recent commercialisation. It will have applications across a broad base of bio-science and bio-pharmaceutical research and will represent a new way of working for practitioners of HDX-MS and molecular docking. Funding is required for development of the approach and optimisation of the codes so they are more suited for protein interfaces. The method will be written as a precompiled executable and be provided to researchers on request allowing them to simulate HDX-MS data from any protein docking outputs. The technique will also be applied to characterise the quaternary organisation between the Staphylococcal repressor protein (Stl) and the phi-11 dUTPase to shed new light on this important biological system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is an established technique for understanding protein conformations and interactions. Recent commercialisation has brought HDX-MS out of specialised labs and into the larger domain. HDX-MS outputs are typically understood as difference plots between an experimental and a reference protein. These data allow the localisation of changes in isotope uptake along the protein backbone and provide insight on the direction and magnitude of the associated mass shifts. The speed and sensitivity of HDX-MS coupled to virtually zero sample preparation has helped established the technique in a range of sectors not least the biopharmaceutical industry. However, the qualitative nature of HDX-MS hinders data interpretation with no way to critically evaluate the outputs in relation to different protein structures. 

The aim of this research is to address some of the limitations interpreting HDX-MS data by developing a novel approach to simulate the isotope uptake of a protein from its high resolution structure. The ability to accurately simulate isotope exchange from protein structures has traditionally resulted in poor outcomes. However, I show with extensive preliminary results the utility of simulating data from protein docking outputs and the ability of this approach to successfully rank entire docking simulations to extract native assemblies. The overarching objective of this research is to develop a program that can simulate HDX-MS difference plots directly from protein docking outputs. Individual docking poses can then be evaluated on the parity between their simulated difference patterns and those obtained by experiment. The proposed research is highly relevant for protein docking given the low efficacy of current scoring functions and poor docking success rates. The proposed research will develop new applications for HDX-MS that have the potential to revolutionise protein docking.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>I expect the outcomes of this proposal to impact on many areas within the BBSRC remit through the development of new tools underpinning biological research. This research will most directly impact practitioners of hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) a powerful biophysical approach used to characterise protein conformations and interactions. HDX-MS has traditionally been the domain of highly specialised research laboratories but recent commercialisation by multiple vendors including Waters Corporation, Thermo and Bruker has brought this powerful technology to a much wider audience with a concomitant increase in HDX-MS applications. Much of the success and recent rise of HDX-MS is owed to the biopharmaceutical industry where HDX-MS is now a lead tool to in a range of different areas such as drug binding, formulation development, quality control, protein aggregation and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). There is also a recent emergence of HDX-MS outsourcing allowing start-up drug companies to access the unique and high throughput capabilities of this technique.

Despite the recent renaissance in HDX-MS and advancements in the technique data analysis workflows have remained relatively unchanged since the first descriptions of the method in the early 90s. It is currently impossible to use HDX-MS for ab initio structure determination or decide on protein conformations that best agree with the experimental HDX-MS patterns. The overarching objective of this research is to overcome this long-lasting limitation by providing novel workflows and programs that will allow researchers to critically evaluate protein structures in relation to HDX-MS outputs. The outcomes of this research will therefore impact a broad base of scientists in academia and industry by providing innovative and timely analysis tools for HDX-MS.

Research in protein docking will also benefit from the outcomes of this proposal. Protein docking is a large and international endeavour tasked with developing computational approaches that can accurately predict the quaternary organisation of a binary protein complex from the high resolution structures of its constituent parts. There is significantly more monomeric protein structures deposited compared with their assemblies and protein docking seeks to address this disparity by assembling these structures to provide molecular insight into the interactome. However, our lack of understanding on protein interfaces in general has resulted in low docking success rates and new scoring functions are required. The research addresses this problem directly by providing innovative methods to leverage the unique insight on PPIs provided by HDX-MS for data-driven docking. Given the speed and low sample requirements of HDX-MS the synergy of this method with docking has great potential in high throughput protein structure determination. This will impact a much wider structural genomics community although these outcomes would transpire long after the duration of the proposed research. 

The original HDX-MS platforms that were provided commercially were developed and manufactured by Waters Corporation the MS headquarters of which is based in Manchester UK. The UK is a global leader in MS instrumentation and has an internationally recognised track record in the development of novel applications of this technology from both academia and industry. In spite of the UK expertise in MS there are relatively few advanced HDX-MS practitioners at the national level compared with the US or mainland Europe. The proposed research has the potential to address this gap through the development of advanced HDX-MS workflows which could have economic benefits. This research will also provide a highly skilled PDRA who</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>221408</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R006792/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02FE9751-1497-4DFD-B349-D4A9C96538E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1163A5D2-CE35-4C7E-904E-6FB2B5FA0C2A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Multiprotein complexes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F14C04A0-571D-4298-AEAC-AEC5A0A9DB7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3493671D-A4CF-4197-90A7-3CCFBE1C0627</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools for the biosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
