Description 
The research was completed in January 2014 and explored the labour market experiences and aspirations of undocumented migrants from Bangladesh, China and Turkey (including Kurds) and the routes to self employment and employment practices, including in relation to undocumented migrants, among 24 minority ethnic entrepreneurs also from Bangladesh, China and Turkey. The research site was London and the research was conducted in the context of the economic downturn, increasingly restrictive immigration controls, raids on businesses suspected of employing people without correct documentation and the deportation of 'illegal' entrants, refused asylum seekers and visa-overstayers. 

Economic and societal impacts
Summary of economic and societal impacts
The project has produced a clearly identifiable number of economic and societal impacts, including through the encouragement of networking, by means of workshops, seminars, the Project Advisory Group (PAG) and end of project conference (December 2013). It has worked with a diverse range of stakeholder organisations, including trade union and employer organisations, government and NGOs and has participated with and assisted these organisations in their activities. It has produced three YouTube films that have been widely disseminated. Project findings have been presented at conferences and seminars, including events funded by the ESRC and to non-academic (as well as academic) audiences.

Throughout the project a key aim was to reach beyond the academic community to ensure that the research had and would continue to have a number of societal impacts. Engagement has been throughout the life of the project and taken the form of networking, dialogue, meetings, policies, training, written outputs (rights' guides, signposting documents and articles in trade union magazines, such as Labour Research with a circulation of around 6,000) and collaborative working. This was primarily initiated through the establishment of a Project Advisory Group, set up at the start of the project, enabling engagement with a range of different stakeholders from NGOs to civil servants, to film makers. The findings of the project have informed campaigns and policy advancement. For example we have worked closely with Migrant Rights Network (MRN) and Praxis, as well as with ACAS, the TUC and the Health and Safety Executive, informing them of our findings and contributing actively to their meetings and campaigns, where we have provided specific examples of cases that could be used to highlight the specificities of undocumented migrants in the UK. One of our focuses has been on the impact of sanctions on workers' rights and here we worked closely with trade unions and employers, producing a legal rights guide which has been widely disseminated and is available on the project website. For the REF 2014 the Director of MRN commented formally that our research has 'helped us [MRN] better understand the situation and informed a lot of our influencing work with government'.

Impact on policy
Our research has informed policy makers in a number of contexts. We have been invited to address a meeting of the All Parliamentary Group on Migration (APGM) and have participated in other APGM meetings. We have met with and been consulted by the Cabinet Office over undocumented migrants and workers' rights. We have produced a briefing document on government policy on sanctions that was discussed at a stakeholder meeting (hosted by and in collaboration with Praxis) in October 2013; distributed at our project final conference in December 2013; and which provided the basis for an article published in the journal Critical Social Policy. We are currently writing a blog for the LSE based on the project and this policy blog averages 15,000 visitors a week and has over 30,000 followers on Twitter so the research will receive considerable coverage and will, we hope result in further measureable impact. 
 
Impact on quality of life, health and creative output
Through the production of a Rights' Guide for undocumented migrants (and employers), we have contributed to quality of life matters by providing clear information to undocumented migrants about their rights, specifically on the protection of their health and safety at work and here we collaborated with ACAS and the HSE who both provided comment on the booklet's contents. We also produced signposting documents for the three groups involved in the study, given out at the time of interview but also available on the project website, so that they would know how and where to seek advice and support. The production of three films, outlining the stories of three undocumented migrants, has contributed to creative output in a variety of ways. First, it has developed a media tool which can be used in teaching and which has been widely disseminated. Second it has enabled skills acquisition with three community interviewers and two researchers getting film training and gaining experience of working on the filming and production process.

Scientific impacts
In terms of its scientific impacts, we have contributed to theory and theoretical ideas, primarily through the publication of five articles in journals (two published in the UK, one in Europe and two in the USA). We produced an ethics case study for the ESRC Framework for Research Ethics. We conducted an experimental online focus group with employers, which initiated some dialogue between employers on the ethical and business case of the employment of undocumented migrants. We have presented our findings at numerous conferences and seminars including ESRC funded events in Leeds and Lancaster, as well as at a COMPAS breakfast briefing with it's mixed policy, practitioner and academic audience. 

Impact through capacity building 
Our capacity building activities included the provision of specific training to fieldworkers as well as offering them access to academic research methods courses taught as part of the MSc in Social Research Methods at City University London. These MSc courses were also offered to PAG members and two attended a course in Qualitative Research Methods and this, together with the networking opportunities we have promoted, have enhanced the effectiveness of the services, and possible evaluation capacity, offered by trade unions and NGOs. One of the community researchers also received training in NVivo and presented a paper based on her experiences of the fieldwork at the end of project conference as part of skills acquisition and career development. 

Ways of achieving impact 
We have disseminated our research using different formats that included non-academic articles and video materials and have been consulted by two different film makers developing documentaries for television. Through writing, presentations and attendance at meetings we have taken a specific perspective on gender and undocumented migration, producing both academic and non-academic outputs (see portfolio). Our web site is still active and contains materials from the project. 

On-going impacts
We are continuing to publish our analysis and findings from the project and to develop our theoretical positions. This month (January 2015) we have submitted a book manuscript based on the research to Policy Press, with publication scheduled for early 2016. We intend to develop two more academic articles from the research data for refereed journals. We are also continuing to disseminate at academic conferences and this year we have accepted invitations to speak about the research at Stanford University, University of Oxford and SOAS, University of London. We will continue to engage with stakeholders and policy makers on the issue of undocumented migrants.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1A78A985-2D6E-4EC0-81EB-70D32331382C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54c90bafa9cc69.13026620</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant set out to interview undocumented migrants (60) and ethnic enclave employers (24) from Turkey (including Kurds and people from Northern Cyprus; China and Bangladesh) and to carry out an asynchronous internet focus group with employers. The aims of the research were to explore the labour market experiences of undocumented migrants within an increasingly constrained policy and economic environment. We set out to examine decisions to use or not use co-ethnic networks in the search for work within or outside ethnic enclaves from the perspectives of migrants and migrant entrepreneurs. We also aimed to contribute to and develop theoretical debates in the area of social capital based on the specific case of undocumented migrants, in the context of worker/employer relationships, in particular on the basis of ethnicity, power, class and gender. 

The major of achievements of the grant, to date have been:

To successfully carry out the fieldwork interviews with a very hard to reach group (undocumented migrants) and to obtain sensitive data on their social and economic lives as well migration journeys, transnational linkages and aspirations and to successfully interview 24 migrant entrepreneurs and to carry out the internet focus group, to explore their businesses, recruitment, use of social networks and their changing (or unchanging) positions of the employment of undocumented migrant workers within the current sanctions framework. 

1. To contribute to policy debates by exploring the impact of raids and sanctions on undocumented migrants and employers (e.g. a stakeholder policy workshop, a sanctions policy documents and a published paper in Critical Social Policy).

2. To consider how power, gender, immigration status and other intersections affect workplace relations (Policy Press book forthcoming 2015).

3. To critically evaluate and build on theories of social capital, in relation to the experiences of undocumented migrants (Policy Press book forthcoming 2015).

4. To have engaged in extensive non-academic impact including capacity building activities (training and development as well as the production of documents including signposting and a rights guide).

5. To have disseminated widely for the grant to a range of different audiences including academics, policy makers and other stakeholders through presentations, written outputs, the project website, podcasts and films.

6. To have facilitated networking and knowledge exchange among academics and non-academic stakeholders through the sanctions policy meeting, the project advisory groups, mid-project workshop and end of project conference. 

7. To have engaged directly with policy makers through different routes including those mentioned above and directly through an invited presentation at the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration and Migrant Rights Network and a meeting with Richard Chapman from the Economic and Domestic Affairs section of the Cabinet Office who was working as part of a small team in the Cabinet Office examining illegal working practices in the illicit economy. The Trades Union Congress recommended that Richard Chapman contact us as a consequence of this research. 

8. We assisted a producer Seamus Mirodan, for Insight, an award-winning documentary production company, with a project he was working on for Channel 4 based on migrants in London, including those who are undocumented. We arranged his contact with some of the project stakeholders, community organisations and one of our community fieldworkers. We also met with award winning documentary filmmaker, Sean McAllister, who was working on a film proposal on undocumented migrants to discuss our research findings. 

The grant objectives have almost all be met. One area where we did not quite meet the objectives was the shortfall in interviews with undocumented migrants from Bangladesh where we had intended to interview 20 but only managed to access 15 and then had to stop trying to locate this group in order to finish the research. We found that Bangladeshi undocumented migrants were less likely to share information about their status and so were less likely to be known to each other for snowballing and other access routes making them harder to reach. This was in spite of tremendous efforts including a huge amount of networking and cold calling by both the university based team and the community interviewers. 

The grant has produced two data sets and the main findings are: 
Findings undocumented migrants 

Reasons for migration varied; most often it was economically motivated or due to fear of persecution. A number of interviewees used smugglers or agents to organise their journeys, resulting in debts. Others entered on visas. 

Work was found through existing or newly developed social networks. Over time routes into work expanded to include previous employers and individual strategies such as the internet, community newspapers and cold calling. 

Fewer women were currently working than men usually because they had young children. However their lives were isolated; for some dependency on a partner was problematic. 

Clustered in a small range of largely unskilled and less regulated workplaces, there were few opportunities for vertical mobility and limited possibility of horizontal movement between sectors. Work was characterised by low pay, generally below minimum wage. They felt themselves disadvantaged relative to other workers. Little choice was exercised in the workplace, although a minority was able to exert individual agency to make incremental job progression through skills' acquisition and expanding social networks. 

Government policy, especially sanctions, created high levels of fear but had not negated the need for work. The consequences appeared to be a worsening of terms and conditions and a greater vulnerability among some undocumented migrants. 

The lack of a formal immigration status was the lens through which undocumented migrants lived their everyday social and economic lives. It informed all decision-making and inhibited wider non-community social networks, limited spatially mobility and negatively impacted on any potential for integration and rights' claiming. It also created greater levels of dependency on employers and co-ethnic networks, increasing potential for exploitation. 

There was evidence of a hierarchy based on immigration status; however these were more complex and intersected also with class, religion (sects) and caste. 

Findings employers

Some went into business because of discrimination and blocked opportunities. Others came from families with a history of entrepreneurship. 

Decisions about who to employ were informed by skills' shortages consequent on immigration controls, small low profit margin businesses, trust derived from social networks and obligations. 

Employers were aware of sanctions, knew the implications of breaching employment regulations and carefully weighed up whom they employed and in what capacity. Tactics to minimise risks included: short-term employment and employing small numbers of undocumented migrants within a larger pool of documented migrants. Fewer claimed they employed undocumented migrants than in the past, although around a third still did so. There was clear evidence that social networks, kinship, community, political obligations, ethnic and political solidarity, their own experience of being an asylum seeker or undocumented migrant, availability of workers, linguistic, cultural and gender preferences, perceptions of 'good' workers, government policy and economic considerations influenced employment decisions. 

Stereotypical concepts were adopted of what constituted a good worker based on ethnicity and gender. 

Trust was a unifying aspect of the ways in which both employers and undocumented migrants operated in relation to employment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have implications for policy and theory. Policy makers can evaluate the limitations of current approaches of internal sanctions by reading our outputs and consider the alternatives that we have suggested. We will continue to engage with policy makers and intend to do more work in this area over the coming 12 months. Campaigning organisations, unions and rights groups can use our findings to show the difficulties experienced by undocumented migrants and their vulnerability to and experiences of low pay and precarious work. They can assist in campaigns to show the gaps between employment rights and the reality of workers' experiences. They can use our publications, in particular the rights and signposting guides, to provide advice and support. Stakeholder groups and academics, as well as policymakers may utilise our three YouTube films to encourage discussion around undocumented migration. We will continue to work closely with NGO and other organisations to take forward our work that shows the realities for the most excluded and hidden workers. We will contribute to theoretical and other academic debates through our continued dissemination in journals, edited books and our own book from the project to be published by Policy Press in 2015. We have already published in some leading journals and will continue to write from the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BC5BC1DA-9064-44C3-BBBE-01B980AB7C02</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c4e8d0ac81.40632315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
