The core of the method is the growth of bone tissue on a initial artificial porous scaffold which mimics real bone. The growth is achieved by flowing stem cells through the scaffold until it is replaced by bone tissue which closely resembles the patients own bone. However, much optimisation is needed before this therapy can be implemented. One of the important factors is the number of cells that are placed on scaffold at the start of the several week culture period necessary to create the tissue engineered construct. The correct number and location of starting cells placed onto a scaffold is critical in determining the functionality of the resulting construct. This project aims to optimise cell-seeding methods on the scaffolds, by developing an experimentally validated computer model. The validation, and subsequent investigation, will import real experimental geometries into the flow model; these will be achieved using digital data captured by micro tomography and other methods. The modelling component is a vital element of the proposed project; it overcomes (i) the problem of the inaccessibility of experimental data in complex flow geometries and (ii) the high cost of exploring the potential parameter space experimentally. Expertise from both Keele University (in tissue engineering and bioreactor design) and Sheffield Hallam University (in flow modelling techniques) will be utilised synergistically in order to address the project aims in this joint proposal. Cell type, attachment proteins, scaffold geometry/chemistry, media perfusion rates and mixing techniques will all be analysed in order to investigate the optimal method of cell seeding for bone tissue engineering. The optimised flow model, which will also make timely use of the most recent mathematical modelling information available (eg King, 2005), will then be practically tested in a sterile laboratory environment. Biochemical assessment will be undertaken to determine the efficacy of the predicted, optimised methodology. Utilising modelling techniques in this way, it is possible to significantly reduce time and costs that would otherwise be spent in the laboratory optimising these essential parameters for tissue engineering.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Bone tissue engineering is an emerging therapy for treating patients undergoing orthopaedic trauma or disease. However, much optimisation is needed before this therapy can be implemented. One of the important factors in bone tissue engineering is the configuration of placing the cells on a scaffold at the start of the several week culture period which is necessary to create the tissue-engineered construct. Determining the optimal number and location of the starting cells placed onto a scaffold is critical to the functionality of the resulting construct. This project aims to optimise cell-seeding methods on porous 3D constructs, using a lattice Boltzmann (LB) mathematical modelling technique employing the real experimental geometries which will be digitally captured using micro computed tomography (CT) and other methods. Cell type, attachment proteins, scaffold geometry/chemistry, media perfusion rates and mixing techniques will all be analysed in order to determine the optimal regime of cell perfusion seeding for bone tissue engineering. The modelling component is a vital element of the proposed project; it overcomes (i) the problem of the inaccessibility of experimental data in complex flow geometries and (ii) the high cost of exploring the potential parameter space experimentally. Validation of the optimised theoretical model will be performed experimentally using microCT imaging of both fluid flow and cell seeding amongst other techniques.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>509341</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>134000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Follow on Funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/M013545/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>99D6393E-1184-470F-AC65-0E2BDADE71F6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c8347c41a421.74243122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has gained data to understand the fluid flow dynamics of the culture media and subsequent wall shear stress effects on cells seeded throughout a porous 3D scaffold and cultured in a perfusion bioreactor.

Experiments designed to validate the mathematical model developed by Sheffield-Hallam team included imaging of location of cells in simple materials and geometries as well as fluid flow profile inside a perfusion bioreactor.

The first set was tackled by combining technology available for MRI, super-paramagnetic particles, attached to stem cell membrane to tag the cell using a microCT. MicroCT is used for materials characterization as soft tissue and cells do not absorb x-ray. By attaching these specific magnetic particles we imaged cell deposition at high resolution. This method allowed us to provide data to feed and validate the mathematical as a non-destructive tool. Because contrast agents were not required, the scanned sample can go back into culture and re-scanned when needed to track cell deposition and proliferation.

The fluid flow was imaged with a clinical equipment bought for this grant, the XtremeCT. This equipment, with good resolution for a clinical scanner, provided us with an open scanning space to locate complex systems (bioreactors) and track fluid flow when using contrast agents. This was of fundamental use for the developing of the mathematical model given that these results demonstrated the importance of the gravity factor in the mathematical simulation.

We also adapted a protocol to image super para magnetic particles used in MRI to track live cells using a microCT scanner. This protocol has the potential to follow up live cells in 3D in real time without damaging the samples. This technique, although need more development and investment, could be very useful for tissue engineering and in vitro toxicology screening.

7) The XtremeCT bought for this grant will be used for basic research projects but also for clinical trials and patient follow up</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key results of the project are:
1) Validation of mathematical models for perfusion bioreactors for tissue engineering can be completed either by validating the fluid flow inside the perfusion or by validating the cell deposition, proliferation and differentiation inside the construct when seeded using perfusion.
2) Fluid flow was imaged using the XtremeCT and in-house made Nylon bioreactors. The systems were perfused with culture media and then Lugol's iodine solution and scanned in &amp;quot;real time&amp;quot; as the liquids entered the chamber and diffused through the scaffold constructs. Although the image resolution was limited, it was possible to determine that heavy agents, such as iodine solutions, are greatly influenced by gravity, which the mathematical model neglected in the first instance. 
3) Perfusion seeding was assessed uni-directionally at 0.003 ml/min, equivalent to the velocity of single cells travelling inside the scaffold pores in a standard perfusion flow rate of 0.01 ml/min. &amp;quot;Simple geometry&amp;quot; experiments were assessed to verify cell adhesion in straight and 90 degrees bended sections, which matched the mathematical model boundaries.
4) Online cell tracking was successfully done by magnetic labelling and microCT. Fluorescent tracking could not be used due to the auto-fluorescent nature of many biomaterials causing false positives. We imaged cells, seeded into tygon tubing pre-coated with fibronectin, by attaching specific super paramagnetic nano-particles to our mesenchymal stem cells prior to seeding. Samples were imaged at high resolution and cell deposition indicated that, contrary to what the mathematical model predicted, the cells attached to the external part of the curvature when the cell suspension changed direction. 
5) Although this data also enabled the use of microCT as a non-destructive tool to image 4D constructs (scaffolds and cells) in real time; the contrast-agent free imaging was not optimized due to time and resources constraints.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4C8035D1-880B-4EE7-89F7-6A7CF85F30C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0258c074765.50423018</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/perfusionbioreactor/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D252FDC-F8CD-4D57-BA85-85C2C5FD9EFE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Polarization of hydroxyapatite: influence on osteoblast cell proliferation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta biomaterialia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a011372df831db18e844680c3913e8fd"><gtr:id>a011372df831db18e844680c3913e8fd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kumar D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-7061</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758caf6ad1a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0031DD43-3626-4269-8227-300EC925A52A</gtr:id><gtr:title>3D sample preparation for orthopaedic tissue engineering bioreactors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5465c854345d2c8abf85252bcd915ad7"><gtr:id>5465c854345d2c8abf85252bcd915ad7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cartmell SH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1064-3745</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758e4f984d0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B5568409-CF7F-4CA0-A352-4C3AB83B1EDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>In silico multi-scale model of transport and dynamic seeding in a bone tissue engineering perfusion bioreactor.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biotechnology and bioengineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/49e863bf7202de2efab73b940209730d"><gtr:id>49e863bf7202de2efab73b940209730d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spencer TJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-3592</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675d7b4910a6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>21650E95-C6BB-4429-84D8-E50042A5B88F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electrical Stimulation Enhanced Mesenchymal Stem Cell Gene Expression for Orthopaedic Tissue Repair</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c3ca48b9357bca859ffeed5704d73b5b"><gtr:id>c3ca48b9357bca859ffeed5704d73b5b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Balint R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2157-9083</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a34ebeb775ab2.02659971</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3E318907-BBAF-41C6-BDDA-F52EDC459498</gtr:id><gtr:title>Osteoblast activity on carbonated hydroxyapatite.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of biomedical materials research.
