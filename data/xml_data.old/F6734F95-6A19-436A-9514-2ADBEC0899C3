To make much needed &amp;amp; significant progress on a wide range of important applications there is an urgent requirement to systematically address the associated methodological issues within a common framework and this is what motivates the current proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101469</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>John Innes Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Vaccine Design In Silico</gtr:description><gtr:id>940DC3DF-45EE-44A4-ACC6-72C914FC5075</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d05124b9d05142-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>We have stablished a research collaporation with the Chemical Biology Laboratory of Huib Ovaa at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), and Dr Richard Morris of the John Innes Centre (JIC), to develop algorithms and sofware to assist in the design of peptide thearapies.

This project has made progress in adapting existing machine learning techniques for such non-standard learning problems.



We investigated active learning, variable sampling distributions and disparate class frequencies via two case studies in computational biology: Firstly the detection of natively unfolded regions in proteins, and later predicting the binding affinity of peptides to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule (a key step in predicting immune response). Additionally, we found that over-fitting in model selection is a key issue in such applications of machine learning algorithms, and can also cause substantial losses in generalisation performance. We have developed methods to deal with this problem. We have produced a software package for use by out collaborators at the Netherlands Cancer Institute to assist them in the design of peptide therapies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The VaDIS sofwtare we have developed during the project has application in the design of peptide therapies for a number of illnesses, and we are currently seeking to exploit our work in conjunction with the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Machine learning and data mining are widely used in science and industry. The key algorithmic developments resulting from the project can be directly employed in applications of these methods to improve performance and to obtain unbiased performance estimates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E0798D35-47B3-4250-82BD-24D12B2C1E56</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2635916511.189114677740f38</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>49B71EE8-B443-4CB9-A558-42F3D47B64F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Kernel learning at the first level of inference.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/48157732e217fb619df9fcb7c8e06353"><gtr:id>48157732e217fb619df9fcb7c8e06353</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cawley GC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0893-6080</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d00200246d096d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>361EE883-2333-4599-A033-9F641653E588</gtr:id><gtr:title>Over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Machine Learning Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/36c4d59580ab609efcad161dd172ad17"><gtr:id>36c4d59580ab609efcad161dd172ad17</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gavin Cawley (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_49565714371384336c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>73B0C119-58CB-4CB8-9201-1AC2CE2577FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sparse Bayesian prediction of disordered residues and disordered regions based on amino-acid composition</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72da0395dac4c51530899cb7fb68b9eb"><gtr:id>72da0395dac4c51530899cb7fb68b9eb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cawley G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4244-9635-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0590596b80abe</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F010508/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
