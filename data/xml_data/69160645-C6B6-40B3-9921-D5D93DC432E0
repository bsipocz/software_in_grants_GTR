This application for Follow-on Funding aims to build upon the comparative research conducted in the Beyond Legalism project which explored the use of amnesties in conflict transformation in South Africa, Uganda, Uruguay, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Argentina. Originally, that project did not include Northern Ireland, as the debate was not a 'live' one at the time. Since that grant was completed, the public need for an internationally and legally informed contribution on the relationship between amnesties, non-prosecution and dealing with the past in Northern Ireland has become increasingly apparent. Together with the partner organisation, Healing Through Remembering, this proposal seeks to address that gap.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The overall aim of this 12-month project is to facilitate a process of knowledge exchange between the academic team, the project partner and key local actors on the role of amnesties and prosecution in dealing with the past in Northern Ireland. To achieve this aim, the project objectives are:
1. To engage in a process of gradual knowledge exchange through a carefully sequenced pattern of engagement with key local actors, including victims, former Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries, security force members, politicians and civil servants, and civil society representatives. This engagement will move from a series of private briefings for key constituencies during months 1-3; to a series of invite-only roundtables in months 4-8 that will explore themes identified on the basis of the Beyond Legalism project research; to a public conference at which local and international scholars and practitioners will explore the project themes in month 11.
2. To disseminate the Beyond Legalism findings and inform public debate through strategic interaction with print, broadcast and online media, and the creation of a project website.
3. To reflect upon and disseminate the knowledge produced in a project report and a fully theorised academic article (which will focus explicitly on this style of knowledge transfer).
4. To work with our project partner to enhance the organisation's technical capacity.
POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS
This project will benefit a range of non-academic audiences. Within Northern Ireland, beneficiaries will include the project partner, other local civil society organisations, relevant government departments, policing organisations (PSNI, HET and Police Ombudsman), human rights groups and legal institutions (especially Public Prosecution Service). These groups will benefit from the private briefings, invite-only roundtables, and public conference. For NGOs, this engagement will again enhance their knowledge of the international legal framework concerning amnesties and of how other jurisdictions have grappled with these challenges. For governmental actors, the project will contribute to greater evidence-based policymaking and, potentially, impact on the operational and organisational culture of relevant institutions. For all local users, the project will create a space for informed and debate on highly sensitive topic.
Elsewhere, the project will benefit policymakers within the United Kingdom, Ireland, and internationally who work on transitional justice. The proposed programme of knowledge exchange and dissemination will provide a transferrable methodology and will contribute to evidence-based policymaking among international actors, and raise international awareness of the complexities of balancing immunity, truth and prosecutions.
The project will also be of interest to academics working in the fields of political science, criminology, international relations, anthropology, sociology, peace studies and conflict transformation. The project will develop and refine the theoretical contributions of the Beyond Legalism project and will propose a methodology designed to address critiques of international comparative work as rarely offering tangible benefits for the local community</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?

Beyond its academic contribution, this project will impact positively on non-academic users in Northern Ireland currently engaged in debates about dealing with the past. The project partner, Healing through Remembering (HTR), will benefit directly, as will a wide range of other local civil society organisations working in the field including victims groups, former combatant organisations, and former security force member organisations - all of whom will be targeted in the dissemination strategy. Relevant government departments, policing organisations (PSNI, HET and Police Ombudsman), human rights groups and legal institutions (especially Public Prosecution Service) will also benefit.

Outside Northern Ireland, the project will be relevant to policymakers within the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland involved in this field. The project will also be indirectly beneficial for state and intergovernmental actors that intervene in dealing with the past work in Northern Ireland, including the European Union, Council of Europe Committee of Ministers and the United States government. Internationally, this project will enhance the work of actors in transitional justice, peacebuilding and conflict transformation through the knowledge produced and the innovative methodologies employed. Elements of the UN, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organisation of American States, the African Union, the British FCO and the US State Department all engage with the tension between amnesties, prosecutions and truth recovery. In addition, the project will assist with transnational civil society actors, such as the International Center for Transitional Justice. Finally, the project will contribute to the skills and experience of the project team.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

HTR will benefit through the exchange of knowledge with the project team, in particular the research capacity, knowledge and technical skills drawn from the international context and legal elements of the subject matter.

Local stakeholders will benefit from the private briefings, invite-only roundtables, and public conference. For NGOs, this engagement will again enhance their knowledge of the international legal framework concerning amnesties and immunity and how other jurisdictions have grappled with these challenges. For governmental actors, the project will contribute to greater evidence-based policymaking and, potentially, impact on the operation and organisational culture of institutions such as the HET and the civil society organisations that support them in engaging with affected families. For all local users, the project will create a space for informed debate on a highly sensitive topic. More broadly, the project will raise awareness and understanding of this divisive issue through its media strategy.

The project will also seek to engage policymakers, donors and practitioners within the UK, Republic of Ireland and elsewhere through the use of policy and academic outputs, which will analyse how the diverse forms of amnesty and immunity play out in dealing with the past in Northern Ireland. Also, among transitional justice activists and policymakers, there is a growing interest in fostering public consultation and engagement with transitional justice and rule of law programmes. The proposed carefully sequenced programme of knowledge exchange and dissemination will provide a transferrable methodology and will contribute to evidence-based policymaking among international actors, and raise international awareness of the complexities of balancing immunity, truth and prosecutions.

Finally, the research team will develop their own research and professional skills through the opportunity to test theoretical insights with the Northern Irish context. In addition, they will participate in relevant training programmes offered by the universities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95999</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Healing Through Remembering</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Healing Through Remembering</gtr:description><gtr:id>A393FCC7-E309-453B-AD1C-32BAF481B21E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Kieran McEvoy, 'Dealing with the Past?

One of its key duties has been to provide formal advice to the First and Deputy First Minister on dealing with the past. Over the lifetime of the AHRC follow on project the project team have developed a close working relationship with the CVSNI including participating in a workshop and co-organising two major conferences. 1. Following an invite to address a workshop on the theme of Historical Investigations and Information Recovery that was attended by over 56 participants from across the victims' sector. Prof McEvoy presented on Amnesties, Prosecutions and the Public Interest (14 February 2013). Following very positive evaluations from that contribution, the Victims Commissioner invited the project team to co-organise two high profile conferences on dealing with the past (February 2014) and remedies for victims (October 2014). 2. The purpose of the conference on dealing with the past was to capture a range of views from groups and individuals. It was designed as a consultative event, with the feedback and views from delegates being used by the Commission to inform this advice. There were 251 individual delegates at the conference from across the victims and survivors sector including groups and service deliverers, statutory agencies, members of the Victims and Survivors Forum and individuals. McEvoy delivered a plenary address at the conference critiquing the content of the Haass proposals and members of the project team led workshops on truth (Mallinder), reparations (Moffett), acknowledgment (McEvoy), and justice (Anthony). Each of these sessions was facilitated by mediators from Healing Through Remembering. The conference was given widespread media coverage. In addition, organised a separate post-conference briefing dinner for the negotiating teams for the five parties in the Northern Ireland Executive participating in talks on dealing with the past as well as representatives from the British and Irish governments. 3. The subsequent advice given by the Commission to OFMDFM drew heavily on the team's contributions. 4. In October 2014 the project team with co-organised another major conference with the CVSNI entitled 'Remedying the Past, Healing for the Future'. One of the teams which emerged as unaddressed from the previous events was the issue of reparations for victims. This conference aimed to encourage an informed discussion around how tangible measures could be used to improve the quality of life for victims and survivors. The keynote speech was delivered by Ant&amp;ocirc;nio Augusto Can&amp;ccedil;ado Trindade, a Brazilian judge at the International Court of Justice, former President and judge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and a professor of international law. Judge Can&amp;ccedil;ado Trindade is widely acknowledged as the jurist who has done most to advance international law in this field. The conference also included input from the project team, victims and survivors from across the political spectrum and local practitioners working on dealing with past. The conference was attended by 150 persons and was covered in the local print and broadcast media. A panel in the morning brought together local practitioners to highlight issues affecting victims and survivors and to discuss appropriate remedies for dealing with the past. An afternoon workshop enabled conference participants to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of material and symbolic reparations; the kind of remedies that could be appropriate for Northern Ireland and the potential role for apologies and acknowledgement. This discussion informed a panel session after lunch, where conference attendees engaged in a conversation with academics on the experiences of remedies in other locations and their applicability to Northern Ireland.

We had initially planned to hold 20 of these meetings but we considerably exceeded this target. From late November 2012 to the end of December 2013, we held a total of 35 private briefings with key local stakeholders, including 27 with local civil society groups, criminal justice agencies, victim organisations, ex-prisoner groups, government departments, and representatives of the Irish government. These meetings culminated in seven further private bilateral meetings with the main political parties, the Haass-O'Sullivan team, senior representatives from the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office. Many of these meetings coincided with the unsuccessful negotiations surrounding the Panel of the Parties of the Northern Ireland Executive negotiations on parades, flags and dealing with the past. However, such meetings and briefings continued in 2014 following the failure of those discussions to reach agreement.

These meetings were useful for disseminating our findings from our previous research project, building and deepening relationships with key stakeholders, enhancing the project team's understanding of how our theoretical concepts apply within Northern Ireland and of the practical challenges faced by those working on dealing with the past in this region. In addition to enhancing knowledge of all participants, these private briefings fed into the other aspects of the project. For example, 1. Questions asked in the briefings helped to us identify the issues to explore in the written project outputs (i.e. blogs, op-eds and reports) 2. Helped to build relationships that encouraged the project participants to participate in the public events 3. Through these private meetings we were able to build momentum that enable us to have broad access across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland. For example, following meeting the project team, the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officers Association encouraged Unionist politicians that they should also meet the team.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e348b6c1075.08510655</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog: Amnesties, Prosecutions and Victims' Right to Justice</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3B4405D1-D695-41F2-9385-8A29C19FB45E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The second in a series of three blogs analysing the relationship of amnesties and prosecutions to the rights of victims of gross violations of human rights.

The talk drew upon the report produced by this project and sparked considerable discussion afterwards.

The conference was attended by 150 delegates including representations of the British and Irish governments, Northern Ireland government departments, civil society groups and victims. In his remarks to conclude the conference, the COE High Rights Commissioner said he had learnt a lot from the presentation on amnesties and he reiterated several of the key points from the presentation.

His lecture was entitled 'Truth, Justice &amp;amp; Reconciliation: Dealing with the Past in Northern Ireland'.

He began by providing a brief analysis of the background to conflict in Northern Ireland and the development of the Peace Process in the course of the last two decades.

The main body of the lecture then set current attempts to 'Deal with the Past' in context - looking in turn at 'critical junctures' such as the Good Friday Agreement, the Consultative Group on the Past, the Haass-O'Sullivan negotiations and, more recently, the Stormont House Agreement.

In the final analysis he spoke to wider themes concerning justice, truth and reconciliation and concluded with consideration of the political will, resources, legal imagination and tenacity required to deliver a sustainable 'deal' on 'dealing with the past'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8589cbc8fd0.65264876</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://campioncollege.ca/academics/nash-memorial-lecture-series/nash-memorial-lectures/36th-annual-nash-memorial-lecture</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Response piece on submission to Haass negotiations on models of truth recovery: Slugger O'Toole blog (19 Dec 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E515A22-43FA-4EAE-96D3-12A856F33695</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our submission to the Haass negotiations on models of truth recovery led to this response authored by Brian Walker, 'On Dealing with the Past, A Hard Sell on Impunity should not rule out cooperation with historians', Slugger O'Toole blog (19 Dec 2013)

The purpose of the event was to solicit views from these stakeholders to transmit to the negotiation teams in the Havana peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrillas. Mallinder was invited to present on Northern Ireland in order to encourage reflection on in best practice and challenges faced by a democratic states seeking to pursue transitional justice. The presentation sparked considerable discussion during the panel and afterwards during the conference.

After Mallinder's talk, she was invited to private meetings with the transitional justice team in the Office of the President, the transitional justice team in the Ministry of Justice, and the Director of Public Prosecution Strategies in the Fiscalia. These meetings provided an opportunity for key local actors in Colombia to ask more focused questions on the Northern Ireland experience. These meetings have been followed by correspondence. In addition, following the conference, the organisers requested a copy of Mallinder's presentation to distribute.

Over 120 women attended the event. The presentation was well-received and was followed by questions and requests that the slides be distributed. It also received favourable coverage in the Irish News newspaper (see Fionnuala O'Connor, 'Fumbles and Fury help &amp;quot;disguise&amp;quot; letters truth' Irish News (4 Mar 2014)). In this article, the journalist recounted the following: 'In a lively Belfast conference last Saturday (feebly chaired by me) organised by the Women's Resource and Development Agency to discover &amp;quot;what women think&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;Haass-O'Sullivan&amp;quot;, what was clearest was their diversity, that many felt left out, but also baffled. The star was youthful Dr Louise Mallinder, of the UU's transitional Justice Institute, with a jargon-free version of the proposals. It felt mean to be the reminder that they are now shelved. But the OTRs didn't feature.'

The presentation led to an invitation to write an op-ed for Open Democracy on the Haass-O'Sullivan proposals as part of a series on women in peace building. It also led to an invitation to a private meeting with the North South Secretariat.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a814af26c55.99282297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.wrda.net/Documents/HaassOSullivanWorkshopReport.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mallinder interview with NVTV for legislation project (2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19E5E2DF-CCE9-449D-A0F4-6869748EB06D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mallinder recorded television interview with NVTV on the launch of the Model Bill to implement the Stormont House Agreement.

One of its key duties has been to provide formal advice to the First and Deputy First Minister on dealing with the past. Over the lifetime of the AHRC follow on project the project team have developed a close working relationship with the CVSNI including participating in a workshop and co-organising two major conferences. 1. Following an invite to address a workshop on the theme of Historical Investigations and Information Recovery that was attended by over 56 participants from across the victims' sector. Prof McEvoy presented on Amnesties, Prosecutions and the Public Interest (14 February 2013). Following very positive evaluations from that contribution, the Victims Commissioner invited the project team to co-organise two high profile conferences on dealing with the past (February 2014) and remedies for victims (October 2014). 2. The purpose of the conference on dealing with the past was to capture a range of views from groups and individuals. It was designed as a consultative event, with the feedback and views from delegates being used by the Commission to inform this advice. There were 251 individual delegates at the conference from across the victims and survivors sector including groups and service deliverers, statutory agencies, members of the Victims and Survivors Forum and individuals. McEvoy delivered a plenary address at the conference critiquing the content of the Haass proposals and members of the project team led workshops on truth (Mallinder), reparations (Moffett), acknowledgment (McEvoy), and justice (Anthony). Each of these sessions was facilitated by mediators from Healing Through Remembering. The conference was given widespread media coverage. In addition, organised a separate post-conference briefing dinner for the negotiating teams for the five parties in the Northern Ireland Executive participating in talks on dealing with the past as well as representatives from the British and Irish governments. 3. The subsequent advice given by the Commission to OFMDFM drew heavily on the team's contributions. 4. In October 2014 the project team with co-organised another major conference with the CVSNI entitled 'Remedying the Past, Healing for the Future'. One of the themes, which emerged as unaddressed from the previous events, was the issue of reparations for victims. This conference aimed to encourage an informed discussion around how tangible measures could be used to improve the quality of life for victims and survivors. The keynote speech was delivered by Ant&amp;ocirc;nio Augusto Can&amp;ccedil;ado Trindade, a Brazilian judge at the International Court of Justice, former President and judge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and a professor of international law. Judge Can&amp;ccedil;ado Trindade is widely acknowledged as the jurist who has done most to advance international law in this field. The conference also included input from the project team, victims and survivors from across the political spectrum and local practitioners working on dealing with past. The conference was attended by 150 persons and was covered in the local print and broadcast media. Following the conference the Commission will be working closely with the project team to produce a comprehensive conference report.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a53149bbb51.37882524</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cvsni.org/index.php/media-centre/news/318-remedying-the-past-healing-for-the-future</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to the Proposed Agreement on Parades, Flags and Contending with the Past</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>85FA1029-10D7-4CD2-979C-0B494029DC37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In July 2013, the five political parties in the Northern Ireland Executive established a Panel of the Parties to consider how to resolve contestations over parades, flags and dealing with the past. The Panel invited Ambassador Richard Haass to Chair the Panel and Meghan O'Sullivan to be the Vice-Chair. The Panel was tasked with delivering recommendations to the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister by the end of December 2013. To assist them in this task, the Panel initiated a public consultation process. Following the creation of the Panel, the project team 1. Submitted a 20 page consultation document outlining the project and activities to date, provided legal analysis on the key challenges related questions of amnesty, truth recovery and prosecutions in dealing with the past. 2. Met with the Vice-Chair and staff and continued to brief throughout the negotiations. The mediation team did not have their legal advisers and so relied heavily on local expertise. 3. Throughout the negotiation process, the project team met with the negotiating team from each of the parties offering technical advice, responding to questions and providing follow up papers (on condition that these would be made available to all parties and the general public on our project website) 4. Following requests by the mediators, civil society groups (including the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officers Association) and a number of the political parties, McEvoy and Mallinder produced a paper outlining a series of models on the relationship between amnesties, truth and prosecutions. One of these models proposed 'limited immunity' in exchange for offenders engaging in truth recovery. Drawing on UK public law and the privilege against self-incrimination in the conduct of public inquiries, this model sought to relocate the debate away from international transitional justice discourses to British legal tradition which is more palatable to political Unionism. This proposal was ultimately adopted by all of the parties in the Haass negotiations and appeared in the final draft agreement. This was not the issue that ultimately led to the Unionist parties rejecting the agreement. 5. The project team also engaged extensively with local, national and international broadcast and print media. For example, the largest circulating newspaper in Northern Ireland printed a front page, two-page spread and supportive editorial outlining the models produced by McEvoy and Mallinder. Following this news story breaking the two Unionist parties confirmed for the first time that they were willing to countenance such a mechanism. The other three parties involved in the negotiations were already on the record of favouring versions of amnesty or immunity. Although the draft agreement (which went through seven iterations) does not cite any secondary sources or submissions, it has been confirmed by a number of political parties, the British Government (Northern Ireland Office Legacy Unit), and the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs that the section of the agreement relating to limited immunity was taken from our second submission outlining models for truth, amnesties and prosecutions - the subject matter for the AHRC follow on funding. Despite the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party stating that the agreement was 90 per cent secured, both Unionist parties ultimately rejected the draft agreement apparently, primarily on issues related to the flags and marching. The team continued to brief the political parties in the wake of the collapse of the talks. For example, after co-organising (with the Commission for Victims and Survivors) a major conference on dealing with the past, the team organised a separate post-conference briefing dinner for the negotiating teams for the five parties as well as representatives from the British and Irish governments. Negotiations recommenced in October 2014 and the two governments have confirmed that the elements previously agreed in the Haass-O'Sullivan process are the starting point for the current round of talks. The team recommenced briefings with the senior staff in the Northern Ireland Office Legacy Unit and the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs to coincide with the talks recommencing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a179680dd97.99201819</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/haass.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66BE990C-7CFB-4DBE-95D9-E49C03B2D67D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigations, Prosecutions and Amnesties Under Articles 2 &amp;amp;
