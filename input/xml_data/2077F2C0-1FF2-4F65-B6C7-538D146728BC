The individual cells are enclosed in a fatty sheath called a membrane. Communication between cells and the import of nutrients into, and export of products and waste products from, cells is dependent on proteins embedded within this fatty sheath. The activity of these proteins is often important in disease. For example, resistance of cancers to chemotherapy, which causes many thousands of premature deaths in the UK, is associated with the membrane protein P-gp. It pumps drugs out of cancer cells and so confers resistance. A second membrane protein, CD36, is known to bind lipids circulating in the blood causing fatty deposits in the arteries which can lead to heart disease. We aim to understand how these proteins work, and how their activities are regulated. This understanding should help us overcome the problem of drug resistance in cancer treatment and help to avoid heart disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Groups primary focus is the mechanisms of multidrug resistance in cancers, and the role of membranes and membrane proteins in cell signalling. Our studies fall into 4 general areas:||1. Structure and function of P-gp. P-gp is an ABC transporter which pumps chemotherapeutic drugs out of cells and confers resistance. Key objectives will be to determine the 3-D structure of P-gp by x-ray crystallography, and analyse drug binding sites and conformational changes by site-directed mutagenesis and high-resolution biochemical methods.||2. Regulation of P-gp expression. P-gp expression can be regulated through changes in mRNA stability and translation and this can potentially be expolited in the clinic. We will elucidate the mechanisms of post-transcriptional control and their relevance to the clinical emergence of drug resistance.||3. Regulation of P-gp activity and its role in cell physiology. Specifically, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which P-gp activity is regulated by P2X7 activation and investigate the putative role of P-gp and other transporters in lipid and membrane trafficking, and membrane lipids in cell signalling.||4. Structure and function of CD36. CD36 is a multispecific receptor present on the plasma membrane of a select but diverse variety of cells inluding macrophage, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. It binds and facilitates the uptake of long chain fatty acids, oxidised LDL, apoptotic cells, lipopolysaccharide and red cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum, and so is important in both lipid metabolism (with implications for atherosclerotic heart disease and the metabolic syndrome), and the innate immune response (where it is associated with endotoxic shock and malaria). Key objectives in the study of CD36 are the determination of the structure of the protein by X-ray crystallography to determine how the protein binds such diverse ligands and elucidation of the role of secondary modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation on the cellular biology of the protein.||Note: This group closed on 31/03/2007 but incurred some residual costs in 2007/08</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1998-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2354181</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U120074315</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
