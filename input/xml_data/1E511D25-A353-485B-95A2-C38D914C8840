Ion channels are proteins located in cell membranes that are responsible for controlling nerve impulses, muscle contractions, beating of the heart, function of the senses and the physiological activity of many other cells and tissues. Based at Granta Park, Cambridge, Metrion is an international leader in methods of measuring the function of ion channels in health and disease.

As part of its proprietary research, Metrion has identified small molecule inhibitors of a particular potassium channel known as Kv1.3 involved in auto-immune conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Recent research suggests that potent and selective inhibitors of this channel may also be effective in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) The grant will enable Metrion to explore the potential of its Kv1.3 inhibitors to treat MS using human T-cell models of the disease and to develop improved compounds that can be administered orally and are optimised to penetrate into brain and nerve tissues affected by MS.

If successful, this grant funded project will enable Metrion to pioneer the development of oral medicines with the potential to change the underlying causes of progressive MS. Current treatments for MS predominantly provide symptomatic relief of the relapsing/remitting phase of the disease but do not alter the progressive, debilitating nature of MS. Nevertheless, current approved medicines for MS have annual sales of approximately $22bn. Metrion's approach has the potential to fulfil an unmet need and improve treatment by radically modifying and slowing the progression of disability and cognitive decline, making MS more manageable for the patient and carer and cost effective to treat.

Metrion's management team and advisors have extensive experience in ion channel research, neuroscience drug discovery and medicinal chemistry, and have a successful track record in delivering new drug molecules to the clinic. Through this grant Metrion will exploit its drug discovery expertise to identify small molecule inhibitors of potassium channels which have been linked to neurodegeneration. Further modification of these lead molecules will allow the generation of orally active disease modifying agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on progressive MS. There are currently no effective disease modifying agents available for the progressive form of the disease and MS remains a debilitating diseases for many thousands of patients.&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139989</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">133481</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
