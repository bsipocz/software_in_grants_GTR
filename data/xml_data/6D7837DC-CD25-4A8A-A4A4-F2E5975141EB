Is there life elsewhere? The academy builds on our highly successful 2013 pilot scheme.

The summer school is split into two weeks. One week is for teachers and one week is for students. In this proposal to STFC, we seek funding for just the teacher segment of the academy. The aims of the academy during this week are as follows:

&amp;gt; Expose teachers to researchers and the excitement of taking part in real science.
&amp;gt; Give teachers ideas in astrobiology and interdisciplinary science that can be incorporated into lesson plans and the national curriculum.
&amp;gt; Develop focused, fully integrated lesson plans that can be transplanted directly from the academy to the school environment, thus achieving national impact.
&amp;gt; Building a cadre of astrobiology teachers that can work with us in the future in advancing astrobiology teaching in the UK.

The legacy of this project will be to generate new lesson plans that will aid in delivering national curriculum, specifically using astrobiology to teach information across interdisciplinary boundaries, where some of the world's major questions and challenges lie (e.g. climate change, resource limitation). We see astrobiology as a vehicle for teaching wider ideas in science, communication and collaborative working through teachers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The lesson plans we create are to be first tested in the schools from which our selected teachers come from. Then they will be available nationally. We plan to make them available through a wide diversity of outlets, including National Science Learning Centres, NASA Astrobiology Institute, our own web site. One responsibility of teacher involvement with the academy is that they have an active role after the academy in the transmission and implementation of lesson plans.

Our overall academy structure is openly available to others. We expect that our experience will aid others in planning astrobiology outreach opportunities.

Our evaluation data will be available to other people running teaching training schools and academies and similar ventures elsewhere through our web site.

The academy structure, experiences, evaluation data and any other information of use to dissemination will all be made available on the academy web site (www.astrobiologyacademy.org). This will be our chief tool for dissemination. 

We have also established a very successful web book page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/481206838624119/ which is open to all teachers and students on the academy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8535</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Astrobiology Summer Academy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B476544A-52D5-408E-8DEF-929E98B871D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity is about bringing secondary school teachers together to write lesson plans and make them available for secondary school teaching in astrobiology using astrobiology to teach science subjects across a range of disciplines.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>573b37298612d5.72573680</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The academy has produced new lesson plans that are being used in secondary schools across the UK.
