Hong Kong has been a major source of such referencing by virtue of its strong performance on international tests of pupil achievement. Using Hong Kong as a case study,&amp;nbsp; the project will analyse external policy referencing, with England as the ?borrower? and Hong Kong the ?lender?. The aim is to cast a light on the role of external policy referencing in the policy making process, and how policy referencing is operationalised in the England context. The study provides an insight into the contemporary patterns of external policy referencing, and its manifestation in the West and East Asia, and examines the evidence used to inform the process.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will undertake a literature review and interviews with stakeholders in both contexts to address the following research questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What have been the critical features of the patterns of external policy referencing in England since the 1990s?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How have policy makers in England interpreted the sources of success of Hong Kong?s education system, and how does this compare with the views of key stakeholders in Hong Kong?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Major education reforms have been proposed based on claims as to what works in 'high performing' education systems. For example, recent proposals in England premised on what 'works' in East Asia have included a reform of the National Curriculum and examination systems, a restructuring of teacher education towards more accelerated and school-based systems, and an increase in school autonomy. If implemented, these reforms will have a major impact on various stakeholders, including examination boards, teacher educators, schools, parents, and pupils. Other stakeholders include those more directly engaged in policy making, viz. government officials, political parties, civic groups, and other groups involved in policy advocacy.

At the same time, the public debate is dominated by an international network of consultancies and think tanks (e.g. the McKinsey consulting company, and the Pearson education group) that promote education reform based on their interpretation of comparative data drawn from international tests of pupil achievement. 
However, the process of external policy referencing is akin to a black hole because stakeholders lack familiarity with the various 'high performing' systems that are cited. In addition, the international data on which reform is advocated is vast, and open to multiple interpretations. Consequently, the capacity of stakeholders to evaluate the advocated proposals is very limited. Therefore, by subjecting the process of policy advocacy and borrowing to critical scrutiny, we will demonstrate the extent to which the claims made are valid inferences from the evidence.

The need for such scrutiny is indicated in the recent response to a journal article written by the Principal Investigator (Morris 2012) which queried many of the claims about overseas education systems made by 2010 Education White Paper in England. This is currently the most downloaded article in the journal published this year. This interest has led the British Education Research Association to commission the Principal Investigator to write an opinion piece for their publication Research Intelligence. In addition, key stakeholders - such as assessment agencies, who believe that their role will be substantially affected by the implementation of the advocated reforms - have also expressed an interest in the writings of the Principal Investigator, and have requested talks/ seminars by him, and sought advice from him.

Our study therefore has the potential to inform academic debates in both comparative education and national policy analysis. It will also make a significant contribution to the various stakeholders who contribute to, and are affected by, education reform, but do not have the expertise to evaluate or assess the claims that underpin these reforms.

To maximise the impact of our research, we will set up reference and contact groups. The reference group will provide input in the research process and the dissemination of the findings. It will meet twice during the life of the project, and comprise academics, members of high commissions, political advisers (especially those involved in select committee work), and key journalists. The contact group will comprise potential beneficiaries. As the project progresses, we will identify the significant findings and the main beneficiaries, and communicate the former to the latter.

We will engage with stakeholders in two stakeholders' workshops. The first will be held mid-point into the project, and obtain feedback from stakeholders on the initial findings, the impact on them, as well as the project itself. At the second, we will disseminate the overall findings, and seek the views of the stakeholders as to how the findings can be used to benefit them and other stakeholders. In addition, we will also offer to present our findings to interested stakeholders at their organisation, and will publicise our findings through releases, summaries, and reports to the media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70562</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International comparative education conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C35C37C0-6AD9-43E4-A1ED-4CDFA4A8F177</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper '&amp;quot;Did it just get darker in here?&amp;quot;: casting shadows, searching for prospects', was presented by project Research Officer Euan Auld on 9 Mar 2016, at the annual international Comparative and International Education Conference 2016 in Vancouver.

Thus for example the move to ensure schools have greater autonomy by creating more academies and Free Schools is premised on the claim that this is a feature of high performing education systems in East Asia. Claims such as these are promulgated by the Government itself and various consultancies (especially McKinsey) who specialise in identifying 'international best practices' and cross national agencies such as the OECD, which has become a major source of policy advocacy. The tendency to rely on such sources of 'evidence' has been facilitated by the hollowing out of the professional civil service which previously undertook such comparisons and/or interpreted them. Amongst the key findings are:
(i) the data the government draws on is portrayed as a form of evidence-based policy making, but in practice the process is highly selective and designed to support their own ideological preferences; 
(ii) many of the claims as to the features of high performing systems elsewhere are in marked contrast to how local stakeholders perceive the features of their own education systems; 
(iii) the overall direction/goals of education policy in England is in marked contrast to that of high performing East Asian systems; 
(iv) there are major differences in the processes/approach used to implement educational reforms in East Asia compared to England, and these are largely ignored in the literature which focusses on the products of reform; 
(v) the many claims which are made as to why educational systems are successful are based on very weak assumptions and not able to establish causality: they rely on a combination of assertions, inferences and correlations; 
(vi) the industry which claims to identify 'best practice' from comparative data has developed a complex and sophisticated set of strategies to promote its claims which effectively mask their capacity to establish causality; 
(vii) the real strength in Hong Kong (our main site for researching policy-referencing) lies in its curriculum development processes and support for implementation, and this has been overlooked by policy makers.

An important new research question that has been opened up concerns the architecture and process of education policy making in England, the changes to these over the years, and the implications of these changes for education policy making. This is an area of research that the team would like to explore next. We are also working on a project designed to analyse in detail the ways in which the global policy advocacy industry, which now dominates education policy making operates.

A very good relationship was established with the partner at Hong Kong Institute of Education (now Educational University of Hong Kong), Principal Investigator Professor Bob Adamson. This relationship has continued through jointly written journal articles and conference presentations. The England and Hong Kong teams are exploring the possibility of future collaborations. 

In terms of capacity building, the project involved two doctoral students at IOE and one EdD student at the University of Bristol, each of whom were engaged on related research topics. All three have successfully completed their doctorates, and the project provided an invaluable opportunity for them to both utilise new sources of data and develop their research skills. The research theme which this project explored is now continuing within IOE as a number of doctoral students have been attracted by the project, and are focussing on research related to policy borrowing in other contexts, specifically, Germany, Sweden and the Gulf States. 

The England and Hong Kong teams presented the findings at a symposium at the Houses of Parliament hosted by Barry Sheerman MP, and discussed the results with members of the opposition, the leaders of the recent Review of the National Curriculum and HEFCE. We have also published the results and provided seminars/talks in Singapore, Hong Kong, the US, Canada, Macao, Cambridge and London. We are continuing to publish from the findings of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results have implications for the ways in which education policy is promoted and justified.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CF0375CE-D15A-4793-AFB2-5B7ACC70F16E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7ea0d4ed61.48803829</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Possible influence with regard to the decision that England should not participate in the Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes (AHELO): In 2015, I was consulted by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) with regard to whether England should participate in AHELO.
