Whilst a minority have worked in 'above-the-line' roles (directors, costume designers), thousands have been employed in 'below-the-line' roles as hairdressers, continuity 'girls', production assistants, and negative cutters, yet their history has barely been studied. Much of their work has been undervalued by academic scholarship which has privileged auteur-directors, and its study hampered by scarce archival sources. This research project looks at the historical relations between women &amp;amp; production by exploring women's contribution through ACT/T trade union records and oral history testimony. From 1933-89 film &amp;amp; commercial TV operated as a closed shop and BBC employment was similarly regulated. By tracing women's contribution through union membership this project will provide empirical data about how many women worked in the industries, their roles and their movement between film/TV. This data will be supplemented by oral history interviews with women which explore their working lives. In bringing these two approaches together this project will unlock previously hidden evidence about women's work, and develop new ways of conceptualising and historicising the film/TV industries through the experiences of below-the-line workers. This will have a wider impact on both the study of film/TV and our understanding of the role of women in 20thC creative arts/industries. 
This 3.5-year project has 2 key parts. Part 1, based at the Universities of Newcastle &amp;amp; Sunderland, is led by the PI (Dr Melanie Bell) and CI (Dr Vicky Ball) and comprises a Research Associate (RA), a PhD, a major conference and papers, union training workshops, a website, an oral history project, and a monograph. The PhD will use historical union data to survey women in a chosen industry grade (e.g. producer, editor), and use written, oral &amp;amp; visual evidence from films to produce a number of case studies which analyse women's contributions to the field, thus extending our knowledge of women's work. The conference will draw together academics, archivists, TV/film industry personnel, and policy-makers to explore how long-established working practices have shaped the various dimensions of women's employment in the industries. The RA will lead the oral history component, recording interviews with 25 women, prioritising grades where few historical records remain e.g. make-up, wardrobe, continuity. The interview material will be hosted on a project website and used in BECTU union training workshops with current industry practitioners. The final project outcome (yr 3.5) will be a monograph by the PI/CI which analyses gender and production culture in ACT/T's 3 branches (Film Production, Laboratory, TV) and the BBC, assesses women's campaigning activities (ACTT Equality Committee) and provides case studies of women's work in Costume, Make-Up and Scriptwriting. Part 2, sub-contracted to the British Universities Film &amp;amp; Video Council, will produce a database of ACT/T union membership application data under agreement with the film/TV union, now named BECTU. Whilst the project team will work specifically on women's grades &amp;amp; pay, the database will hold membership application data for both women &amp;amp; men (67,000 apps. in total) ensuring its future potential as a major digital resource for other researchers. Published in yr 3 it will be hosted on a contextual website containing case studies &amp;amp; oral history material and maintained by the BUFVC beyond the life of the project. By bringing into clearer focus the historical gendering of working patterns &amp;amp; production cultures the project's findings will benefit academics/students of film/TV/gender/labour history, and provide a body of evidence which industry personnel/policy-makers may draw upon to intervene in current policy/practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The first area of impact comes from the project's partnership with BECTU. The BUFVC project website and its digitised resources (ACT/T membership application data, oral histories interviews) will make a major contribution to the history of women's work in the production of film and television. BECTU will also benefit from the oral history learning resource developed by the project for use in union training sessions and workshops, which will prompt discussion amongst its members about equality and diversity. This output has significant impact potential which will be measured through workshop participant feedback and BECTU-administered questionnaires in subsequent years. The RA will publish a self-reflexive account of methodology, of interest to trainers/oral historians in other subject-specific contexts. 

Secondly, the materials housed on the BUFVC website (searchable database, application data, oral histories, case studies, self-reflexive report on database design and research methodology, and PhD self-reflexive diary) will be of use to archivists, users of media archives, industry workers, their representative bodies and the general public, beyond the scope and life-span of this project. The self-reflexive report on research methodology will suggest alternative ways of using the database and digitised application forms. The PhD's self-reflexive diary will provide a toolkit for researchers and students. Both research outputs will benefit researchers across a number of disciplines (see outputs &amp;amp; academic beneficiaries). 

Thirdly, findings from the project will be used for advocacy purposes at events organised by industry groups Women in Film &amp;amp; TV (WFTV) &amp;amp; Skillset. They will be used in three main ways: 
1. to raise awareness and promote discussion of equality and diversity practice;
2. to promote women's contributions to film and television production;
3. to raise new expectations and point to new career aspirations for girls/young women. 

The fourth output designed to engage potential beneficiaries with the research is the project conference (July 2016) which has four panels targeting the industry, archival and academic sectors: 
1. The 'Women &amp;amp; Industry' panel will highlight the relevance of our historical study to the current context and women's position therein. The research and findings from our project will be able to historicise/contextualise findings and trends identified in post-1995 government commissioned reports. The conference will be a crucial forum to bring together representatives from government and industry who have a vested interest in equal opportunities; DCMS, Skillset, BFI, Arts Council, BBC, ITV and CH 4, as well as workers themselves and their representative groups (WFTV &amp;amp; BECTU). 
2. The 'Women &amp;amp; Work' panel will celebrate and debate women's creative contributions to film/TV, past and present, by inviting a cross-generational panel of women to discuss their work and working practices. 
3. The 'Women &amp;amp; the Unions' panel will feature representatives from BECTU's Equality Committee (past and present), their training team, and their Young Persons Forum to speak about the union's relationship to equality and diversity issues, and debate future pathways. 
4. The 'Women &amp;amp; the Archives' panel will invite representatives from national/regional film and TV archives, company archives such as Granada and curators, librarians and researchers. The panel will address future pathways to enable the education, research and preservation of materials related to women's film/TV history.
The project's conference will therefore provide a stimulus, in terms of impact, to policy-makers and industry groups, women workers, BECTU, archivists and researchers to debate the key issues relating to women's work in film and television production (both past, present and future) and, via the project website and media publicity, bring the project and the issues it raises to wider public attention.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>133443</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Women's Work in the British Film and TV Industries', BFI Education Conference, BFI Southbank, 3rd July 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A8CB786-64EC-4003-9BDF-CA46855BDE7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation and discussion by Dr Vicky Ball (CI) on the topic of women's media histories to FE teachers at the BFI Education Conference, BFI Southbank, which showcases new/emerging research and shares ideas about working with students in film and media studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7bb31c39aa8.44582443</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BECTU Women's Committee, Workshop follow-up questionnaire at 6 months</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A005D41E-648A-4B9B-85E0-F2E66787FB52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A follow-up on-line questionnaire was sent to the 50 delegates who participated in the BECTU Women's Committee conference in 2015 at which the PI and RA delivered a listening workshop on gender, feminism and women's work in the media industries. From those 50 delegates, a survey was sent to 26 who had agreed to be participated for further follow-up. 9 responses were received. This questionnaire asked questions designed to measure longer-term impact, for example had there been any change in thinking or practice on the topic of gender equality &amp;amp; the media industries as a result of the workshop. Half of the respondents reported change with a varying degrees of level and scope. Some reported changes in levels of awareness, others that the workshop had confirmed what they suspected but they felt more empowered to challenge discrimination and galvanised to agitate for change within the industry. Challenging negative recruitment strategies, behaviours, values and stereotypes expressed by work colleagues took place at an individual level and took the form of 'calling someone out' or arguing to get a highly qualified women recruited into their department. Other respondents challenged their energies into greater involvement with the trade union as a vehicle for change. Respondents reported the workshop had had a longer-lasting motivating impact and had been instrumental in them building resilience to tackle discrimination.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b9747b2e71.76594306</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Women and Sound workshop, British Film Institute, May 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5A21591-89B4-49C2-86CF-6281F047B60E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sixty participants attended a Women and Sound in the British film &amp;amp; television event at the BFI Southbank.

The suite of oral history interviews comprises over one hundred and forty hours of recorded interview material with a range of industry professionals (all women).
