Although Naqab women have played (and continue to play) a crucial role in their community's struggle against Israeli settler-colonial policies, their historical accounts have so far received little attention. Failing to understand that 'the personal is political,' mainstream historiography often misrepresents women as politically inactive, and their accounts as irrelevant, apolitical, or even factually incorrect. 

Based on ca. 100 video- and audio-recorded oral testimonies of Naqab women (collected by the PI and a local assistant during 8 months fieldwork) this project proposes a gendered 'history from below' of the Naqab Bedouin as an alternative to official (largely archive-based) Israeli historiography, as well as other male and elite-dominated master-narratives. Doing so, it contributes to emerging 'indigenous' oral history projects on the Naqab (e.g. Nsasra, 2010), and the broader work of Israeli revisionist historians (Papp&amp;eacute;, 1988; Shlaim, 1988). Preserving oral testimonies is crucial: survivors of the Nakba, i.e. witnesses of the 1948 expulsion, are becoming few. Given that Naqab Bedouin culture is largely based on orality, the life stories, historical narratives and cultural knowledge of elderly Bedouin women are likely to be lost, if not recorded now. 
 
The collected data will be analysed through the theoretical lens of settler colonialism. Israeli control relies on the continuous elimination/resettlement of the indigenous population, and re-inhabitation of the land with Israeli settlers (e.g. Yiftachel, 2008). Following recent theorising on gender and settler colonialism (Settler Colonial Studies, 2012b), this study proposes that Israeli military, sedentarisation, modernisation, transfer and other settler-colonial policies have transformed local gender norms and practices. Such a heoretical frame warrants comparison with Palestinian women's activism in the West Bank, which - like Naqab Bedouin's - takes place within and against varying forms of settler colonialism. This comparative analysis, which relies on secondary literature and original fieldwork data collected by the PI during her PhD research in the West Bank, will contribute insights to the burgeoning theorising in the field of gender and settler colonialism.

The recordings will be preserved in the physical and virtual Negev Bedouin Heritage Archive, leaving a local legacy, strengthening the community's cultural, political and historical consciousness, and serving as a widely accessible resource for the general public. Additional outcomes include a documentary film, a community-oriented workshop in the Naqab, two academic/policy-oriented workshops in the UK and US (involving Amnesty International, UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues), an international academic conference (leading to an edited volume of Nomadic Peoples Journal), a monograph, and a journal article.

Based at Exeter University under the mentorship of Prof. Papp&amp;eacute;, the project contributes to the European Centre for Palestine Studies' work on Naqab Bedouins and oral history. In 2010 the PI co-organised the first international conference on the Naqab Bedouins (proceedings to be published by Routledge) and recently Prof. Papp&amp;eacute; won an AHRC grant on &amp;quot;A Common Archive for 1948 Palestine.&amp;quot; The project also relies on intensive international cooperation in the Naqab (Rahat Center for Young Adults and NGO Step Forward), and in the US (Center for Palestine Studies, Columbia University). 

Proposing a methodology new to this context (feminist oral history) to research an understudied empirical field (the Naqab) from a novel theoretical lens (gender and settler colonialism), the project will make important contributions to gender, settler-colonial, Palestine and broader Middle East studies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project engages different non-academic stakeholders: 1) the local Naqab Bedouin community, 2) international development practitioners and policy-makers, 3) the broader public (particularly Palestine and feminist activist groups, but also other research-interested publics).

The local community is at the heart of this project. Collecting and analysing Naqab Bedouin women's oral testimonies, the project aims at writing a 'history from below' which counters mainstream colonial and male-dominated historiography. The project relies on collaboration with the local project partner 1 (Rahat Center for Young Adults), local project partner 2 (NGO Step Forward), and two local assistants (for fieldwork and filmmaking). Other community members will be involved through participation in a local workshop on the uses of oral history for community empowerment (Impact Activity 1) and as consultant. By producing an original dataset of ca. 100 Naqab Bedouin women's oral testimonies, which will be integrated into the local Negev Bedouin Heritage Archive (Impact Activity 2, Digital Output 6), the project aims to make their voices heard and recognised by the wider public in Israel/Palestine, the UK and beyond. The Archive, through its physical and virtual space, will create a publicly accessible database, useful not only for other researchers, policy-makers, activists, journalists etc, but also for the Naqab Bedouin community itself. By creating a local legacy and resource base it can strengthen the community's historical, political and cultural consciousness, and thus its struggle against Israeli discriminatory policies for a just future. It is crucial that this Archive includes women's activism and female voices from the community.

Members of the international community, mainly US- and UK-based policy-makers, advocacy activists and development practitioners, will feed into the research process through two policy-oriented workshops in New York and London (Impact Activity 3, 4). With the adoption of the UNGA Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, the Naqab Bedouins have received increased international attention (e.g. in 2012 the UK Taskforce on Issues relating to Arab Citizens in Israel organised a study trip to the Naqab; in 2011 UK Minority Rights Group International held a panel on &amp;quot;Israel's Denial of the Bedouin&amp;quot; in the Houses of Parliament). Yet, policy-making so far has largely neglected the gendered aspects of indigenous struggles. Identifying this gap, a recent UN International Expert Group Meeting on Combating Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls (Jan 2012) called for more research on indigenous women. Responding to this call, this project aims to contribute to developing gender-sensitive policy recommendations for indigenous community's struggles for rights and recognition, focusing on its case study of Naqab women.

The general public will be reached through the Archive (see above), and a documentary film on Naqab Bedouin women's politics (Impact Activity 5, Digital Output 5). The film will engage three target audiences (mainly in the UK) with different aspects of the research: the Palestine activist community will be familiarised with the Naqab case; the feminist community with indigenous/Palestinian women's struggles against discrimination; and other research-interested publics with the broader research approach (oral history) and its key findings. The film will be shown at appropriate festivals, workshops and events. The PI will attend ca. 10 such events to facilitate discussions with the audience. Although gaining ground in legal, advocacy and policy-oriented forums, few from the general public know about the plight of Naqab Bedouins in Israel. The film aims to raise wider awareness, integrating the case of the Naqab into broader Palestine activism and motivating the general public to engage in solidarity activities for improving the situation of Naqab Bedouins, especially wome</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200441</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The project's documentary film 'Islam's Wedding...and other Bedouin Stories from the Naqab' (produced by Yiannis Kanakis) focuses on strategies of cultural endurance and resistance.

The first community-oriented workshop on oral history was held on 5 April 2014 at the Rahat Youth Centre (Markaz ash-Shabab). The workshop engaged and trained members of the local community in oral history and created a dialogue between members, scholars, and representatives of the community. It targeted specifically younger members of the community (BA and MA students) to raise their historical awareness and train them in oral history. International scholars and experts on the topic were invited to present. 

Given the strong interest which this first workshop generated a series of follow-up events on oral history in the Naqab were organised. On 26th April 2014 Ahmad Amara, New York University, gave a presentation to students on his fieldwork-based research project in the Naqab, focusing on methodological challenges.

On 21 March 2015 a study trip to Jerusalem was organised for ca. 20 Naqab Bedouin students. The students were given guided tours and lectures at the Issaf Nashashibi Center for Culture and Literature (its library, archive, and cultural center) as well as at the Palestinian Heritage Museum of Dar al-Tifel in East Jerusalem. The study trip initiated discussions, and raised interest in the possibilities and challenges of creating an oral history archive in the Naqab. 

On 9 January 2016 a panel discussion with oral historians and students who participated in the oral history workshop series was organised at the Rahat library. Participants included: Prof Mustafa Kabha (Open University), Dr Safa Aburabia (Mandel Center), Dr Mansour Nasasra (consultant), Atwa Abu Frih (Markaz ash-Shabab, Rahat), Sophie Richter-Devroe (PI), and students who had participated in the oral history workshop series and presented some of their findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ce2cf4a3746.80072769-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Administrative and logistical planning of the two events.

The workshops engaged and trained members of the local community in oral history and created a dialogue between members, scholars, and representatives of the community. It targeted specifically younger members of the community (students) to raise their historical awareness and train them in oral history. 



This was the first time that a workshop on this topic was organised in the Naqab, and it generated a lot of interest in the community. At the request of the participating students and NGOs, we (PI and consultant Mansour Nsasra) are planning future events to develop this into a oral history workshop series. 

The launch event on 5 April was attended by international scholars and experts, and was reported in the local media.

The event aimed to raise awareness and further interest among policy-makers, development practitioners and scholars on the Naqab case. The event provided a platform for local Naqab Bedouin women, in particular from the younger generation, to voice their viewpoints and bring attention to their forms of activism in the Naqab Bedouin's struggle. All speakers were prominent local activists engaged in local and international advocacy of different kinds. They provided analysis and up-to-date information of recent developments in the Bedouin land struggle since the Prawer Plan, and also brought to a wider audience the political narratives, agendas and imaginaries of a new generation of younger female Bedouin activists.

It took place on 10 April 2015 as part of a series of events on settler colonialism at Columbia University, New York. It aimed at contextualising and critically discussing the various ways in which the Naqab Bedouin have been and are being represented, paying particular attention to more recent, often claimed to be 'indigenous' or 'decolonising', discourses. Several international experts on the topic were invited and presented during the workshop. The project's documentary film was also screened and discussed. The workshop generated discussion and debate on the topic, resulted in requests for further information and future collaborations, and produced a publication of selected workshop papers in a special issue of the Journal for Holy Land and Palestine Studies (May 2016). It is documented on the Columbia and Exeter University websites, and was also reported in local Arabic-language media in the Naqab.

The local community was at the heart of this project. During several months of fieldwork the PI, local consultant and local research assistants collected original empirical material and worked to raise awareness for oral history among the community through the organisation of a series of workshops and events. Several young local scholars were trained in oral history methodology. More generally, through these initiatives and events, the local community became more familiar with and interested in oral history as a tool to strengthen historical, political and cultural consciousness. Oral history initiatives and projects are now being further developed and taken forward by the community. Among those is a collaborative scholarly publication in Arabic on oral history in the Naqab, comprising articles by the PI, project consultant, as well as scholars and students from the Naqab.

Development practitioners, policy-makers and advocacy activists were reached through a workshop jointly organised with Minority Rights Group and School of Advanced Studies in London. While, after the Prawer Plan, the Naqab case has gained attention in policy-making, development and advocacy circles, our workshop put Naqab Bedouin women's voices, which so far had received little attention, centre-stage. The workshop fostered debate, requests for further information and potential future collaborative projects. The UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee's cited the &amp;quot;The Naqab Bedouin and Colonialism: New Perspectives&amp;quot; (Routledge, 2014) in its report on The FCO's human rights work in 2013, pointing to the urgent need to address recent developments in the Naqab. 

A wider non-academic audience was reached through several public talks and other engagement activities. In particular, the screening of the project's documentary film at different festivals and public venues in Europe, the US and Turkey, as well as a photography exhibition, displayed so far in two venues in the UK, provided the general public with information about the Naqab case. At these events, the audience requested additional information on the project, on the situation in the Naqab, and on ways to get involved.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F9ADC7F5-610D-4512-8CFA-D614FEB2D9DA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cf2ca9ee6b9.87523295</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project constitutes the first in-depth English-language study of Naqab Bedouin women's historical accounts, as expressed through oral narratives and embodied performances. It is based on a large set of ethnographic material collected in several months of fieldwork in the Naqab by the PI, supported by local research assistants. During the duration of the grant (Feb 2014-Feb 2016) the project achieved its major aims of:

1) Collection and analysis of original empirical data from the Naqab, leading to academic publications. The scholarly outputs provide a 'history from below' based on so-far neglected women's voices from the community, and, as such, counter mainstream colonial and male-dominated historiography of the region.

2) Disseminating the findings to different audiences (see also impact) through:
a. Organisation of the project's three main academic and policy-oriented events: a 3-day international conference on Palestine, the Naqab and Settler Colonialism at Exeter University (October 2015), an international workshop on 'Representations of Indigeneity: the Case of the Naqab Bedouin' at Columbia University, New York (April 2015), and a policy-oriented event on the Naqab, jointly organised with Minority Rights Group and School of Advanced Studies, London (October 2015). Through these events, and the publications that result from them, the network of scholars working on the Naqab was strengthened, and the field of Critical Naqab Bedouin Studies established more firmly in Palestine, Settler Colonial and Middle East Studies. 
b. Several talks and public events, including a photography exhibition and screenings of the project's documentary film in different locations internationally. Through these events non-academic audiences were reached, raising their awareness and knowledge about the Naqab.

3) Involving the local community through a series of oral history workshops and events in the Naqab. This has raised strong interest among the community, and several follow-up projects initiated by members and organisations of the community on the topic of oral history are now under way.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The scholarly community, particularly in the field of gender studies, Palestine studies, Middle East studies, settler colonialism studies and indigenous studies, might be interested in building on the findings and arguments put forward in this research.

Policy-makers, advocacy workers and development practitioners, can benefit from the specific insights gained in this research on Naqab Bedouin women's struggles and situation.

The local community will take the oral history initiatives further, building on the awareness-raising and training undertaken in the community by the PI and consultant during this project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>47568195-66D1-42CE-913F-2BEA96F2F387</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6e8382cbf3.03014561</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and
