It will achieve this by gathering primary longitudinal data from individuals living in each of the three cities over the period 2011-2013 to see what effect, if any, the Olympics have on a comprehensive set of subjective well-being (SWB) outcomes. In particular, it will uniquely show how these outcomes relate to one another and change over time. Importantly for public policy, it will also shed light on the degree to which different components of SWB are predictive of changes in behaviour that policy-makers are concerned with (e.g. diet and physical activity). &lt;br />&lt;br />This project is innovative on a number of general scientific fronts. It is the first attempt to establish the impact of experiencing large-scale events on stated preferences from the same individuals over a number of time points and determine the direction of causality from the Olympics to intangible outcomes. Additionally, it is the first panel dataset across Europe, which includes both evaluative and experience measures of SWB and health data.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>580021</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Going for Gold: Narrative Impact

1. How have your findings been used? Please provide a brief summary. 

We have not published any academic papers or policy white papers yet. They are still being written by the project team. We have spoken in public about the project. For instance, during the World Cup in 2014 Stefan Szymanski spoke frequently with journalists about the impact of major sporting events. He argued that these events do not generate significant economic benefits but do contribute significantly to happiness. He spoke about the research at the International Sports Business Congress at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium on July 18 2014. This was reported in the Manchester Evening News. He referred to the role of happiness in sporting events in the Irish Examiner, January 3, 2013, Financial Times, January 31, 2014, Forbes, June 9, 2014, The Advertiser (Australia), July 8, 2014.

3. What types of impact have arisen from the research?

While we have not published any research yet, we see significant impact on the two areas we identified in the proposal. The first aim is directed at significant academic and policy questions relating to valuing public goods. There are many important questions in valuing the intangible effects of events and interventions. For instance, who to ask, what questions to ask, when to ask, and how you ask it, are all significant and important questions when it comes to non-market valuation for policymakers. These questions cut across many different areas and government departments, for instance environmental economics, health economics, transport economics, and sports economics. Much of the current practices at the organisational or governmental level do not take into account these issues from a holistic perspective. We hope to significantly address that at the policy level. We believe that our assessment method will have significant contributions to the assessment of smart city developments. We believe that linking to smart cities proposals holds significant opportunity given that smart cities investment will be $400bn by 2020 and that their main objective is to improve people's wellbeing. 

We also believe our research will have practical effects for planners of major sporting events, by identifying those communities which are most likely to benefit and most likely to get involved with these events. By identifying those aspects of the event that generate most interest (e.g. opening ceremonies) we believe that event planning can become more focused.
The 'science of wellbeing' and issues of relating wellbeing to public policy is obviously a recent phenomena and has involved many members of this research team. Members of this team actively help and advise the ONS of measuring wellbeing. The outcomes of this research will be directly fed into the way the ONS measures wellbeing across the UK. We have had some impact already. Our project was mentioned in a Parliamentary discussion of the &amp;quot;All-Party Parliamentary Group on Wellbeing Economics&amp;quot; in March 2013 - the event was also open to the public. We have also described the project at various other conferences and panels, such as the World Economic Forum and the panel on wellbeing at the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. We have also had discussions with Sir Robin Wales about the impacts of the Olympics in London and especially Newham since that is where he is currently Mayor. 

Our project is the first ever-comprehensive wellbeing analysis of a large event funded by a government across the World. We believe that other project developers and appraisals will adopt this wellbeing evaluation approach.
