Large laboratories with powerful optical lasers, free-electron x-ray lasers, and pulsed electrical power have rapidly expanded the extremes of pressure and temperature accessible in materials, exploring natural wonders such as exoplanets' deep interiors, pursuing new technologies such as controlled fusion, and probing the fundamental behaviour of matter at extremes. However, such facilities are rare and access often exclusive, limiting growth in this 21st century physics frontier. This project proposes to develop and apply novel table-top approaches to creating states of matter previously synthesised only in stadium-sized laboratories, or which have never before been synthesised. Using a novel combination of traditional approaches, this work will revolutionise access to extreme conditions, particularly for light elemental materials such as water and hydrogen, for which the challenge of achieving and studying extreme conditions has been particularly pronounced. At the same time, the high-pressure and high-temperature behaviour of light elements and the materials they comprise are critically important in extreme systems ranging from inertial confinement fusion reactors to giant planets and stars. Light elements also comprise archetypal physical systems ranging from the hydrogen molecule, to water, to the basic molecular building blocks of life. Many of the most fundamental questions about the behaviour of such materials lie at extreme conditions, as do many of the most practical ones. This study will overcome existing limitations in studying light elements at extremes using a handheld instrument - the diamond anvil cell - to compress samples to high density, followed by rapid heating and probing by modern optical and x-ray methods. Inexpensive and based on a widely-used instrument, the techniques developed will extend access to very extreme states in light elemental materials to the large scientific community interested in extreme conditions research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project seeks to study the properties of light element materials at extremes of pressure and temperature, to tell us more about the natural and technological systems at which these extreme states of matter occur, such as fusion energy systems and planetary interiors. 

To be able to study these materials we need ultra-fast measurements of temperature so that the changes in the temperature of the samples can be recorded and then modelled. These time resolved temperature measurements were originally developed as diagnostics for fusion energy and high-energy-density research at major facilities, but have been ingeniously adapted to smaller and cheaper laboratory set-ups.

The implementation of measuring techniques from one research area into a new one has led to the development of new technology that may be adapted to a more general use worldwide by researchers and industry, including at central research facilities in Germany, France, the UK, US, and Japan, and the laser manufacturing (peening, cutting, machining) industry. I believe that I can create and patent the machinery to measure these fast, high temperature changes and I will be able to explore the commercialisation of these diagnostic tools. This patent and the future marketing of these tools will position the UK as a leader in new technology and in the forefront of materials diagnostics. 

I will also provide opportunities for participation and training of students during the project who will help develop the prototypes, giving them practical experience in technology development to use in their future endeavours. This project thus will help shape the innovative future of the UK and support the high level training and education of its citizens.

I will develop general public engagement by presenting my results in the University of Edinburgh Doors Open Day; at the Edinburgh Science Festival; and as an Edinburgh Institute of Physics Public Lecture. I will show the laboratory set up and explain the techniques used in my experiments, explain my findings and how they contribute to our knowledge of fusion energy and the effects my results have on our day to day life. I will help policy makers better understand the value of extreme conditions research in securing our energy future, exploring our universe, and in supporting UK industry and basic research goals. I will share my findings with a non-expert public by disseminating science through media and journalists (see http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~rmcwilli/press.html for examples).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101213</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P024513/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>05CC2BB5-3B3B-49BE-8554-043DB9AE0772</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fusion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8ECC9D35-20DE-4F19-8A8A-07D65859D6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Light-Matter Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
