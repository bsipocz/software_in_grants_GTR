The firm-only data come from the Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey (MWSS). The linked employer-employee data are the Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2011 (WERS); and the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) linked to the Business Structure Database (BSD). WERS, ASHE and the MWSS will be linked to the Annual Respondents' Database (ARD to obtain measures of firm performance. The study will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;explore the reasons for the incidence and growth of PRP in Britain&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>establish the relationship between PRP and firm performance&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>consider PRP's impact on wages and the wage distribution.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The findings will be of value to firms seeking a competitive advantage through changes to their compensation structures. Results will interest policy makers who have promoted employee financial participation via tax breaks, and those concerned with the distribution of rewards from employment.This policy interest has heightened recently with public concerns about the role of bonuses in contributing to both the recent banking crisis and rising wage inequality.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172428</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Computershare</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Employee Share Plans - What's in it for your Firm?

Our findings have also been used by the media to inform the debate around performance-related pay.

Policy analysts and government economists have been most concerned to hear the answer to four questions. 

First, what role did performance pay (PP) play in the smooth running of the labour market after the financial crisis of 2008? We have been able to demonstrate that PP had a modest, albeit significant, role to play in explaining the absence of real wage growth in the first few years after the recession. We have also been able to show that PP jobs were more likely to survive the recession than comparable fixed-wage jobs, consistent with employers making use of the wage flexibility inherent in PP jobs to retain employees in hard times. This has given policy makers valuable information on the role of PP in the face of economic shocks and has led policy makers to think harder about the value of PP in the future. These considerations have been evident in discussions at workshops and seminars attended by government policy analysts and economists, and in a speech made by Martin Weale, one of the co-investigators on the project who is also a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. 

Second, policy analysts have been interested for some time to introduce more PP into public sector jobs on the assumption that this should improve the efficiency with which public services are delivered. They have therefore wanted to understand more fully how PP operates in the public sector at present, and how this differs from the private sector. We have been able to indicate the types of workers and jobs that are exposed to various types of PP in the public sector. But, perhaps more importantly, we have shown that public sector PP does not conform to theoretical expectations about how PP operates, unlike PP in the private sector. This raises important questions about how and why PP is being used in the public sector currently, and has prompted government agencies to think more carefully about their objectives for PP in the public sector. This was apparent in discussions that followed the presentations of our findings at the Office for Manpower Economics and at a special session of the economists sitting on the Independent Pay Review Bodies. 

Third, there is new interest in worker well-being and its links to organisational performance. It was therefore timely that we were able to show that PP, and the size of PP payments, are positively associated with employees' job satisfaction. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills and others within government are now interested in the value of PP as an instrument for improving worker well-being in the hope and expectation that this may improve workplace performance via improvements in worker productivity. We have been able to demonstrate that there is a positive association between the use of PP and firm profitability and productivity.

Fourth, policy makers have become increasingly concerned about the detrimental impact that wage inequality may have on economic performance. We have been able to show that, in contrast to one study for the United States, PP has not been major contributor to growing wage inequality in Britain. Concerns about the use of PP as a potentially major contributor to rising inequality thus appear ill-founded, and this is prompting policy analysts to consider other potential causes in more detail.

It is also worth noting that the preference for evidence-based policy making has provided opportunities for us to engage with policy advisers to discuss the limitations of the current data infrastructure when addressing the links between PP and some of the issues noted above. We have begun discussions with the Bank of England about the development of high-frequency linked employer-employee data covering firms' output and labour costs, and we have initiated round-table discussions between academics, the Office for National Statistics and the UK Data Service about the further development of the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) dataset for research use. We have also contributed to public debate about the utility of the Workplace Employment Relations Survey for research on pay issues. 

Turning to the use of our findings by the corporate sector this has taken two principal forms. First HR managers have been keen to establish how and why their competitors use various forms of PP to recruit, retain and motivate staff. We have been able to provide detail on these issues for nationally-representative populations of firms and workplaces with the array of large-scale data sets we have analysed. This has allowed HR managers to &amp;quot;benchmark&amp;quot; their operations against those of their competitors. Second, we have engaged in detailed analysis of one particular firm's compensation policies (ShareCo is the pseudonym we use) and, in particular, their use of a tax-advantaged all employee share plan. We have shown that members of the scheme outperform their non-member colleagues on a number of dimensions that are productivity-enhancing, a message the company is now disseminating via its industry networks.

Finally, our findings have been used in the media to further understand the extent to which the financial crisis was, at least in part, driven by the PP-based incentives driving key workers in the finance sector. We have been able to show how extensive the use of PP is in the finance sector, and how the sector's reliance on PP grew dramatically prior to the 2008 crisis. We have also shown how rapidly the sector returned to the use of very substantial gearings between PP and salaries since 2010. However, we are less adamant than some others that PP is &amp;quot;to blame&amp;quot; for the crisis since there is little in our work to suggest that PP has been used to the detriment of firm performance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>38C6E8F3-CE18-4988-B3B5-A7CF859FF53D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>560ba4a939a6b2.10437153</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have improved understanding of performance pay (PP) and its impact by achieving the four research objectives in our proposal, but also by examining other facets of PP such as its links to employee well-being. Our most significant achievements are:

1. Establishing the prevalence of PP across the economy and over time
a. PP is widespread. Approaching half (45%) of all jobs are PP jobs, and 30% of employees are in receipt of PP in a given year. PP extends into all sectors and all levels of the occupational hierarchy.
b. PP accounts for 6% of all wages in the economy, but in Finance PP accounts for 30% of all wages. 
c. The share of all wages paid as PP rose markedly between 2003-2008, fell dramatically in the recession, but has recovered somewhat since 2010. This reflects change in the size of PP payments for PP workers. The growth in PP jobs, seen in the 1980's and 1990's, has ceased. 
2. Identifying PP's impact on wages
a. Employees in PP jobs earn around 36% more than non-PP workers, but the PP wage premium is 15% among observationally-equivalent employees. One third of this premium is due to the greater propensity of high-paying workplaces to use PP. There are thus strong sorting mechanisms into PP jobs. 
b. The likelihood of PP increases as one moves up the wage distribution, as does the PP wage premium. Wages are thus more dispersed in the presence of PP than they would be in its absence. However, PP has contributed only modestly to growth in wage dispersion during the 2000's.
c. Changes in PP payments accounted for only 16 per cent of the decline in aggregate wages between 2009 and 2012. The wage restraint seen through recession is thus largely the result of adjustments to base pay (in both PP and fixed-wage jobs). 
d. Nevertheless, PP jobs were more likely to survive the recession than comparable fixed-wage jobs, consistent with employers making use of the wage flexibility inherent in PP jobs to retain employees in hard times.
3. Identifying links between PP and firm performance
PP is positively associated with firm profitability and productivity. PP is also more responsive to the business cycle and to firm performance than base pay. However, movements in PP over the past decade are not wholly explained by contemporaneous changes in firm performance, suggesting that firms have additional motivations beyond wage flexibility. One may be to engender greater effort through a 'gift-exchange', as we find that collective forms of PP are associated with increased job satisfaction. 
4. Influencing policy formation through: 
a. a NIESR seminar on PP attended by representatives from government, business and trade unions; 
b. presentations at employers' conferences in London and Shanghai; 
c. media coverage in the Financial Times and The Guardian; 
d. a themed issue of the National Institute Economic Review, distributed to a range of government and corporate subscribers
e. mentions of papers from this study in Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee members' speeches</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? Policy makers will build on the enhanced understanding of the nature and impact of PP, especially with respect to wage growth and wage inequality, and the use of bonuses in Finance and elsewhere. 
? Academics will benefit from our method for classifying PP jobs in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). We have developed links between the Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey (MWSS) and other ONS business data, providing new opportunities for PP-related research. 
? Our findings have reached academic audiences through seminar/conference presentations and discussion papers. One paper has been published in JRSS Series A, two are book chapters, two are under review at the British Journal of Industrial Relations and the International Journal of Manpower. Three other submissions are scheduled for the New Year following presentations at AEA and RES. 
? We have begun discussions with the Bank of England about the development of high-frequency linked employer-employee data, based on MWSS, and we have initiated round-table discussions between academics, the ONS and the UKDS about the further development of ASHE for research use. We have also contributed to public debate about the utility of the Workplace Employment Relations Survey for research on pay issues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>836A3DD9-4126-4C3F-8FDD-B90A7A887E1F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>547eee44a6a4b8.04049305</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmace</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://niesr.ac.uk/projects/prevalence-and-effects-performance-related-pay-britain-0</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in &amp;quot;Spare Capacity and Inflation&amp;quot;, Martin Weale, Member of Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England to CBI, Belfast, 18 June 2014</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E76E5D6-8AEC-4D10-A25B-E2FEBE2C72FF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545bc0c852ea14.70696027</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E4CA4FE-BBE5-45F6-8C62-CBF132C6C159</gtr:id><gtr:title>Share Capitalism and Worker Wellbeing</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ccafffe7ff946bfe4961baeb0c36092d"><gtr:id>ccafffe7ff946bfe4961baeb0c36092d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bryson A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5491c08521e853.77863083</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BC904F77-B475-4867-BA8C-D6528387B8FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Are Firms Paying More For Performance?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/146e2d8bb9dbc20c8a1494c3e5f042e1"><gtr:id>146e2d8bb9dbc20c8a1494c3e5f042e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Forth, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_3008318555cae0161a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2B1925DA-B15A-433A-AA04-BA5280E1BCDD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Public Sector Remuneration in Scotland</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5f8ac18d2073c5d98868bba362f87adc"><gtr:id>5f8ac18d2073c5d98868bba362f87adc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elliott, R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545bb44ce9cd80.83019295</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5501218C-DF24-4B72-9034-E187C365F882</gtr:id><gtr:title>Who fared better?
