How will technologies change the way children interact and learn? Can we create new forms of digital materials for learning? This grant will address such questions by examining how young children (aged 5-8 years) use materials, both digital and non-digital, to help them think and learn mathematics.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To understand the role of interaction, we will compare the way children explain number concepts (such as why 2+7=3+6) using materials such as wooden cubes, paper, or squares manipulated on an iPad, or gesture-recognition device (eg Wii). Using video, we will examine the relationship over time of what children say, how they move materials, where they look, and how they gesture.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will address long-standing theoretical questions about the relationship between the way we act and the way we think, and the role gesture plays. It will also produce much-needed research for teachers and policy makers about the importance of providing young children with hands-on learning experiences, and the impact of devices such as iPads. The research will also inform designers of how we can create novel learning materials using emerging forms of technology.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal has been developed in order to maximise academic, economic, social, and cultural impact.

Academic
As identified in the Academic Beneficiaries section, this proposal is able to draw links between disciplines and consequently foster creative collaborations. A key aspect of the project is the development of novel methods for analyzing multimodal forms of interaction and expression. These methods will be communicated with researchers across disciplines (as well as directly training the Research Assistant employed for video analysis).

Economic
Digital technologies are transforming business, government, wider society, and increasingly education through a number of start-up companies. For example, in the last two years, more than 1000 commercial applications for the iPad have been marketed for young children. By furthering our understanding of children's interaction with technology and learning, this project can help evaluate these and develop new learning designs, both physical and virtual. Indeed, I developed good links with UK industry during my ESRC fellowship (e.g. BBC, 2simple, VTech, Promethean, LandofMe) through events such as the Digital Childhood seminar series and STELLAR (European project for Technology Enhanced Learning) meetings. My recent support for the company PlingToys demonstrates the potential of this research to promote new start-ups. 

This proposal is also able to inform financial decisions about purchasing equipment in schools. Echoing previous trends (e.g. electronic boards), there has been a recent interest in Early Years Education for devices such as iPads. Considering how these devices continue to be updated, information is needed to evaluate what may constitute significant investment.

Social
The studies proposed in this research will involve several schools, notably those in areas where children may have less educational experiences with novel forms of technology. As the research focuses on a curriculum area (number concepts), this will directly benefit the children taking part in studies, as well as other children (in the class and school) where I will take advantage of my previous experiences as a teacher to explain the concepts focused upon, and encourage reflection on the role of technology. Providing information to teachers and parents will also develop their knowledge to support children. Findings from the research, as well as the training materials and digital resources provided, will develop the expertise of a much larger audience of early years professionals.

This research will contribute to our understanding of the role of technology in young children's education. Reflecting greater awareness of the importance of digital literacy in education, this has become an increasing focus of political and media debate. As well as provide much needed information to evaluate claims for the benefits or perils of young children's use of technology, this research can help foster debate surrounding the educational opportunities offered by devices that are increasing available to children before they start school. Such possibilities need to be considered alongside equality issues arising from differences in provision.

Cultural
The increasing integration of technology in society has had a large cultural impact, causing many to critically reflect upon the nature of such change. Digital technology influences how we interact with the world and each other; providing technologies for young children requires us to reconsider our values and responsibilities. This research touches upon many of these issues, such as when and how we introduce young children to digital devices, the importance of hands-on interaction in the way we think and learn, or how technology influences, and sometimes challenges, traditional adult-child interactions. A key aim will be to engage a wide audience from diverse backgrounds in these themes central to this research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>163235</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Animation summarising the project</gtr:description><gtr:id>82E96248-F5A1-4A3B-B9F9-B58A0F0E2382</gtr:id><gtr:impact>200 views - but also used in presentations of work to wider public audience</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e6e17a32c4.90320421</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>3 Ways Hand Gestures can Influence How We Learn</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/manches/gesturenumbers</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Move2Learn</gtr:description><gtr:id>3630094D-5815-4DD9-BCC9-AC3D25156362</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To return to as per advice</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d470a04ff0b6.09883846-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners are the PI and other collaborators on the Phase 1 Science Learning plus application.

The research has also supported the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom by creating a focus of research excellence in children and technology, a key part of a newly formed Digital Education group at the University of Edinburgh. Through this research, the group has worked with a number of industry partners, and directly led to the formation of a spin-out company, PlayTalkLearn, that has secured industry grant funding for technological realization of the research and attracted strong interest from international investment. The company shares values with the research - to improve early learning for all children.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1F950E61-03CC-4BFD-8543-BA9DEC4E3125</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb784682bb4.11032641</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Digicubes is an app developed for knowledge sharing for this grant.

The project generated significant new knowledge by interpreting the cognitive effect of concrete learning materials in terms of two conceptual metaphors that recent work suggests underpin all numerical concepts: numbers as collections of objects or numbers as point locations along a line. A significant implication is we can use these metaphors to investigate the use and impact of different materials like blocks or number lines through children's numerical development. Whilst this project applied this lens to examine the role of concrete materials for one concept (additive composition of number), significant new questions are raised concerning a range of other number concepts - from counting to more advanced mathematical concepts. 

A further theoretical contribution was to develop a framework that considers the extent to which children's gestures (simulated actions) are influenced by the presence of materials. Significantly, the way children move from action with blocks to gestures in front of blocks, and then gestures without blocks may be significant steps in how actions are internalized in numerical thinking.

Methods
In order to study the effect of using different materials on the metaphors children use to communicate their understanding of number, new research methods were developed for coding certain words (e.g. 'take', 'put', 'after', 'up') and gestures (e.g. pinching, bringing hands together, arcing action along an imaginary line) that children created in their numerical explanations. This coding enabled quantification and comparisons of children and adults' use of metaphors. This methodological tool provides a novel means address an enduring educational question: what is the effect of using concrete materials on children's number concepts.

Digital Resources
In order to examine the effect of actions on children's subsequent gestures, a digital resource was created that enabled children to move on-screen blocks using pronounced gestures. This research resource has been adapted to create an engaging knowledge exchange tool. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate how digital technology can change the properties of physical materials, an engaging app was developed as another powerful knowledge exchange tool. Finally, a spin out company was created that brought the ideas of the digital app with physical blocks: a powerful set of digital physical number blocks. The company received, and has successfully completed, a technology grant to build the blocks and intends to take the early learning product to children this year. 

Networks
The wider goal of the grant is to understand children's interaction with materials, and the implications for new forms of digital interaction. This grant provided the momentum to create the Children and Technology research group at the University of Edinburgh that is now a key research cluster in the recently formed Digital Education centre and developed significant further collaborations, not least with organisations focusing on children's computing education. The focus of the grant has created new collaborations, including two externally funded collaborative projects, one looking at the role of the body in the development of computing concepts, an another US collaboration exploring digital body interaction exhibits to support early science concepts in museums.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As planned in the pathways to impact, the research has been shared through a wide range of academic (e.g. international conferences, journal papers, further collaborative grants) and non-academic routes (Science festivals, website materials, teacher conferences). The grant has also enabled the holder to be awarded 5 year membership of the Young Academy of Scotland, thereby amplifying the opportunity for impact.
There are two most significant ways the outcomes will be taken forward: firstly in the form of guidance for teachers on the use of gesture and actions with materials in teaching. As well as through the teacher education in the school, this audience will be reached through training materials (e.g., Early Arts), an engaging research animation, and research information on the app developed for teachers.

The second most significant outcome with potential high impact is the formation of an early learning technology spin out company. This company received funding for developing a digital physical product based on the research and will license out the app. The company is dedicated to the development of early years STEM - with significant economic and social impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>91AA567F-E2DC-4DB8-B3E4-9E1547496B7B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddd77c581343.21199967</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.de.ed.ac.uk/project/interaction-embodiment-and-technologies-early-learning</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>App developed as Knowledge Exchange tool from grant (and co-funded by UoEdinburgh as an impact activity)
