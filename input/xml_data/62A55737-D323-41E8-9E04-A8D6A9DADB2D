He had taken movie reels from a local cinema and repeatedly inserted single frames containing simple messages: &amp;quot;Eat popcorn&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Drink Coca-Cola&amp;quot;. The frames were essentially invisible, rushing by too fast for anyone to see, but their effects were extreme: A huge increase in sales at the concession stand. Vicary's finding suggested a powerful role for the unconscious in our everyday lives, and a lucrative new method for advertisers. There was just one problem: He was never able to corroborate the data. His startling result was false.

In the intervening fifty years, we have learned a lot about the unconscious. Techniques for &amp;quot;masking&amp;quot; the world from consciousness have revealed the complex cognitive processes that proceed without awareness. But the role of awareness in language -- our primary means of understanding the world and making ourselves understood -- remains surprisingly unexplored, perhaps a legacy of Vicary's controversy. 

This project aims to correct that imbalance, investigating how understandable linguistic meanings arise from the combination of language and awareness. I want to understand the degree to which awareness of the world is a precondition for understanding and producing language. This topic is important in many different ways. It is important for science: Language and consciousness are two critical components of the human experience; understanding their interrelation can help us understand ourselves. It is important for society: Delineating the role of conscious awareness in understanding and being understood can help us to make sense of, and predict, people's behaviour. Finally, it is important for healthy development: As children grow, they have to develop the correct relationship between language and awareness. Understanding how this process might go wrong could improve the lives of both typically and atypically developing individuals.

My approach is broadly focused and experimental in nature. The project examines how language and awareness interact in healthy adults, typically developing children, and individuals with schizophrenia, a developmental disorder often associated with impaired awareness. I use sophisticated experimental techniques to mask sentences from awareness, and then test the degree to which adults can still extract some understanding. I use eye tracking to measure what things in the world children, patients and healthy adults are aware of, and then test whether differences in awareness can explain some of the difficulties that both children and patients have in crafting clear, understandable descriptions of the world.

The results should be important for all of the reasons set out above: They will inform both scientific theories, and methods for alleviating linguistic difficulties. And they will set the stage for future work where, in collaboration with others, I can complement our initial measurements of behaviour with an assessment of the twin neural underpinnings of language and consciousness.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?
Language and awareness are intimate parts of our daily lives. Our ability to communicate our conscious experiences, and to understand the experiences of others, is core to our understanding of what makes us human. A scientific exploration of the interrelations of these domains should therefore be of interest to a variety of stakeholders. Meanwhile, the research is likely to produce outcomes of tangible importance to educators, clinicians, and anyone interested in influencing choices and behaviours.

1) Influencing choices and behaviours.
In 1957, the advertising executive James Vicary claimed that subliminally presented sentences (&amp;quot;buy Coca-Cola&amp;quot;) influenced consumer purchases. That result did not stand up to scrutiny, but our pilot data suggests that unconscious messages might still be processed. Potentially, the fruits of that processing could influence future choices and behaviour, which would be of obvious interest to a variety of groups, from businesses wooing customers to public services. An understanding of this issue also fits the ESRC's strategic priority of understanding how to influence behavior.

2) Impact on educators and clinicians.
The ability to speak clearly and precisely is a key part of everyday life; linguistic skills are a core predictor of life outcomes. Our research can shed light on why some individuals have difficulty communicating clearly (whether in childhood or during mental illness), and so should be of interest to anyone who works with these individuals. Importantly, it also opens up a possible path to improving life outcomes, by training attention to bolster language. This should be of interest to speech-language pathologists, as well as clinicians working with psychiatric patients.

3) Impact on the broader community.
The proposed research touches on consciousness, language, and the process by which children learn to talk. These are all topics that fascinate the general public, inasmuch as they touch on fundamental questions about being human. For instance, a recent article in the Guardian newspaper listed an explanation for consciousness as one of &amp;quot;the 20 big questions for science&amp;quot;. Similarly, parents are entranced by the rapid progress -- and occasional errors -- that characterise their growing child's language. This level of interest provides an opportunity to educate the public about not only our own results, but also the methods and importance of social science research more generally. 

I will engage these stakeholders through both participation and dissemination. For example, individuals and families who participate in our research will gain experience of state-of-the-art science, discovering how scientists can measure cognitive processes even if they are unconscious, or embedded in the mind of a very young child. I will also act to disseminate research through lectures at schools and local museums, by describing findings on a website for the project, and by crafting press releases in association with both the ESRC and the University of Edinburgh press office. Full details are laid out in the Pathways to Impact section.

Evaluating impact
I will measure and evaluate impact through discussion of the results in the media, and interest in the results from stakeholders (measured by attendance at talks and lectures/visits to the project website). I will also solicit anonymous web-based feedback from attendees at etc, in order to judge the success of events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239925</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Berkeley</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Psychology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Mahesh Srinivasan on lexical flexibility</gtr:description><gtr:id>140071C7-17F6-44F3-A75D-EBE32BDD8FC9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rabagliati, H. &amp;amp; Srinivasan (in press).

We have been studying the roles of attention and awareness in how children learn to speak in informative ways. For example, we used eye tracking to assess where children look during &amp;quot;referential communication tasks&amp;quot;, where they have to describe an object surrounded by similar objects. We found no evidence that children monitored for the similarity between these objects, whereas adults showed the opposite pattern. This suggests that children's difficulty with informative communication is partially attentional.

2. We have been studying the role of attention in how adults understand multi-word utterances, like &amp;quot;big pink boat&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;big spotted boat&amp;quot;. We have shown that attention is necessary in order to understand phrases where words need to be specifically &amp;quot;bound&amp;quot; together, for instance, understanding that the word &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; might modify &amp;quot;spotted&amp;quot; or might modify &amp;quot;boat&amp;quot;, but not both at the same time. By contrast, attention is less important for understanding phrases where the modification structure is less important, like &amp;quot;big pink boat&amp;quot;. This has implications for designing instructions, as people are quicker and more accurate to understand certain types of instruction compared to others. For instance, this could be useful when designing communication systems for high time pressure situations.

3. We have been studying the role of conscious awareness in how adults understand multi-word utterances, following up on prior reports that certain types of sentences could be understood unconsciously. However, our experiments using this method have in fact determined that prior results were a statistical artefact, and instead suggest that there is no evidence that language can be understood without consciousness.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Output 1 could potentially have implications for understanding the language difficulties of, e.g., children with Social Communication Disorder.
