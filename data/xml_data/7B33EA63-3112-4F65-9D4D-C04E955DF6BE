Little is known regarding why these conditions occur with age; however they have been classified as functional bowel disorders. Signalling molecules such as serotonin regulate the motility of the bowel, and therefore investigating alterations in these signalling molecules may help our understanding of these disorders. In this proposed project we aim to develop a new medical device, known as the SensoPellet, which is a sensor based device moulded into the shape of a faecal pellet. This device will be used to understand the process of normal defecation. The device will consist of carbon composite electrodes encased in a cavity moulded into the shape of a faecal pellet. This device will be characterised for its suitability for conducting stable biological recordings in colonic tissue. Biological recordings will allow the means to simultaneously monitor serotonin levels and image the motion of the pellet to understand the process of terminal bowel motility. The ability of the device to help us elucidate the process of normal defecation is important to understand what changes occur during the onset of age related disorders or how colonic motility is altered by various therapeutic agents utilised at present.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project will demonstrate impact to the academic community, the health sector, industry and the general public. This proposal merges a variety of core disciplines, and the interdisciplinary nature of the study would be of interest to academics working in the fields of gastroenterology, sensor research, medical devices, bioengineering and pharmacology. The Sensopellet device will utilise sensors for recording key signalling molecules that regulate colonic motility. The processes involved in the fabrication and application of the device will also be of interest to the academic community. 
The number of clinical cases of chronic constipation and faecal incontinence will rise with the ageing population. Although these conditions are not terminal, they have a major impact on the patients' quality of life and often lead to social isolation. The development of the Sensopellet device will allow a means of linking the functional changes observed with recordings of signalling markers. The studies proposed in this project will provide key insights into the link between signalling and motility. BAP has previously demonstrated the impact of sensor based devices through publications in the field of gastroenterology, and the Sensopellet device can offer similar impact.
Medical devices are of great commercial interest, and the Sensopellet offers the ability to conduct measurements of key signalling molecules which other endoscopic pill devices fail to offer. These devices are focused on imaging the lining of the gut, but faecal incontinence and chronic constipation show no visual signs during investigation. The Sensopellet will be of interest to Capsule endoscopy manufacturers and also the pharmaceutical industry, as this device will facilitate studies of the efficacy of therapeutic agents to alter the motility of the bowel. 
Finally and most importantly this research will have an impact on the wider public. I am planning to disseminate the data obtained from the research in the public domain through presentations at local schools and colleges. We aim to showcase the application of new technological devices as new potential diagnostic tools to study biological processes and understand the process of ageing. I will also present the benefits of multidisciplinary science in tackling a challenging research problem.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98989</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference Presentation - Pittcon</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84D713BC-4FED-484F-8617-202E26AF0D3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of an oral abstract and symposium presentation at the leading analytical chemistry conference.

During this study we were able to fully manufacture the components of the device using novel carbon based materials to act as the sensor. We housed the sensor into a polymer based cavity that was shaped as an artificial faecal pellet thus would be suitable for biological assays. Various successful prototypes were developed and characterised. The device showed fit for purpose sensitivity, stability and reproducibility for biological measurements. Simultaneous recordings of faecal pellet motility and monitoring of signalling molecules were carried out to study if the device could function in the isolated colon. The device was able to show important functional knowledge about the relationship between motility and signalling and thus will provide key insight into how the bowel functions and how it may be targeted for drug treatment in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research will highlight key important insight into how colonic motility and signalling are linked and thus would be important to the healthcare service and the pharmaceutical industry. We also will use this device to enhance pharmacological teaching of colonic motility and thus could provide a niche in new teaching approaches. This research will lead to various peer reviewed publications that showcase the novel engineering of the materials used to make the device and also the final device itself. The final product is also subject to patent.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>48DFFD2D-DAAC-4F2C-B1C8-328E4ACDF266</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-336371371.83581617771680a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and
