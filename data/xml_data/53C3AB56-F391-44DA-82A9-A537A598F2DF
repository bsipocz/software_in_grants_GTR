(David Lowenthal, 1996) 
 
Climate change is the greatest challenge of our times, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and combating its impacts is one of the key UN Sustainable Development Goals. One symptom of our rapidly warming world is accelerated sea level rise. With 150 million people across the world living within 3 feet of today's water levels, the consequences will affect each of us directly or indirectly. Former president of Kiribati, Anote Tong, describes the relationship between sustainable development and climate change as 'inseparable'. For Small Island Developing States, addressing development challenges while planning for climate change is a constant struggle. Kiribati is a low-lying island nation in the Pacific Ocean, and is often defined by the grim prognosis for its future. Yet there are pressing development challenges which affect people's lives in Kiribati today, such as access to clean water, and dealing with increasing amounts of waste. As Claire Anterea from the environmental organisation Kirican has said 'we will drown in rubbish before we drown in water'. This project team will work with Kirican, in Kiribati, to co-design a community-level programme towards sustainable development. This grassroots approach will inform the broader development field about the specific challenges facing Kiribati, and Small Islands Developing States more generally.

If heritage in its most fundamental sense is about what we value collectively, and want to preserve for the future, then it is entirely logical that academics and practitioners in the heritage field should care about the environment and sustainable development. According to a recent UNESCO report, climate change poses the greatest risk to world heritage, yet heritage concerns are not as prominent as they should be in this field. One of Kiribati's adaptation strategies is to plan for 'migration with dignity' for its population of over 110,000. We will consult with heritage organisations in Kiribati to find out how and whether they are planning for climate change and even potential displacement. This responds to more general concerns amongst global preservation professionals, such as archivists, about their own role within climate adaptation. Should the relocation of cultural resources and archives of climate-vulnerable nations be planned? How could such an enterprise could be managed practically and ethically, and by whom? The research team will also collaborate with the artist and cultural expert Natan Itonga to make a film evoking the rich cultures of Kiribati. This is part of a creative process that aims to understand the local meaning of heritage in Kiribati, and promote awareness of what is at stake. Overall, this project explores both the scope and limitations of attempts to 'preserve' heritage in face of rapid environmental change or when the natural environment itself is heritage at risk. What can be 'saved' at all when the impacts of climate change are so catastrophic for nations like Kiribati, and is it still meaningful to talk about sustainable development?

This project works through ideas of loss but focuses on connections; specifically, finding enduring connections to potentially lost objects to carry us into the future, caring for our current connections to land, water and non-human life, and accepting moral connections between the most polluting- and vulnerable- countries. As Anote Tong said to participants at the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit in 2013: 'Are we here to secure the future of each other's children or just our own?' Within this project, heritage is positioned as a pivotally important field of expertise for understanding that global challenges of magnitude will nonetheless be felt locally, everywhere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit Kirican, a local grassroots environmental organisation in Kiribati, resourced by this project to consult with a local community in South Tarawa, then to implement and evaluate a sustainable development project based on the community's needs and priorities. This will help Kirican to fulfill their general mission to promote social justice through awareness of climate change and sustainable development. Kirican also plan to offer a training placement to a young person to help them deliver the project, which will offer that person a valuable educational opportunity. The process of delivering this project may enhance Kirican's networks and influence, offer new insights or understanding and build their organisational capacity. By working specifically through two women at Kirican, there is scope for improving gender equality in Kiribati, which is in itself a sustainable development goal.

The community engaged by Kirican will also benefit from this process, as they will have the opportunity to express their own needs, and potentially to have those needs addressed. It is likely that such development priorities will relate to a cleaner environment, better waste management, access to safe water or sanitation. Priorities could be addressed in a number of ways, including through environmental education that enables the community to work together to solve some of its own problems. Alternatively, this process may reveal a need for a specific policy or policy change, which could inform local or national government, for longer-term benefit, or the community may identify an immediate tangible need for an item such as a rain-harvesting system. 

The broader development field could learn from this exploratory research in a number of ways. The UN Sustainable Development Goals were created through intergovernmental discussions, and were not intended to be country-specific. Applying them to a particular local context is a good way to see whether there are weak links in the way that these goals have been conceived, and also to evaluate how climate change acts as a factor to hinder the successful implementation of sustainable development goals in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). A more nuanced understanding of the particular challenges faced by SIDS could inform policy makers in the region, and beyond. Similarly, the use of a grassroots, gender-aware approach may yield new insights. We would promote these findings to this field through Kirican's extensive networks, the project's independent adviser on development, Alyson Brody, and through our project partners the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the National Trust's international networks. We will also offer edited online videos as a freely-available resource to targeted organisations of relevance 

This project's efforts to acknowledge and promote the importance of heritage may benefit organisations charged with its promotion and protection in Kiribati. Often portrayed as a generic 'drowning paradise' in media representations, the global community is largely unaware of the richness and diversity of the heritage of Kiribati, at risk because of climate change. A collaborative film produced with local artist Natan Itonga, promoted to an international audience, may nurture greater cross-cultural understanding and a reminder of the urgent need for a reduction in carbon emissions. The arts have a role to play in creating powerful stories to compel such action. More complex representations could also benefit communities in Kiribati, by informing culturally appropriate strategies for addressing global challenges such as sustainable development, climate change, and even future potential displacement, at a national and international level. The focus on the management and potential relocation of cultural resources, artifacts and archives in the event of displacement may also inform the practice and capacity of heritage organisations in Kiribati.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79960</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007635/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
