The 'financialisation' of Chinese housing, land and infrastructure - the use of financial instruments to convert the built environment into investment opportunities - generates momentum and vitality in the Chinese economy and has led to wealth accumulation. Real estate financing instruments such as the real estate investment trust (REITS), mortgage securitisation, reverse mortgages and public-private partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure have been recently invented. On the other hand, traditional real estate financial products such as household mortgages and real estate loans benefit from new internet-based finance. Chinese real estate finance has now entered a phase of 'financial explosion'. 

However, the concrete channels, complex arrangements and new instruments are not entirely known. This research project aims to investigate how housing, land and infrastructure are actually financed, what are the new financial instruments, to what extent there is a trend of 'financialisation', and what are the risks associated with this transformation. We examine the recent trend of financialisation in terms of the forms and extent of the involvement of both the formal and the unofficial ('shadow banking') sectors in real estate development. Recent developments in REITS and PPP will be examined to show the inflow of financial capital in housing, land, and infrastructure projects. We explore how the Chinese housing boom has been financed in the absence of a more developed financial system, and to what extent the financial sector has contributed to the overall appreciation of housing and land assets. We will also try to understand the potential impacts of financialisation on households, enterprises and local government finances (i.e. the issue of 'local debt') and what are the main factors affecting financial stability. 

The project investigates three levels of financing mechanisms: projects and enterprises, local governments, and individual households. We choose six case cities: in the coastal region, Shanghai and Shenzhen; the central region: Zhengzhou and Changsha; the western region: Chongqing and Chengdu. At the project level, we will conduct in-depth interviews with developers, real estate agents and local government officials so as to understand the complex financial arrangements of these projects. At the local government (city) level, we will examine the institutional environment and policies regarding built environment finance, including the involvement of housing provident funds. At the household level, the project will conduct a survey of 3,000 homeowners in these cities to understand household access to the financial sector. 

This research project will assess the recent trend of financialisation in Chinese housing, land and infrastructure sectors and provide a nuanced understanding of the changing financial mode, its dynamics and the new institutional environment. The project will examine emerging financial products and new channels in these sectors and their operational mechanisms. The project will focus on household financial behaviour to understand the new trend of financialisation of real estate and its impact on housing consumption, investment behaviour, and job preference. The project will further assess macroeconomic implications such as the impact on the Chinese financial system, financial product innovation, fiscal policies and company investment. Finally, these findings will lead to an assessment of the potential risks associated with financialisation and recommendations for risk management.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries: 

1. Chinese policy-makers in supervising the financial system and its reform (Ministry of Finance), housing development (Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Development, MoHURD), land management (Ministry of Land and Resources), resource allocation and five-year economic planning (National Development and Reform Commission). Knowledge of REITs and PPP in China is much needed for managing risk and proposing a feasible capital source for infrastructure development. 

2. Local governments in China who are confronted with debt and the need for sustainable sources of funding housing, land and infrastructure development, in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, and Chengdu. These cities have either experienced fast house price inflation (Shanghai, Shenzhen) or have experimented with a new method of financing (Chongqing, Chengdu). The research will reveal the dynamics of price inflation and advise sustainable development approaches to these governments.

3. Chinese urban residents, who suffer a heavy burden of housing affordability. On the other hand, there are some households aggressively engaged in investment in the housing market through investment instruments and leverage. These financing behaviours could be risky to their own wealth accumulation if price fluctuation occurs. The project will reveal the true picture of aggressive housing finance behaviour and associated risks. 

4. Companies investing in Chinese land and infrastructure projects. They may benefit from comparing different financial methods and associated risks with these approaches. 

5. UK government such as the UK department for International Development (DfID), the UK department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), and professional bodies such as the Royal Institute for Charted Surveyors (RICS) and the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI). 

They will benefit through:

a. Improving evidence for decision and policy-making: our household survey evidence on access to the finance sector may expose a more accurate picture of financial leverage and debt at the local government and household levels. It will provide much needed information for recent policy efforts to transfer the leverage of the real estate market and local debt to households. The insights gained from the detailed analysis of household characteristics and their housing consumption and finance will benefit the real estate sector in advising on systematic risks and risk management. Our in-depth interviews with stakeholders in land and infrastructure development and developers will provide new information on emerging practices to financial oversight agencies and local governments. 

b. Enhancing understanding by practitioners and policy makers of new financial instruments and their various practices in different cities. Our research bridges the knowledge gap between the built environment (housing, land and infrastructure) and the virtual environment (finance and capital flows). 

c. Supporting the business understanding in the UK economic sector of the Chinese market and the potential risk associated with the underdeveloped financial market. In particular, the development of PPP may provide important potential for collaboration between Chinese and UK business sectors and the transfer of UK knowledge in finance and financial management to China. The research may justify the need and identify precise areas for financial risk management. 

d. Enhancing public awareness of the use of financial instruments and their potential negative implications. This is vital in particular for middle-income groups who are increasingly attracted by new financial approaches for their housing consumption. While facing an affordability crisis, this group has also benefited from asset appreciation in the past and is thus beginning to change their perception of housing from accommodation to asset investment. But the risk has not been fully understood.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>329374</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>33119A29-C5F1-4D50-840C-E4BB6AB9B3A7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Housing privatization and the return of the state: changing governance in China</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Urban Geography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1d78563168f7d24f89cb327fe1ba977f"><gtr:id>1d78563168f7d24f89cb327fe1ba977f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wu F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a995cba5da148.74628910</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>73F3035C-B2A8-48CE-9A95-3EC0AA76DB35</gtr:id><gtr:title>Negotiating Green Space with Landed Interests: The Urban Political Ecology of Greenway in the Pearl River Delta, China</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Antipode</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bbedd6ecce1d003c6a47ee1d26da4f45"><gtr:id>bbedd6ecce1d003c6a47ee1d26da4f45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chung C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a93d3c21038d5.73143326</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P003435/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
