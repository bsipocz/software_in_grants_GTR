We are developing and testing a questionnaire to measure how badly foot or ankle problems affects children?s lives. Treatment aims to help children participate to the best of their ability and includes physiotherapy, orthotics (splints or braces) or surgery. However it is not easy to measure how good these treatment programmes are; consequently there is much uncertainty whether some treatments really work or which are best. Typically outcomes are measured by professionals assessing children?s abilities in the hospital. We now know that these tests may not reflect what children actually do when they are at home, school or outside in the community. We want to measure the outcome by asking the children themselves and their families. To achieve this we will first construct a questionnaire from issues children tell us are important. We will conduct focus groups with children from five to fifteen years old who are affected by the issues. We will then conduct a survey with families of children with foot or ankle problems in order to test the validity and reliability of the instrument.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aim
To develop valid and reliable outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of health services provided for foot and ankle problems in children. The measures will include an economic component and a child or family-assessed instrument which will be compared with existing professionally-assessed outcomes.
Relevance
Children are affected with a variety of foot and ankle problems that can limit their activities and participation in life situations. Children may be born with localised deformities such as clubfoot or acquire impairments through injury. In addition, the most common types of serious childhood physical disability affect children?s legs, including cerebral palsy, spina bifida and muscular dystrophy. The range of treatments available to manage foot and ankle problems includes orthopaedic surgery, therapy and orthoses. There is scant evidence for the effectiveness of many of these treatments and their usefulness is only usually measured with professionally-assessed outcomes. This lack of evidence can potentially lead to harm to children and a waste of health service resources from using ineffective treatments. The cost of health services relative to their effectiveness is important to determine. Patient-assessed outcomes are increasingly used with adults but to a lesser extent with children. When measuring outcomes it is important to include children?s preferences however some children may not wish or be able to provide information themselves and a parent-proxy informant is necessary in those cases. 
Objectives
 To review available outcome measures suitable for evaluating physical management of children.
 To identify key issues from the children and families? perspective.
 To develop a child or family-assessed instrument for children with foot and ankle impairments.
 To develop an economic appraisal tool to monitor the costs of health services.
 To pilot the instruments with children alongside professionally assessed measures.
 To determinvalidity and reliability of the instruments.
Research Plan
The research will be collaborative primarily between the Departments of Public Health and Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Oxford and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre NHS Trust. There will be a combination of both qualitative and quantitative research in developing and testing the economic and child and family-assessed instruments. Observational work will include focus groups with children and their families to identify themes and items for the questionnaire. The proposed quantitative research includes field-testing the instruments to check their suitability for the task, including assessing validity and reliability and agreement between child and proxy assessment. The instruments generated will have wide utility in the evaluation and monitoring of health services for children with foot and ankle problems in clinical audit and research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>188206</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A patient reported outcome measure for children with foot or ankle problems, licinsed through ISIS Innovation Ltd</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>G106/1243</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>FCDBA2A6-A596-4701-8AD0-989A0C02B6C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>increased interest in patinet reported outcome measures</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>254A3A57C64</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:protection>Copyrighted (e.g. software)</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2009</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>Patient reported outcome measure for children with foot or ankle problems</gtr:description><gtr:id>3CF717A0-CFE3-4BD9-94DF-46AB5627DAC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Being adopted by interested clinicians and researchers in UK and worldwide, including translation into Swedish, marketed by ISIS Innovation at University of Oxford</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>F28C9EFB327</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Small-scale adoption</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Patient reported outcome measure</gtr:title><gtr:type>Diagnostic Tool - Non-Imaging</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2009</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A patient reported outcome measure for children with foot or ankle problems has been developed in 3 stages: qualitative focus groups with children to devise the items (completed and published); cross-sectional survey to define scales and assess reliability and validity (completed and published); a longitudinal study of the responsiveness of scale scores to change with time and treatment (in progress).</gtr:description><gtr:id>B432C864-F1CD-470D-BDE7-EB04FF994635</gtr:id><gtr:impact>being used as an outcome measure in various research projects, under license from ISIS Innovation.
