The project uses an existing global data set and interactive web-based interface, but expands the data content, web functionality and user base through a series of targeted activities. These include the addition of regional pages; additional pages in Spanish, French, Portuguese and Arabic; and a public impact event held at the headquarters of the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Canary Wharf.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is based on research that has been conducted over a number of years on human rights indicators by the PI - eg:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Todd Landman, Protecting Human Rights (2005)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Beetham, Carvalho, Landman and Weir Assessing the Quality of Democracy (2008)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Landman and Carvalho, Measuring Human Rights (2009)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>and on a complementary project by the Co-I, Andrew Fagan, The State of Human Rights Atlas (2010).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The Human Rights Atlas was funded by the ESRC (ES/J000728/1), which was part of the ?follow on? fund, and the data set has been used for teaching,research, and internaitonal engagement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Partners for the current project include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Mackman Group&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Thomson Reuters Foundation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences-Mexico&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Human Rights Centre at the University of Essex.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project engages in a series of applied interventions and awareness raising activities, including face to face meetings and knowledge exchange events in Mexico (with the Faculty of Social Sciences, FLACSO), the Thomson Reuters Foundation in London, international conferences, and press releases and electronic promotion through social media networks and email newsletter subscriptions.

The immediate beneficiaries of the project are scholars and practitioners working in the area of human rights, including academic researchers, PhD students, MA students, and researchers based at non-academic organisations. The project combines political, legal, social, and economic indicators in ways that allow for interrogation of the main data base and the generation of customised output. The Atlas is also of interest to non-governmental organisations, businesses, multinational corporations, and international financial institutions who are increasingly interested in human rights performance profiles of countries with whom they are actively engaged. To this end, the PI has over the last year been meeting with business and human rights professionals (e.g. a series of Mazar's events and meetings co-organised with Tomorrow's Company, and a Business and Human Rights workshop in St Gallen, Switzerland). A centralised provision of up to date information of this kind is a much needed resource for which there is growing demand. The Atlas can be used for research, education, policy making and other activities that have a bearing on the ways in which organisations based in the UK and abroad think and talk about human rights.

The extended Atlas includes regional pages to address the rapid sets of changes in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as those taking place in China and Burma. The FCO, DFID and the British Council have a keen interest The direct assistance provided to a network of Latin American researchers allows the Atlas team to take the resource to an active regional research network seeking to map human rights developments in a region that undergone dramatic political transformations over the last three decades. Engaging with Thomson Reuters through its AlertNet resource places the Atlas in the heart of the humanitarian on-line space with a recognised global media brand.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48571</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Rights Track is a human rights podcast resource, initially funded by the Nuffield Foundation (2015-2016) and then the ESRC Research Impact Accelerator Award (2016-2017).

All these aims have been achieved. The main achievements of the project have been (a) a stronger and more streamlined underpinning source code for the site; (b) better user interface that allows the use to zoom the maps, while also chossing items from the menu options; (c) a site that is now available in Spanish, Portuguese, French and Arabic; (d) strengthened relationships with partner organisations The Mackman Group, Thomson Reuters and FLACSO-Mexico, (e) a new base file of data that is available for 1980 to 2012; (f) new publications and presentations using the data set; (f) greater user engagement; and (g) educational engagement with a new PhD cohort at Essex and other students in the UK and internationally. These main aims have been accompanied by a major public event for the Atlas held at Thomson Reuters headquarters in Canary Wharf (8/11/2013), ongoing collaboration with FLACSO-Mexico, and the attraction of a major data supplier (the Cingranelli and Richards Human Rights Data Project ) to seek a new partnership with the Atlas team for future data collection and dissemination. The partnership with The Mackman Group remains strong as the Atlas now includes new features and more flexible code for future development, as well as an instructional video on how to use the atlas. FLASCO Mexico included Professor Landman in a human rights workshop, a book publication on measuring human rights in Latin America, and sharing of data from its own research on democracy and human rights in Latin America since 1990. 
At a more detailed level, the project has involved collating and combining disparate sources of data on basic country performance and organising the data set into a time-series cross-section file with codebook. In addition to the raw data that were collected, the project also needed to convert and transpose these data for further visualisation. As the map have limited colour scales with which to depict the various different indicators, continuous measures such as population size, gross domestic product, land area and other measures needed to be converted into scales that are compatible with the map interface. This process of conversion used a 'visual binning' technique to subdivide the variable across its natural distribution (normal, positively skewed, or negatively skewed) in to meaningful catageories for plotting on the map.

There continues to be high demand for human rights indicators and human rights analysis from the international policy communities, the domestic and international non-governmental sector, and the national and international private sector. Landman delivered workshop sessions in 2013 and 2014 in Brussels for the European External Action Service (EEAS) and International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. In all these instances and in the future, the provison of easy to understand and well presented data on human rights alongside specialised analsysis and training continues to be of use to policy makers seeking to include human rights in their programme development. For example, BBC Media Action has been working on media participation and good governance, where they are trying to combine their own data with other existing data set such as the data in this project. Ongoing discussion are in process to engage BBC Media Action with Essex academics in ways that fulfil their mission and assist in their DFID-funded work. The are also plans to continue to engage with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy after five years of successful collaboration in areas of parliamentary strengthening, good governance and human rights; all of which will benefit from the Atlas project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>With the additional languages in the resource we can reach new audiences with an interest in the measurement, assessment and analysis of human rights conditions.
