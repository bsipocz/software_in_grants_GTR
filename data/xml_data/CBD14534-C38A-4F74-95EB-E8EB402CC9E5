Approximately half a million new cases are reported each year and the majority of them are not treated. Inadequately treated patients remain a source of infection to others in their community, Even if treated, outcomes are often poor with only about 65% of patients having a favourable outcome. 

Current recommendations for treatment by the World Health Organisation (WHO) are based on expert opinion rather than high quality evidence from well conducted randomised trials. WHO recommends that treatment should be given for a minimum of 20 months and at least 18 months following culture conversion. 

A series of cohort studies conducted in Bangladesh investigated alternative regimens based on different combinations of drugs and for shorter time periods than those recommended by WHO. The results of an intensive regimen given for only nine months were very promising The STREAM trial is designed to assess the effectiveness of a very similar regimen in a number of different countries compared to WHO recommended treatment. The favourable outcome rate of the nine month regimen from the study in Bangladesh was 88%, which is higher than the best estimates with standard treatment. However, since the nine month regimen is substantially shorter than the standard regimen the trial will be considered successful if the experimental regimen is shown to be at least as effective as the standard regimen.

The trial will be conducted in four countries in Africa and Asia in patients with confirmed MDR-TB who are sensitive on a rapid test to two of the key drugs in the experimental regimen. Patients with HIV will be eligible for the trial and will be encouraged to also take anti-retroviral treatment for their HIV according to local guidelines. All patients will be asked to return for follow-up visits monthly during and after treatment for a total of 27 months.

If this treatment proves to be successful, the trial results will have immediate and substantive implications for the treatment of MDR-TB world-wide and could be expected to lead to changes to the WHO recommendations. A shorter regimen is likely to improve overall adherence with a greater proportion of patients completing treatment leading in turn to a reduction in the rates of acquired drug resistance.

The potential reduction in costs to the patient and the health system will be evaluated as part of the STREAM study. A nine month treatment regimen would considerably reduce the burden of treatment to the patient. Patients would have fewer visits to healthcare facilities to receive treatment; there would also be benefits in terms of reduced travel costs and loss of earning. The costs to the health system are also likely to be reduced resulting in increased resources available to treat more patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The study is a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial designed to assess a regimen for MDR-TB based on the treatment given in Bangladesh described by Van Deun, 2010. The experimental regimen consists of moxifloxacin, clofazimine, ethambutol and pyrazinamide given for 9 months supplemented by kanamycin, isoniazid and prothionamide in the four months of the intensive phase; the continuation phase lasts 5 months. Standard doses are given for all drugs except for isoniazid and moxifloxacin which are given in higher doses. All drugs are given daily (seven days a week) except for kanamycin which is given daily for 3 months and then thrice-weekly subsequently. The intensive phase and total duration may be extended by up to two months if sputum smears are slow to convert. Patients on the control regimen will receive the locally-used WHO-approved MDR-TB regimen, given for a minimum of 18 months after culture conversion; this commonly takes 4-6 months and so most standard regimens last approximately two years. 

Patients will be randomised to either the experimental regimen or the locally-used WHO-approved MDR-TB regimen in the ratio 2:1 and be followed up to 27 months post-randomisation. 

The primary efficacy outcome is status at the end of follow-up i.e. the proportion of patients with a favourable bacteriological outcome 27 months after randomisation, provided they have not already been classified as unfavourable. Change of more than one drug for adverse reactions or any other reason is considered an unfavourable outcome. The primary safety outcome is the proportion of patients experiencing a grade 3 or greater adverse event during treatment and follow-up.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine 2010; 182 684-92</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Currently there are almost half a million new cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) each year of which a negligible proportion are being diagnosed and even less are treated. Among those that are treated the results are poor, a recent meta-analysis of studies reported a median favourable outcome of only 65%. There has never been a phase III trial to evaluate treatment regimens for MDR-TB and WHO recommendations are currently based almost entirely on expert opinion with a low level of supporting evidence. 

The results achieved in the cohort study conducted by Van Deun and colleagues in Bangladesh were impressive both in respect of the high level of relapse free cure obtained, 88% two years after starting treatment, and the short duration of the regimen, 9 months compared to durations in excess of 18 months currently recommended by WHO for this patient group. 

If the STREAM study is successful in reproducing outcomes similar to those obtained in Bangladesh there will be immediate implications for the treatment of MDR-TB world-wide. The WHO Guidelines Department Trials of new drugs for MDR-TB are in the planning stage but none will be starting before 2012 at the earliest. 

The impact at field level could be considerable; a short, relatively inexpensive but highly effective treatment would be very attractive to National TB Programmes who would be able to treat more patients thereby also reducing the pool of infectious MDR-TB patients in the community thus impacting not only on the prevalence but incidence of new cases.

The Director of the STOP-TB Department of WHO has welcomed the STREAM study as being an important initiative to address the serious public health problem posed by MDR-TB.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1187329</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp (ITM)</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BF5E89B-0F95-46AE-B173-F3733889FBA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No public outputs yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6da87723cf1.13162436-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>ITM are providing laboratory based expertise essential to the conduct of the STREAM MDR-TB trial, assessing site laboratories, conducting training on site and performing drug sensitivity testing.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provide positive isolates from sites participating in the STREAM MDR-TB trial enabling routine and experimental work to be done by ITM on the samples.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Voice of America Interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B9C3DC7-33F0-4CDD-B27A-BF807477440D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No feedback
