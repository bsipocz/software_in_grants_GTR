There is a clear link between PrP genotype and differences in susceptibility/resistances to experimental scrapie and BSE and natural TSEs in sheep, however the controlling mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level are not understood. This research programme will use various approaches to address these issues including detailed analysis of PrPc expression patterns in different genotypes of sheep, demonstrating age-related susceptibility differences and how these may be related to gut physiology changes, and establishing which cells are involved in maternal transmission of scrapie in utero, and/or during the first 24 hours of a lamb&amp;iquest;s life. The NPU Cheviot flock has endemic natural scrapie and has recently been found also to have atypical scrapie, which gives us a unique chance to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis and transmission of both diseases in comparison with experimental strains. The NPU flock has detailed records going back to its creation in the 1960s and has produced a unique archive of tissue samples available for PrP protein and genotype studies with newer technologies as they become available. The flock also represents an opportunity to assess diagnostics and to test therapies such as pentosan polysulphate. Finally this project will include strain transmission studies and titrations in conventional and transgenic mice expressing sheep gene PrP alleles to allow us to demonstrate whether genotype and PrPc levels are associated with infectivity titre changes. PrPsc glycoform and IHC analyses are carried out on all animals and transmissions, to identify the infecting TSE strain and provide body tissue patterns of PrPsc expression which allow us to describe pathogenesis in detail.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>350772</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Nil return.
