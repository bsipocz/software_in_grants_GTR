Funding is sought to allow a poet, a sound artist and a visual artist to work alongside scientists to engage school children to develop their understanding of arts and science in seven partner schools. The engagement activities will culminate in a series of public performances and exhibitions of visual and performance art work from the artists and school children on the theme 'Imagining the Sun'. 

The Think Solar Physics initiative will utilise Northumbria expertise from the Think Physics initiative, with the exciting outreach opportunities provided by the STFC funding of DKIST. Think Solar Physics aims to: 
i) SHOWCASE UK solar physics research to young people and their key influencers; 
ii) BUILD science capital in the North East through the linking of science and art, leading to a greater understanding of aspects of physics by young people, particularly girls; 
iii) ENCOURAGE uptake of physics-related subjects at A-level and higher levels; 
iv) SUPPORT teachers to use solar physics as a context for careers and curriculum teaching; 
v) EDUCATE young people and the general public about DKIST, providing ongoing publicity and outreach for STFC as breakthrough solar science research is conducted. 

This project will have a strong legacy. The poetry produced by the students will remain within their school in the form of attractive posters, and will be available to view on thinkphysics.org. Likewise, the artwork produced by the children will remain within their school and displayed during the academic year the work was created. A recording of the live piece with electronic soundtrack will be available on the Think Physics YouTube channel and also incorporated into Porteous' poetry performance repertoire and continue to be performed for a non-science general audience (estimated around 100 in 2017). The text will be considered for publication as part of Porteous' next poetry collection (within 2-3 year with a print run of approximately 1000). The artwork produced by Schell will be incorporated into her portfolio for exhibition. 
In addition to the physical legacy, the project will also develop the confidence of the researchers in taking part in public engagement and will provide a model for collaborative art-science outreach linked to DKIST.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main products of the Think Solar Physics (poetry performances and art work) will be publicised through the existing networks of the organisations involved.
Information about the project will be shared through posters and presentations at public engagement conference presentations such as BIG and Engage. The school collaboration will be disseminated through the ASE conference and publications. Researchers who have been involved with Think Solar Physics will be encouraged to include information about the work in presentations given at conferences, and through their interaction with researchers in other institutions.
 
The Northumbria University STFC research grant (ST/L006243/1) is part of a larger consortium led by Professor Mathioudakis at Queen's University of Belfast (ST/L0036308/1). This UK consortium consists of 7 universities and the Armagh Observatory. The evaluation of Think Solar Physics will identify good practice (and potential pitfalls) of art-science collaborations and these will be shared with the consortium members. This will also support the development of a larger public engagement and outreach project linked to first light of DKIST and beyond (2017 -2019).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imagining the Sun Visual Workshop Excelsior Academy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A495BC38-A6EF-4F01-B53B-4489D6123720</gtr:id><gtr:impact>15 students (year 8) took part in two workshops separated by a period of approximately two weeks. In the first workshop the students heard from Solar Physicists (Richard Morton and Krishna Moorogen) who talked about the structure of the Sun, and how he uses different wavelengths of light to investigate the nature of the Sun. Students also took part in demonstrations using different wavelengths led by NUSTEM staff. This was follwed by a hands-on art activity led by the visual artist (Helen Schell). Pupils were encouraged to use art to respond to the science that they had heard. At the end of this first workshop, students continued to work on the art pieces during school time. Helen and Krishna then returned to the school to find out what students had been doing, and to spend time continuing and completing the art pieces.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589df01a997360.61728660</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thinkphysics.org/imagining-the-sun/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Words by the Water</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15EED273-C46D-4FE5-8F45-09751EEBEF5B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a presentation at the Words by the Water Festival outlining Imagining the Sun, at Theatre by the Lake, which combined science, poetry and visual art.

Carol Davenport, Richard Morton, Helen Schell and Katrina Porteous presented their experience of taking part in the Imagining the Sun project.
The presentation also included extracts from a stereo mix of Sun, a poetry-and-music collaboration by Katrina Porteous and Peter Zinovieff, with photographic images realised by Chris Hudson and Jonathan Sanderson. This was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A session with the audience, both in the lecture theatre and in the exhibition of words and pictures in the Friends gallery at Theatre by the Lake.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58be77d8dd8e72.68195311</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/2017/03/northumbria-project-brings-solar-science-to-the-lakeside/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ItS SUN performance</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E32F974-61CD-4E32-8974-11158481F171</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sun, by Katrina Porteous and Dr Peter Zinovieff, is an immersive 25-minute performance of live poetry and surround-sound electronic music, accompanied by planetarium visuals and is an artistic response to the work of Northumbria University Solar Physics Research Group..
Peter's music, written in four electronic movements, is entirely derived from solar oscillation data from the SOHO Michelson Doppler Imager and each movement represents a 5 minute solar cycle.
Working together, the poetry, music and images explore the physical processes of the Sun, revealed in wavelengths beyond human perception, and the ways in which sound is used to 'look' inside it. Little by little, the music, words and visuals strip the layers of our nearest star, allowing us to travel where the body cannot, to experience a reality not otherwise accessible to sight or hearing.
SUN was presented in collaboration with Chris Hudson and Elin Roberts at Life Science Centre in Newcastle as part of their Lates programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac38664e8379.04643921</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/want-look-sun-heres-how-12175145</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Big Bang Fair NE, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>396857D1-E4E4-498D-A88A-75EF96DC6F2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Helen Schell, the visual artist who is working on Imagining the Sun, ran a stall at the Big Bang Fair NE to showcase both SOLAR (the large artwork she created inspired by working with the Solar Physicists), and to talk to primary and secondary students about the nature of the Sun.

Katrina then returned to the school to work with the students to look more deeply at how to respond to science with poetry students continued to work on their poems during school time. Katrina then returned to the school to find out what students had been doing, and to provide small group tutorials on the students work. 
After the poems were completed, a selection of poems were printed as posters and sent to the school for display in the Science and English departments.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac3540aa16a2.63950782</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thinkphysics.org/imagining-the-sun/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ItS Visual Workshop Oakfield Junior School</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>259EC795-FC6F-4CC7-B427-BDC4354A9269</gtr:id><gtr:impact>29 students (year 5) took part in two workshops separated by a period of approximately two weeks.
