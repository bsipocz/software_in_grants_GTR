However, while widely known and admired, his work as a typeface designer has never received the same attention - the only book on the subject is Robert Harling's 'The letter forms and type designs of Eric Gill' (1976) which is just 64 pages long.\n\nGill designed ten typefaces, all in the period 1926-34. By far the best known is Gill Sans, originally manufactured by the Monotype Corporation in 1928 - every computer now comes with a digital version. Gill Sans was the British answer to the geometrically constructed sans serif typefaces that were becoming popular on mainland Europe at the time. It has become arguably the most British of typefaces, used by British Railways, Penguin Books, the BBC, the Church of England, and the British government. His other well known typeface designs are Perpetua and Joanna, but the remainder - Perpetua Greek, Golden Cockerel Type, Solus, Aries, Floriated Capitals, Bunyan and Jubilee - are unknown to most designers and five have never been produced as digital typefaces.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century the design of typefaces was a two-stage process: the designer would make drawings and then a team of engineers would implement the design, often making changes to the design in order to make it work technically. In some cases this led to a dialogue between designer and engineer but often, having done the initial drawings, the designer left it to the engineers to make the necessary adjustments, to make decisions about letter spacing, and in some cases even to design the accompanying light and bold variants of the typeface.\n\nThis project will investigate the conception and production of each of Gill's typefaces and his relationships with the men and women who commissioned and implemented his designs and will discuss his work as a type designer in relation to his contemporaries in the field. In doing so it will re-evaluate Gill's contribution to typeface design. Can he really be described as a typeface designer, or were the typefaces that are attributed to Gill actually designed by the craftsmen and engineers who made them? As an artist, did Gill actually involve himself in the more mundane aspects of manufacturing hot metal type or did he remain aloof from the industrial part of the process? Did the production of Gill's typefaces for hot metal composition differ from those of other artists and designers of the period, or from the typefaces produced in-house by companies such as Monotype and Linotype?\n\nThe project will also analyze the extent to which the physical process of hot-metal typeface manufacture affected the appearance and functionality of Gill's typefaces. Were his ideas compromised because of limitations imposed by the technology, and is the original method of manufacture still in evidence in later versions of his typefaces, produced for photocomposition and digital typesetting? And what can today's typeface designers learn from this?\n\nThe research will draw extensively on the Eric Gill archives held by St Bride Library and the British Monotype Corporation Type Drawing Office. This will be facilitated at St Bride Library by the Librarian, Mr Nigel Roche, who has worked at St Bride for thirty-three years and at Monotype by the Type Development Manager, Mr Robin Nicholas, who has forty years' involvement in typeface development in a range of capacities. It will also make use of other Gill archives including those at Ditchling Museum, Sussex, Tate Britain, and the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will be:\n\n(a) the professional typeface design community\nSuperficially digital type technology is very different to that of hot metal but in fact many of the challenges faced by type designers remain the same, meaning that there are always useful lessons to be learned from the history of the craft. Understanding twentieth-century working methods in typeface design, and the relationships between design and production, will allow the work of Gill and his peers to be re-evaluated, making it more relevant for today's practitioners. The professional typeface design community will benefit from presentations at the Association Typographique International's annual conferences. \n\n(b) graphic designers, design students and the general public interested in design\nThe interest in typefaces among designers, design students and the general public has been evidenced by the success of the full-length documentary film Helvetica. The Non-Latin Typefaces exhibition and conference jointly held at Reading and St Bride was of interest to a smaller but highly committed audience. The general public are increasingly aware of, and sensitive to, typefaces and typography. Gill Sans, like Helvetica, is a typeface many people will be aware of and may have used themselves. The research will be disseminated to graphic designers, design students, and the general public through articles published in design publications such as 'Eye' and 'Baseline'.\n\nBoth groups will also have the opportunity to engage with events at St Bride Library (to include a free public lecture, an exhibition, and a conference on 20th century type design). The broader scope of the conference will mean that in addition to disseminating the work of Eric Gill the project will also promote a wider public discussion of typeface design in the twentieth century.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I02402X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
