While scientific capacity building is often cast as a common good, its practices and implementation at the level of local institutions are little understood, and yet it broaches concerns about the globalisation of science and health governance, the spatialisation of development practices, and the relationship between liberal democracy and scientific knowledge. These concerns are contrasted against urgent calls to secure the health needs of poorer populations, and through international research networks, advance knowledge and understanding of major health issues affecting world populations, such as how to mitigate the health effects of environmental change, how to cope with growing populations, and how to contain infectious diseases. 

The research focusses on the practices and perspectives of parliamentarians, parliamentary staff and researchers, donor agencies and research organisations in incorporating biomedical and health-related knowledge into parliamentary business. Drawing on text-based analysis of documents, in-depth semi-structured interviews and observational fieldwork of committee meetings, the study builds up a case study of science and health governance in the global south. The project examines the processes that bring scientific capacity into being, asking how 'capacity' is imagined by the different actors involved. By this means, it explores how knowledge production is translated into political communication and action, and how trajectories of health, biomedicine and democratisation converge in a legislative arena.

Political institutions are increasingly required to deliberate on issues that carry significant technical and scientific content. Parliaments emerge as important institutions that reassert the role of the state in development policy and carry the torch of democracy. Parliaments have the potential to bring together different sectors of society - experts, civil society, business, policymakers and donors - to develop informed, equitable and sustainable forms of governance. However, in a country such as Uganda, questions have been raised about the capacities of parliament to deliberate on complex issues as well as its actual power in scrutinising government. This is where scientific capacity building gains its impetus. While the rationale to intervene in African parliaments appears legitimate, practitioners of capacity building programmes struggle to reflect on the assumptions underpinning their work, in particular the relationship between knowledge and power; and local researchers are often not equipped with the skills and knowledge to do critical work at the science/society border that interrogates the effectiveness of donor programmes, and works to improve them in context.
 
This project aims to develop an impact agenda that addresses these gaps, and by doing so, capacity builds itself. The project aims to translate the research into the policymaking and practices of Ugandan (which include research participants, social scientists, scientists and researchers, donor and civil society organisations) and UK-based users (which include think tanks on development and science, donor agencies, and social scientists working in similar areas based at QMUL and other universities). Communicating with users will be accomplished through a structured dissemination path that involves publishing 2 journal articles and one single authored monograph, presenting at conferences, and attending seminars and reading groups. In addition, non-academic users in the UK and Uganda will be invited to participate in a series of four knowledge exchange events, in which they will be introduced and asked to engage in research design and data analysis. The research will be supported by a webpage and regular briefings will be sent to users, updating them on its progress at specific stages.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The new knowledge, insight and skills I will develop during this project will enable the use and interpretation of qualitative research evidence in the work of researchers, political communities and donor agencies in the UK, Uganda and beyond. The project is expected to produce new knowledge and understanding about science governance, democracy and development in a LMIC. It has the potential to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of relationships between the Ugandan parliament and the international donor community, improving the efficacy of collaborative programmes and strengthening the political and social capacities of researchers and practitioners to govern science and technology. The research is expected to contribute to all three ESRC strategic priorities: economic performance and sustainable growth, influencing behaviour and informing interventions and the creation of a vibrant and fair society. 

In developing my own research and leadership skills to manage a large research project and PGRA, I will acquire new skills and knowledge here at QMUL and elsewhere in the UK. These new skills will be applied to working in an international context in a complex and challenging area of research that is increasingly important to solving social problems related to health and biomedicine. The PGRA will have the opportunity to invest in their own professional and research development by being based at QMUL and having access to their range of training, and by also having access to training provided by other UK universities, as well as contributing to the dissemination and impact pathways of this project. 

The knowledge exchange skills I will develop during this project will benefit parliamentarians and supporting staff working in the Ugandan parliament, as well as those working in political institutions across East Africa. The project will also have the potential to benefit the work of international donors working in research and capacity building on areas related to biomedicine and health in African contexts and beyond. In addition, policy makers and practitioners in development will benefit from the evidence base and insights produced by the project. 

The workshop and communication activities that are part of this project form the base of a knowledge exchange plan that will outlast the life of the project, forging lasting relationships with a view to supporting future collaborations that work across international contexts. 

Building on my consultancy work with the UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology and the pilot study, this Future Research Leaders Grant will further strengthen my capacity to develop knowledge exchange and impact pathways from the emerging research results, forming the basis of a robust, socially responsive platform of research to take forward in my future academic career.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>249635</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Uganda National Academy of Sciences (UNAS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Uganda, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ugandan National Academy of Sciences</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B84AAEF-8AC7-4351-8300-BFCC368CF8F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The GCRF grant application is an outcome of this collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff99783f944.04808165-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>UNAS will contribute to the research project in terms of data, allowing me to follow and interview various members of the executive and steering committee.

The collaborating partners have all agreed to be interviewed and observed as part of the field research, they have participated in peer review exercises and writing groups, and in forging networks with research organisations in Uganda. 

In August, I established a weekly writing group with three principle parliamentary researchers whereby we sat together, wrote and then discussed and reviewed each other's work. This included writing from my own research project, and research and policy reports produced by parliamentary researchers. 

Through the seven month period I connected researchers with external organisations. Of particular note is the connection between the UN Pulse Lab (data science laboratory based in Kampala) and the researcher for the committee.
