This project seeks to correct this imbalance by looking at one of the most visible expressions of imperial power: the fortresses which proved to be key to the actual control of the lands coveted by Russia in Central Asia ('Great Game') and France in the Sahara ('Scramble for Africa'). The extension of lines of communication is a major weakness of conquering armies, especially when they operate in vast and sparsely populated areas such as the steppe or the Sahara. Consequently, fortresses initially designed to allow troops to rest and resupply sheltered from local enemy forces could easily become administrative centres designed to project the might of the new masters and impress indigenous populations. However, this was not always the case: some simply fell into decay once the conquest had taken place, because they were no longer strategically important once positions elsewhere had been strengthened.\n \nIn Russia, the process began with the construction of the Irgiz and Turgai fortifications in 1845, in response to the revolt of the Kazakh leader Kenesary Kasimov. Fort Raim (1847) near the mouth of the Syr-Darya was the first fortress of what became known as the 'Syr-Darya Line' of fortifications stretching through Kazalinsk to Aq-Masjid, upon which the Russians attempted (unsuccessfully) to build a stable frontier over the next twenty years. Simultaneously they were building a 'Siberian Line' of forts in the east, stretching down from Semipalatinsk through Kopal to the valley of Almaty. In the early 1860s, the two lines of fortresses were united, culminating in the fall of Tashkent in 1865, which marked the beginning of a new phase of the conquest, as the Russians moved from the steppe into the riverine oases of Turkestan.\n \nIn Algeria, the French were initially reluctant to penetrate deeper into the Sahara desert, having long questioned the real value of their colony of Algeria. However, the constant need to protect existing settlements or local allies from dissident activity meant that by the early 1890s, the French had built their first Saharan forts along a line of key strategic oases which gave them some control over trans-Saharan trade routes. As the conquest of West Africa progressed, a series of new fortresses accompanied the gradual seizure of the last expanses of land which still evaded French control: territories traditionally controlled by the Chaamba were taken at the turn of the century (1899-1905), paving the way to the seizure of the lands of the most powerful 'warlords of the desert', the Tuaregs, from 1900 to 1916. French mastery of the Sahara was fully achieved in the 1920s and 30s, when the last posts were set up in the middle of the oceans of sand of the Erg Chech.\n \nThese two instances of Imperial expansion are the pre-eminent example of European Imperialism in nomadic societies, and two of the most important examples of European expansion in the Islamic world. Furthermore, they both represent the conquest of territory of marginal economic value to the conquering power, and thus offer an excellent opportunity of applying theories of Imperial expansion developed in the study of the British empire to less well-known cases. \n\nThis project assesses both the historical significance of these 'outposts of conquest', their place in post-colonial Central Asia and North Africa, where they still remain powerful symbolic reminders of the colonial past, and their relationship with a harsh environment. Despite their importance in the process of military expansion, these fortresses have never been the subject of an academic study, and this project will bridge a major historiographical gap. Combining archival research with physical and photographic surveys, it will produce a comparative analysis of the past development and modern legacies of two major imperial strategies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has the potential to attract the attention of a broad spectrum of the general British public, combining as it does the traditional appeal of themes related to imperialism, military history and cultural encounters, with the novelty of the case studies considered and the historical interest of fortresses as loci of power and control. In both cases these fortresses are situated in desert or semi-desert zones, which are amongst the first to be feeling the impact of climate change, exacerbated in the Kazakh case by the Aral Sea disaster. This project will allow the general public to see what desertification actually means in practice, by comparing 19th-century images with those from the present day. 2012 is the fiftieth anniversary of Algerian independence, which will be marked by public events across Algeria, France and the rest of the world. The year 2013 will be an appropriate moment to remember and reappraise the structures and processes of French Imperialism in the region, and to consider them alongside the competing Imperial projects of the British and Russians.\nThe cornerstone of the impact plan is the combination of powerful visual material with archival and analytical approaches, which will allow us to disseminate results to a much wider audience than is usual for academic research. The fortresses which form the focus of the project were physical expressions of empire, concrete structures of control whose remains are a powerful reminder of the reality of imperial power. Their visual appearance is often as eloquent as the written records they generated. Equally, the landscape and environment in which they were situated was one of the main determinants of the reach and effectiveness of Imperial power, and it is almost impossible to communicate this without images of the surrounding terrain. The main visual element will be a photographic exhibition composed of twenty-four billboard-size panels produced by Dr S&amp;egrave;be, and which will allow us to employ hi skills as a photographer to communicate a historical message through detailed captions that convey the academic findings of the project. Alongside these will be high-quality reproductions of selected maps, plans and other archival or literary material, with translations and interpretative commentary from the PI and CI. These high-impact enlargements will be complemented by a set of twelve smaller panels detailing the history of these fortresses, developing a comparative dimension between Russian and French imperialism (whilst also drawing some parallels with the British Empire), and presenting their place in modern-day Kazakhstan and Algeria. The exhibition is designed to circulate, with the first showings planned in Birmingham, Liverpool and Oxford, to be followed by other venues, including London and abroad, therefore ensuring that the exhibition is made available to a geographically and culturally diverse public.\nAlongside the exhibition, the PI and CI will develop a schedule of illustrated lectures to a wide variety of audiences, whether in association with the exhibition showings, or as one-offs to provincial geographical societies, the Royal Geographical Society in London, the Travellers' Club, etc. Discussions are taking place with Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office officials with a view to presenting the results to a British diplomatic audience.\nTogether with the exhibition and the talks, the results of the project will be disseminated through a variety of targeted wider-audience publications which will complement the readership of the academic monograph: an illustrated photographic book, articles in Geographical and travel magazines, and reports in the local press in Britain, Algeria and Kazakhstan.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71984</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The ground-breaking exhibition concept exemplified by &amp;quot;Outposts of Conquest&amp;quot; relies on the combination of an open air street gallery presenting billboard-sized photographs and historical/geographical commentary (&amp;quot;Empires of Emptiness&amp;quot;: 9 triangular 'photographic islands' covering as many key themes = 27 panels) and an indoor exhibition (&amp;quot;Fortresses of the Sahara and the Steppe&amp;quot;) combining twenty-one large-format pictures of the current state of fortresses in the Sahara and Kazakhstan and nine historical panels showcasing the outcomes of the project on the basis of historical, archival and photographic material. This unique combination of indoor and outdoor displays, presented under one title as &amp;quot;Empires of Emptiness: Fortresses of the Sahara and the Steppe&amp;quot; is designed to maximise the socio-cultural impact of the research.

Despite the seemingly limited 'value' of arid spaces and the significant logistical difficulties they posed, the conquest of deserts has often mobilised sizeable resources from some of the world's most notable empires.

Presenting the results of the Birmingham-led research project Outposts of Conquest, this exhibition explores one of the most symbolically charged expressions of imperial control in desert environments: the Russian fortifications in the Central Asian steppe and the vast network of French forts built in an attempt to control the Sahara desert. The comparison shows how these two Christian colonial powers sought to control Muslim and predominantly nomad populations.

The Rotunda exhibition (thirty panels ranging from 60 x 80 cm to 120 x 180 cm) is complemented by an outdoor display (27 panels size 140 x 180 cm) across University Square and Chancellors Court. Sahara &amp;amp; the Steppe contextualises the geographical and human environment where these fortresses were built. The vanity of these imperial fortresses, guarding these barren landscapes, appears even more clearly, and the stories behind these sentinels of the void, even more mysterious.

The exhibition, shown between 15 February and 23 May 2016, was viewed by thousands of visitors belonging to the University of Birmingham and to the wider city of Edgbaston and Birmingham. The feedback gathered on the occasion of the event was extremely positive, with many respondents testifying that it has changed their perception of desert spaces and that it had enhanced their understanding of how empires work. The exhibition's relevance to British society was frequently mentioned in feedback.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c03fb8745d31.82785892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/lcahm/departments/languages/sections/french/events/2016/empires-emptiness.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UoB Culture Festival, March 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E00794E6-C9AC-4891-832B-BC504CB1259D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This lecture ('Looking for Traces of Empires, from Kazakhstan to Algeria: Military Architecture in Russian and French Colonies') given as part of the University of Birmingham's Culture Festival, and in partnership with the 'Postcolonial Birmingham' Research Network offered us an excellent opportunity to share our results with an informed audience of non-academics (as well as a few academic colleagues), and to test the reactions of the general public to our research questions, with a view to using these results to maximize the effectiveness of our future pathways to impact.

The comparison between these two Christian powers encroaching in the nineteenth century into territories inhabited by Muslim and nomadic populations reveals their common preoccupation for the safety of their troops and administrative personnel, but also significant differences. Whilst the Russians used their fortresses in present-day Kazakhstan for a limited period and even destroyed them when they judged that they controlled the territory, in the French case they remained a pivotal element in the colonial structure up until the independence of Algeria in 1962. Variations in the terrain upon which imperial control was sought certainly played a role, but so did national traditions: the Gallic fascination with fortifications ever since Vauban has to be factored in. In the Russian empire, fortresses were 'outposts of conquest', whereas in the French Saharan colony they quickly became seats of administrative and military power. Whilst fortresses initially served the same purposes in each colonial project, their long-term use varied significantly and reveals profound differences the strategies of imperial control of each power. The investigators are currently looking at the long-term consequences of these differences in present-day Kazakhstan and Algeria, and the way in which they have shaped distinctive administrative and strategic traditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Tourism and Heritage industries
