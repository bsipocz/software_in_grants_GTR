Speech production is highly variable both across and within speakers. This is partly due to differences in the vocal tract anatomy and partly under the control of the speaker. This project examines whether clearer speakers are more extreme in their articulations (as measured from the acoustic properties of their speech) or whether they are more consistent in their production of speech sounds. In order to better model natural communication, the speech to be analysed is recorded using a new task aimed at eliciting spontaneous dialogue with specific keywords. The first study investigates whether 'inherent' speaker clarity is consistent across different types of discourse and whether speaker clarity is more closely correlated with cross-category differences or within-category consistency in production. The second study investigates whether clearer speakers show a greater degree of adaptation to the needs of listeners. This study has implications for models of speech perception. Understanding what makes a 'clear speaker' will also be informative for applications requiring clear communication, such as teaching, speech and language therapy, and the selection of voices for clinical testing and for speech technology applications.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>311969</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Noisy world exhibit - Royal Society summer exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D882DA6D-005A-43F9-B934-35E90DEFDE9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our modern world is full of noise: from machinery, transport, radio &amp;amp; television, MP3 players, and other people talking. This exhibit showed how background noises of all types affect our ability to understand speech, and makes it harder for us to think about and remember things. 

The exhibit involved a live demonstration of the diapix task and test conditions that we used in our project to record interactions between two speakers in good and adverse conditions.

Our work received great exposure as the result of our inclusion in the RS Summer Exhibition. It was features on Radio 4 and the website and other materials developed for the Summer Exhibition were very useful tools for further dissemination. We also recruited some participants who found out about our work at the exhibition.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1002263157.63058442b62a064</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://royalsociety.org/summer-science/2011/noisy-world/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited lecture: Clear speech strategies in speaker-listener interactions</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EE03874-B6BF-4087-A15B-AAB414828907</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture - Research colloquium series, MARCS Laboratories, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.

We analysed the acoustic-phonetic characteristics of the speech produced by 40 speakers (while hearing normally) when interacting with interlocutors experiencing these three different types of communication barrier (VOC, BABBLE, L2). We found that the acoustic-phonetic enhancements made were tailored to counteract a specific adverse condition. Relative to their conversational speech, talkers spoke with higher and more varied pitch range and greater mid-frequency energy when clarifying their speech for an interlocutor hearing them in noise, but did not change these characteristics when clarifying their speech for an interlocutor hearing them via a noise-excited vocoder, where most pitch information is lost and audibility thresholds not an issue. Talkers made these specific adjustments even though not directly experiencing the adverse listening condition As proposed by Lindblom's Hyper-Hypo theory, speech production appeared to be guided by the needs of the listener to the cost of greater effort for the speaker. Perception experiments showed a significant link between improvement in clarity ratings between the casual and VOC condition and degree of acoustic-phonetic change. Talkers' clarity measures were significantly correlated across different diapix conditions: although talkers became clearer in the VOC and BABBLE conditions, their clarity 'ranking' remained consistent relative to their inherent clarity in the 'no barrier' condition. 



We also compared the type of clear speech naturally elicited due to communicative needs with clear speech obtained when participants were instructed to read sentences clearly. Clear read speech was found to have more extreme acoustic-phonetic enhancements than clear spontaneous speech, as more consistently hyper-articulated. 



We investigated the relation between the internal structure of phonetic categories and consonant intelligibility for two phonetic contrasts. Measures of cross-category distance (CCD) (i.e., the difference between two sound categories) and within-category dispersion (WCD) (i.e., of the variability within each sound category) were obtained using 32 iterations per category for each of 40 speakers. These measures varied substantially across talkers but were not correlated across contrasts suggesting a lack of within-talker consistency in CCD and WCD. Consonant identification data for eight talkers presenting extremes of CCD or WCD revealed some talker effects on reaction time, but these were not correlated with either of the two measures. We found no significant correlations between CCD or WCD measures and broader measures of clarity or communication effectiveness in the diapix tasks. We conclude that the conclusions of Newman et al (2001) were premature and that a talker's consistency of production or contrast salience does not appear to be directly correlated with their inherent intelligibility.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The diapixUK materials that we developed for this project could be further developed for clinical use by speech and language therapists. They are appropriate for use with children as well as adults, and a simple measure of transaction time provides a general measure of communication efficiency. The speech that is recorded can be analysed to investigate aspects of communication such as clarification requests, repair strategies, lexical diversity. The complete corpus of speech recordings and aligned orthographic transcriptions is available online (LUCID corpus), and is made available to other researchers on request.

The diapixUK picture materials are also available for use by other researchers. They have been constructed so that they can easily be adapted for other research purposes.
