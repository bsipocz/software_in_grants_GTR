The doctoral study was set within Welsh higher education and evaluated the progress which had been made towards achieving equality and inclusion for disabled students studying in Wales. 
The programme of work included:
- Revising the doctoral thesis for publication, which required a limited amount of new research. 
- Writing three journal articles.
- Presenting papers at UK and international conferences and seminars.
- Disseminating research findings to user groups.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>69D091C1-E056-4E68-A13C-B80EB078647B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464c82aac3d21.00907888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The postdoctoral fellowship was used to develop and disseminate research findings from Karen Beauchamp-Pryor's doctoral study. The doctoral study was set within Welsh higher education and evaluated the progress which had been made towards achieving equality and inclusion for disabled students studying in Wales. Whilst extensive research had been undertaken in Scotland and England relating to the developments in disability policy and provision in higher educational institutions, the evaluation of disability policy and provision in Wales, and the experiences of disabled Welsh students, had been overlooked. The overall objectives of the thesis formed a framework for securing the equality and inclusion of disabled students in higher education, and this reflected the important issues of control, choice and consultation. Although previous research has evaluated these issues in other areas of policy, such as health and social care, no detailed investigation has been undertaken in relation to the experiences of disabled students. 

The postdoctoral fellowship provided the opportunity to:

- consolidate ideas for presentation and publication.
- develop established links to reach a wider group of users outside of the research community.

and to develop and strengthen skills in:

- writing for publication.
- presenting papers at conferences and seminars.
- preparing a grant application for further research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further research is critical to determine the progress that has been made in Wales towards securing equality and inclusion for disabled students in higher education and to question the impact of recent disability legislation (the Disability Discrimination Act 2005) in challenging the inequality and exclusion that previous research has identified (Barnes 1991; Hurst 1993; Leicester and Lovell 1995; Hall and Healey 2004; Riddell et al 2005; Beauchamp-Pryor 2008, 2013). 
More specifically:
1. How effective is UK disability and equality legislation in challenging the inequality and exclusion experienced by disabled students in higher education? 
2. What are the policy implications for disabled students studying in Welsh higher education and how is the Welsh Assembly Government responding? 
3. What sort of impact has the involvement of disabled stakeholders had in the development of Disability Equality Schemes. 
4. Has the dominant ideology within higher education policy and practice changed to reflect an equality approach? 
5. Are the views of disabled students drawn upon in wider aspects of policy and practice? 
6. How important is involvement to disabled students?
7. How effective is involvement in increasing student independence and, as a consequence, the experience of inclusion?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D1D43965-CB27-4892-9808-34B595A97613</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464ce37344677.50276519</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2CE72D66-72EA-48EC-BFBD-39BC86C6A02D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impairment, cure and identity: 'where do I fit in?'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Disability &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/642cb86ded42ad94cbc0c42daf8291d2"><gtr:id>642cb86ded42ad94cbc0c42daf8291d2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BeauchampPryor K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9bf9b1f851ec</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>076CB3F5-FA98-4867-8524-A71F21C057B0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Changes in the political and policy response towards disabled students in the British higher education system: a journey towards inclusion</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/954b2118b9392d94a5e8041a4efd237e"><gtr:id>954b2118b9392d94a5e8041a4efd237e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beauchamp-Pryor K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5448cbbc26acd3.25840986</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C443D5E1-A38A-44BB-8BD1-D6092D69081F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disabled Students in Welsh Higher Education: A Framework for Equality and Inclusion</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b62900854c6e9c0beff052f8db65630f"><gtr:id>b62900854c6e9c0beff052f8db65630f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beauchamp-Pryor Karen</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9789462093430</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_19584005153b91e03e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>544C1E96-4997-4B97-9F05-EB8289F4EA8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>From absent to active voices: securing disability equality within higher education</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Inclusive Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/954b2118b9392d94a5e8041a4efd237e"><gtr:id>954b2118b9392d94a5e8041a4efd237e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beauchamp-Pryor K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9bf9bf672e88</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G029970/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
