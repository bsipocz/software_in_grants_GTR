Greater capability (~10 GW) to store electricity will save the UK energy spend of up to &amp;pound;10 billion a year by 2050, and will provide flexibility for energy supply, as pointed out by the Rt Hon David Willetts MP in &amp;quot;Eight Great Technologies&amp;quot;. It will also facilitate the increased use of intermittent renewable energies (such as wind, wave and tidal) on the grid to meet binding emission targets (for example, 80% CO2 reduction by 2050) and thus enable the faster transition to a low carbon society. This calls for low cost and sustainable energy storage technologies. Na ion batteries (NIBs) have recently attracted increasing interest worldwide, because of the natural abundance, wide availability and low cost of Na resources. They may be more economically viable than lithium-based batteries in the context of grid storage and can support the UK's and even the world-wide demand for electricity storage. The development of NIBs has, however, been very slow in the UK, compared to other competitors such as USA, Japan and China. This project aims to make advancements in NIBs with a focus on anode materials. 

This project proposes the use of low cost and aboundant nanoporous carbons materials (particularly biomass derived carbon aerogels) as anode materials in NIBs. This proposal details a necessary step by providing a design tool for selection and optimisation of nanoporous carbons in this application. The hypothesis of the research is that computational models can be used to design desirable porous carbons for NIBs. The model development will be supported and validated by experimental activities including characterisation of real nanoporous carbons, assembly and testing of NIB cells. 

Molecular models will be developed at two levels - a single pore model and a more complicated virtual porous carbon model. Hetreatoms (such as H, O, B, N, P, S) in the forms of doped atoms in the carbon lattices, and funcational groups, will be introduced, for the first time, to reflect the real atomic structures of porous carbons. Molecular simulations will be performed on the models to reveal Na ion intercalation mechanism in nanoporous carbons and the effects of pore sizes and presence of heteroatoms on the adsorption, diffusion and charge transfer processes. Desirable characteristics of porous carbons will be generated. These desirable charateristics will be used to guide the fabrication and optimisation of real nanoporous carbons. 

This project is underpinned by a fully funded PhD studentship at Surrey, which will enable the prediction and the understanding from molecular simulations to be directly translated into real applications. Biomass derived nanoporous carbon aerogels, produced at Queen Mary University of London (UK), will be used to manufacture NIB cells at University of Surrey for electrochemical performance testing. Nanoporous carbons of other origin will be produced at CIC-Energigune (Spain) and used in battery cell manufacturing and testing. The project is also strongly supported by Johnson Matthey on materials characterization, battery testing, and advice on prototype opportunities. 

This project is the natural result of the PI's expertise in molecular simulation, nanoporous carbon materials and electrode design for electrochemical devices. The framework of the proposed work will be underpinned by extensive energy materials characterisation expertise and infrastructure, as well as extensive expertise and facilities in battery manufacturing and testing at Surrey.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to make advancement of Na-ion battery (NIB) technology. The project will lead multidisciplinary research to enable tuning of materials for improved performance and faster development of NIB technology. 

The successful delivery of this project will lead to production of prototype NIB cells and future commercialisation of this technology, which provides a cheaper, cleaner, safer and sustainable energy storage solution. Moreover, molecular models of nanoporous carbons from this research could facilitate the design of carbons in supercapacitors, Li-air batteries and low-temperature fuel cells, with important impact on those industries.

Commercial beneficiaries of the research (wealth generation in 10 - 25 years) will be companies in the UK and worldwide in, or part of the supply chain for, NIB technology. More specifically, in the 5 - 15 year window, UK industry will directly benefit if the outcomes of the research lead to more developed and focussed academic-industry collaborations (Technology Strategy Board / Knowledge Transfer Partnerships). The potential IP that could be generated in the area of NIB technology for energy storage will yield opportunities for spin-out companies, providing employment opportunities and adding value to the UK economy.

Societal beneficiaries will include, for example:
- greater energy storage capacity in the UK and thus huge saving in energy bills for the public;
- large-scale employment of renewable energies (in the UK, particularly wind, wave and tidal energy) and thus the transition to a low carbon society;
- enhancement of UK's energy security and environmental sustainability.

In short-term (1-3 years), this project will provide highly skilled researchers who will have developed multidisciplinary skills and will have experienced a broad range of technological fields that are important for R&amp;amp;D programmes required for market innovation for NIB technology and beyond. 

The PI will benefit several new collaborations with Johnson Matthey, Queen Mary University of London and CIC-Energigune (Spain), above established collaborations associated with her current research programmes. The UK-based and international partners are committed to supporting aspects of this project within their own research capacity. Further collaborations with leading groups and the development of multidisciplinary research projects will be fostered during this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99084</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen Mary University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Mathematical Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Synthesis of nanoporous carbon materials for sodium ion batteries</gtr:description><gtr:id>E81B67AE-6CAD-47D1-9F4E-878A73410832</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research project is still on-going, and we hope to report the outcomes later.

The findings from this project on designing carbon materials for sodium ion storage have been transferred to another electrochemical technology for water purification. We have been working with a SME based in the UK, to develop a stand-alone system for providing clean drinking water for people living in remote areas.

It is found that when carbon materials supplied with negative charges, pores smaller than 2nm are more favourable for obtaining high sodium ion storage density. Particularly high sodium ion storage density is obtained with pores smaller than 1 nm, at increased charges. This means that, to have high sodium ion storage capacity, we need to make carbon materials with pores dominantly smaller than 1 nm. 

We also find that, if the electrolyte solvent molecules have strong interactions with sodium ions (such as ethylene carbonate) to form three-dimensional clusters, it becomes difficult for sodium ions to come into the nanopores, in which case electrical energy needs to be applied to overcome the attraction energy from the solvent molecules, in order for sodium ions to come into carbon nanopores. This effect of overcoming solvent attraction is more obvious with small pores. For example, in pores below 1 nm, sodium ions can come into pores without solvent molecules. Our study shows that it is important to include solvent molecules in the simulation, in order to accurately capture all the relevant interactions and thus the real battery system. Furthermore, both the charges and pore sizes of the carbon materials affect the orientations and molecular configurations of solvent molecules in carbon nanopores. We think this may affect how solvent molecules react with carbon materials to form the solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) and future studies should endeavour to unravel the reaction mechanisms in the formation of the SEI layer, a key determining factor in battery performance. 

This project has enabled my group to start a new line of research in sodium ion batteries, by combined modelling and experimental efforts. Through the project, my group have developed methods of simulating battery systems containing the solid electrode material and the liquid electrolyte, by representing the atomic interactions explicitly. The methods are useful for investigating other battery systems, and have laid a step-stone towards developing new research. The methods have also been extended to pharmaceutical product design research in a PhD project. 

This project has enabled my group to develop collaborations with international research groups in Chiba University (Japan), Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter-Chinese Academy of Sciences (China), CIC-Energigune (Spain), and Queen Mary University of London (UK). It has also enabled my group to build network with international groups in Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (South Korea) and Pennsylvania State University (USA). These collaborations and links have enhanced the visibility of my group and led to new research ideas which are under development for research proposals and joint publications. 

This project has enabled the training of an experienced postdoctoral researcher and diversified his research into a new field. This has led to the secure of a permanent research position for the researcher, at Luxemburg Institute of Science and Technology. We have kept collaborations and will continue to collaborate in research. The project has also enabled the training of a British PhD student on the fabrication and testing of sodium ion battery cells. A number of MEng final year students have been involved in the experimental study of sodium ion batteries. We have obtained promising experimental results which are under considerations for patents and publications. The PhD student, and the MEng students will be the work force for next generation electrochemical energy storage technologies and the driving force for innovation in new energy storage technologies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from this project has been desseminated in two peer-reviewed publications so far, with more peer-reviewed publications to come. The findings have also been desseminated at a number of international conferences including the 229th ECS (Electrochemical Society) meeting is USA, the 67th annual meeting of the International Society of Electrochemistry in the Netherlands, the 2nd international conferecen on Advanced Energy Materials in the UK, and the UK-Korea Forum on Li and Na Batteries in the UK.

The research methods developed in this project can be taken by other researchers to investigate battery systems. In fact, we have been transferring the methods and findings to colleagues in Chiba University and Chinese Academy of Sciences, to help them start new line of research.

The finding on the optimal pore sizes for sodium ion storage can be used by materials scientists (from universities or companies) to make high capacity carbon materials for sodium ion batteries. In fact, we have transferred the findings to our collaborators in Queen Mary for making desirable materials for sodium ion batteries. 

The methods can also be used to help design materials for other applications for example removal of salts and adsorption of contaminants in water. In fact, my group have been in discussion with a research group at Tsinghua University (China) specialised in water treatment, to use the methods for designing desirable materials for removing water contaminants. The methods we developed in this project can also be used to train undergraduate, master and PhD students for research skills in a broad sense. 

The findings on the importance of including electrolyte in simulations might be taken by the research community to develop more realistic model systems and improved understandings. In fact, my group are taking this forward to investigate the effect of different electrolyte salts and organic solvents on sodium ion storage. We hope this will lead to the optimization of salts and organic solvents choice for the advancement of sodium ion batteries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>488EBC45-97E5-4B9D-A0AA-B998CA220AA3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9760a58a6c0.47654584</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Energy,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.surrey.ac.uk/cpe/people/dr_cai_qiong/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E957389A-DE97-46C6-A6F0-02D57982112F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effect of different organic solvents on sodium ion storage in carbon nanopores.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/eb230b33de24ec16d2c3abba9faa6f3c"><gtr:id>eb230b33de24ec16d2c3abba9faa6f3c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Karatrantos A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1463-9076</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a995b4734f194.72661856</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66E658D2-8A74-489B-85F0-099743647FEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Design of Nanoporous Carbons as Anode Materials for Sodium (Na) Ion Batteries</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ECS Transactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/eb230b33de24ec16d2c3abba9faa6f3c"><gtr:id>eb230b33de24ec16d2c3abba9faa6f3c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Karatrantos A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c96b4243ec92.05762442</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5778B659-162C-4DD4-91D7-32BB9F2FE001</gtr:id><gtr:title>A High-Volumetric-Capacity Cathode Based on Interconnected Close-Packed N-Doped Porous Carbon Nanospheres for Long-Life Lithium-Sulfur Batteries</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advanced Energy Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/03abd0e39274cc4fcaebad650914c898"><gtr:id>03abd0e39274cc4fcaebad650914c898</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hu C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fefb4b086a7.68343210</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>51869063-3D39-43A4-96CE-7540891CAC0A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of pore size and surface charge on Na ion storage in carbon nanopores.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/eb230b33de24ec16d2c3abba9faa6f3c"><gtr:id>eb230b33de24ec16d2c3abba9faa6f3c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Karatrantos A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1463-9076</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d7ea2bf7ee2.15293801</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M027066/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
