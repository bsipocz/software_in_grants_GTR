Since many structures in mathematics and the basic sciences are very symmetrical, applications of groups abound in these areas. From the predictions of particle physics to error correcting codes that enable compact discs to reproduce clear sound even when dirty or scratched, many areas of science utilise some group theory.

One theme that runs throughout much of the research carried out in Southampton is the study of geometric objects, or spaces, whose symmetries embody the given group. The symmetry of crystals, for example, has been well understood using groups, the so called crystallographic groups.

Crystallographic groups are examples of groups admitting a finite dimensional model for the classifying space for proper actions, which has come to prominence through its connection with the celebrated Baum-Connes conjecture. In this project we shall investigate some weaker, algebraically or, to be more precise, homologically, defined invariants characterising groups admitting a finite dimensional model for the classifying space for proper actions. This work will enable us to make progress in answering some long-standing conjectures in the field. 

In particular, we shall concentrate on groups having unbounded torsion, for which the answers to these questions are still unknown. As a starting point we will concentrate on Branch groups, a relatively new and extremely vibrant area in geometric group theory. 
Originated by Gromov in 1991, the study of quasi-isometry invariants has become a very important and active area in pure mathematics. The aim is to understand which ho- mological properties of finitely generated groups are large scale geometric properties, i.e. are preserved by quasi-isometry. Recently, the seminal work of Y. Shalom and R. Sauer introduced methods from homological algebra and representation theory to the area proving quasi-isometry invariance of various homological finiteness conditions. One aim of the project is, by extending their work, to understand the homological invariants mentioned above.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In common with most curiosity driven research prevalent in Pure Mathematics, the impact of this project will mainly lie within Mathematics. Since this project spans topics from Algebraic Topology, Homological Algebra and Geometric Group Theory, it will mainly impact on those areas, see the Section &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot;.
This project will have considerable impact on the research of the proposed PDRA, Giovanni Gandini, who is currently at a crucial and promising stage of his career, having the potential to be one of the internationally leading young researchers in geometric group theory. He will be reconnecting with one of the leading geometric group theory groups in the UK, which is embedded in a diverse Pure Mathematics group with a large number of researchers specialising in areas of interest close to his. It is expected that there will be a considerable amount of interaction with I. Leary as well as with M. Kassabov, A. Martino and G. Niblo, whose research interests overlap with those of the visitor. By also visiting M. Bridson (Oxford) and P. Kropholler (Glasgow) he will widen his contacts and potential collaborations within the UK.
The PI will be able to expand her field of expertise into contributing to important areas of geometric group theory such as Branch groups and quasi-isometry invariants. She will be able to expand her international group of collaborators and increase the impact of her research within the mathematics community.
Our new approach to problems based at the interface of algebraic topology and geometric group theory will be raising the standard of research in the UK. In particular, researchers in Oxford and Glasgow will benefit from G. Gandini's visits. Also researchers in Warwick, Edinburgh and Newcastle shall benefit from the findings of this project. Naturally, one beneficiary will be the School of Mathematics in Southampton. We expect intensive interaction with I. Leary and also M. Kassbaov, A. Martino and G. Niblo. Since we expect this collaboration to be of a long term nature, the impact is also expected to be of a long term nature.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22479</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our preliminary work on complete cohomology for profinite groups led to an exciting Ph.D project: Under my supervision at Royal Holloway, University of London, Ged Corob Cook is currently investigating cohomological finiteness conditions for a hierarchically defined class of groups and has already produced some surprising results, which will be published in due course.

2016: This project is now finished and the student has obtained his Ph.D proving a conjecture of P.Kropholler on torsion-free soluble profinite groups.
The student has now taken up a postdoctoral position with P. Kropholler at the University of Southampton on an EPSRC funded project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7836399D-21F8-47B2-BEF7-A57D3981C66E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544a43e68823a5.38672088</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As a major outcome in this award, we managed to provide a large group of examples satisfying a 25-year old (and still unsolved) conjecture by Kropholler and Mislin.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These results are of interest to other researchers working in the field, and are working on the above mentioned conjecture.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AA1FC359-543A-4C0A-B62A-69A68E37FF9B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a42ff1cac81.18884804</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D723DB59-8EDE-477A-8BEF-17425AD3A89F</gtr:id><gtr:title>On hierarchies in profinite groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>in preparation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35a9e764044812667077e6c1d04397c5"><gtr:id>35a9e764044812667077e6c1d04397c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giovanni Gandini (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_9578341784136a082a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E2ED4B00-B4EB-4132-A0C1-969369452D8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Some 1-groups with unbounded torsion and a conjecture of Kropholler and Mislin</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forum Mathematicum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0895b3c205b41ddcdec516799d30751a"><gtr:id>0895b3c205b41ddcdec516799d30751a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gandini G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f974974dcdc93c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>55C79F58-3740-4FDA-BE86-099AE137ECE8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Some H1F-groups with unbounded torsion and a conjecture of Kropholler and Mislin</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forum Mathematicum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0283b30b4d84d2cb580c8af6e54b24e7"><gtr:id>0283b30b4d84d2cb580c8af6e54b24e7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Giovanni Gandini</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_592141960413773612</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J016993/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
