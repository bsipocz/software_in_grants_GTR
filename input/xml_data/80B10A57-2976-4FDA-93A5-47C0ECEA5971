harm to themselves or others; there is a risk of injury to both the individual and to the
attendees (typically the front line services including the police, paramedics, nurses, doctors
and prison officers. The number of restraint related deaths and injuries have not been reduced
by recommendations and changes to guidelines, and the use of controversial techniques
including the face-down ?prone? restraint continues.
Our project aim is to develop an innovative lightweight, compact, metal-free and multiposition
stretcher that conforms to all the provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive
93/42/EEC (2002), ISO 13485 Medical Devices and the US FDA 880-8760 ? Protective
Devices
The proposed ProtoMedic+ stretcher will have the following benefits:
? CE marked, meeting all UK, European and USA regulations
? Lightweight and foldable for easy storage and carriage
? Multi-position with harnesses enables ProtoMedic+ to be used for a variety of
restraint and medical applications
? X-ray translucent, MRI, defibrillator friendly
? Compatible with existing ambulance stretcher trolleys and the internationally
recognised Evac+Chair
? Suitable for a diverse range of applications including public order, custody, prison,
mental health, disaster and combat rescue, and post-trauma immobilisation.
To deliver the benefits the following enabling innovations have been identified:
? Plastic hinge mechanism will enable multi-position and folding
? Integrated wheels will enable easy transportation in wheelchair position
? Multi-point harnesses enables bespoke restraint and immobilisation applications
? Modular lightweight design allows for component building and product extensions
Market testing with front line services has already identified a social and commercial need.

improve public safety.

Update:- 

Throughout the development process UKDI Ltd have continually and consistently engaged with end users gaining their confidence and respect. Their work involved and included all front line service providers actively engaged in dealing with individuals exhibiting challenging behaviour. In addition the consultation exercise undertaken by UKDI has involved other front line services where the emphasis has been more on medical recovery/protection than physical restraint.
While this process had always been intended as part and parcel of dissemination and exploitation of the potential markets in building relationships between UKDI/Evac+Chair and their customers/consumer base it very soon became apparent that something much more significant was developing. 
This ?bridge building? exercise had succeeded in gaining the confidence and trust of end users who through the presentation exercises of the earlier concept models began to identify much greater potential usage of the stretcher across the whole spectrum of medical recovery, patient transportation, movement etc. Because UKDI readily accepted the thoughts, observations and suggestions made by end users and where appropriate, feasible and technically possible have included those in the final concept, the market potential for the product has now significantly increased to that detailed in the original application. 

This development has been confirmed when a full Medical Review of the product was recently undertaken by Dr Tony Bleetman FRCS, Consultant in Accident and Medical Emergency, in his capacity as the leading authority on the use of restraint both in terms of the UK and World Wide. Dr Bleetman?s expectations were that the stretcher would be called into use by at least the following services, RNLI, Search &amp;amp; Rescue, Ambulance Paramedics (including Air Ambulance Crews), MoD (Combat) Sports/Football clubs etc, etc in addition to those already contacted by UKDI ie Police, HM Prison Service, UK Borders Agency (repatriation), High Security Psychiatric Units as well as Medium and Low Security Units and A&amp;amp;E Departments. Given the interest already expressed by overseas agents via UKTI, we expect this to be replicated Worldwide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">720500</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
