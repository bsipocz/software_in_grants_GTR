This was funded jointly by NERC and the Met Office with an overarching aim of ensuring that the UK maintains and strengthens its leading international position in climate science, and hence in climate forecasting and provision of advice for climate policy. In its initial phase, five joint research posts and a Programme Manager post were created. The five research posts covered areas of existing collaboration that were considered as priorities for further development by NERC and the Met Office. The JCRP also established a jointly-owned partition (MONSooN) of the new Met Office supercomputer to enable NERC and Met Office scientists to share data and run models on the same platform. It was recognised that the areas of joint interest in both research and facilities extend beyond climate, good examples being the jointly owned research aircraft and existing cooperation on the Argo float programme. Following the ground-breaking development of the JCRP and the level of co-operation that has ensued, it is clear that the benefits of broadening the scope of the JCRP to encompass all areas of joint interest could be substantial. In addition, the increasing appreciation of the seamless nature of weather and climate and the importance of fundamental oceanic and atmospheric processes and weather phenomena in climate prediction is driving a move towards a more unified approach to weather and climate research. These factors have led to the programme being renamed the Joint Weather &amp;amp; Climate Research Programme, JWCRP</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2100000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Meteorological Office UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>JWCRP partnership between NERC (University of Reading) and Met Office</gtr:description><gtr:id>D198B580-2811-4DEF-991E-607D46B560E7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two joint journal papers between University of Reading and Met Office co-authors on monsoon modelling.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c33612f12dd2.38338217-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Met Office provided desk space for visits by the PDRA in addition to supervisory support and informal collaboration.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This was one of the initial JWCRP projects between NERC-funded research in universities and the Met Office.

They both work towards understanding and improving errors in the simulation of the Asian monsoon in weather and climate models. Most weather and climate models (including the UK Met Office model) fail to properly simulate the Asian monsoon, in particular by showing far too little rainfall over India.

Firstly, we examined the role played by a key piece of the convection scheme, the part of the model the controls rainfall in the tropics. We found that rainfall over India and in nearby regions is very sensitive to a particular parameter in the convection scheme that controls the mixing between moist and dry air. Altering this parameter could improve and increase the rainfall over India. However some rainfall errors elsewhere get worse, and there is little observational basis for setting the parameter at a particular level. More information can be read here: https://ncas.ac.uk/index.php/en/climate-science-highlights/2320-changes-in-simulated-tropical-rainfall-due-to-increased-resolution%20and%20https://ncas.ac.uk/index.php/en/climate-science-highlights/2090-understanding-errors-in-simulations-of-tropical-rainfall

Secondly, the JWCRP Modelling Monsoon Systems project assessed the impact of increasing the horizontal resolution of a climate model (the spacing of the gridsquares). We compared global models with resolutions of approximately 125km, 60km and 30km grid spacing. At higher resolutions, the locations of rainfall over India and Southeast Asia are improved, particularly nearby to mountain ranges. This is because the mountains are more noticeable when a higher resolution is used. The rainfall over the islands of Indonesia is also displayed better.
