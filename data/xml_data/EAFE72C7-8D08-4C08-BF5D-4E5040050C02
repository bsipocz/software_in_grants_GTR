Understanding</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K005987/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>At a time of serious conflict across the world, the purpose of this application to the AHRC Research Networking scheme is to create a forum for experts with diverse perspectives and experiences to reflect critically on the diverse roles, quality and purpose of visual art produced during and after conflict. Participants will include academics, artists, and representatives of arts commissioning bodies, charities and government. 30 members of the network will meet 4 times in workshops over 12 months across Britain. These events - organised by theme rather than by geography - will feature international participants with considerable experience of making and commissioning art in this context. 
Visual art has played an active and diverse part in recent and current conflicts. Artists in Syria, Belarus and other countries have been imprisoned, abused or bullied into exile. This is in stark contrast to the historic practice of commissioning a 'war artist' to record and witness events. This can again be contrasted with the role of artists employed by charities and development agencies to work at the site of conflict in more instrumental ways to help alleviate trauma or to bridge ethnic differences. These various practices raise significant questions about artistic autonomy, the responsibilities which accompany representation and the politics of memory. These issues are heightened by shifts within contemporary art itself. Increasingly produced and consumed outside the gallery, art often takes the form of interventions into public space that are designed to produce immediate and unpredictable public responses and participation, as well as the attention of the mass and social media. There is much interest in producing 'social engagement' through art. The workshops will ask what effects can and do such schemes produce? Are there examples of art levering real and sustainable change? 
This is not only a topical proposal: it is one which aspires to shape future practice. The global context presents an unprecedented set of challenges beyond the sadly familiar ones of compromised human rights and the effects of inequality and inequity. Population growth is highly likely to become one of the greatest threats to peace in the future. Developing nations are becoming consumer societies, adding hugely to the strain on diminishing natural resources. It is widely predicted that wars over these resources will increase and intensify unless we act constructively. As these different challenges impact on each other, we urgently need new perspectives and a diversity of means in response. What is the potential of the visual arts in this unstable future?
The UK context for this network is important. The country is implicated in a number of conflicts by its history and by its present activities, most recently and actively in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. Journalists and politicians, NGOs and other activists - and the armed services - have also been engaged in various ventures in Egypt, Lebanon, the Balkans, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Syria, Israel and Palestine and elsewhere. What are the responsibilities of UK-based artists and NGOs when they operate outside the UK? How critical can art be of the operations of the State? 
The objectives of this scheme are to improve the quality of exchange between people working in the arts sector and development agencies and, in particular, to improve and guide the process of commissioning art. The workshops will be paralleled by the activities of a steering group which will develop a major application to develop an international research project into culture and conflict which will, perhaps, embrace other areas of the arts and have full international partners. To provide important resources and perspectives for the wider academic community and the public - who are keenly interested in the issues raised here - material presented at the workshops will be published on-line and in print.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As a research network, the immediate non-academic beneficiaries of the project will be the participants in the workshops - artists, curators, representatives of NGOs, charities and government. Invitations to participate will be extended to trusts and foundations (Prince Claus Fund, for example); governmental organisations (including the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Conflict). Active in key aspects of making, commissioning or critiquing art produced in the aftermath of conflict, commissioners will have opportunities to examine current practices across the sector and potentially to improve practices in the field. Those NGOs and charitable bodies which, for instance, have had relatively little experience of commissioning art will have a serious opportunity to evaluate and improve their own practices and develop 'tools' for evaluating the impact of art in the context of conflict. This may well result in better commissioning practices. 

Visual artists will also form another order of beneficiaries. Whether directly participating in the workshops or accessing the related materials on-line, they will have opportunities to better understand the interests and activities of agencies working in conflict resolution. 

Curators and educators outside the university sector will also be addressed by this network. Representatives of the Federation of International Human Rights Museums will be invited to participate. This body represents museums which deal with sensitive and controversial subjects such as the Holocaust and human rights and has a remit to share new thinking and initiatives in the field. Participating educators - whether those teaching the children of those who came to Britain as refugees or curating public exhibitions - will have opportunities to better understand the ways in which traumatic memories of conflict can be given form in the visual arts. The longer term benefit of these insights will be novel and perhaps more sophisticated approaches to education and exhibitions. 

As a research network with relatively modest range of activities, there are limits to the claims that can be reasonably made for it. Nevertheless, the social potential of the visual arts in the context of violent conflict is truly considerable. They have a part to play in how conflicts are given visual expression, how traumatic memories are voiced and, perhaps, how they can be resolved.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30639</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Sound installation by Nikolaj Bendix Skyum Larsen, entitled 'Quicksand', premiered at the 'Promised Land' conference at Central Saint Martins on 3 December 2016.

The event was chaired by Dr Julian Stallabrass and featured artist and academic Coco Fusco, who was participating in the Network. She raised questions particularly with respect to gender in the context or war and how art enables new recognitions and insights, which were taken up at a later workshop.

Many of the people who attended asked to be part of the Art and Conflict network, a steadily growing database of now over 1k. They have all received a link to the free online publication, and are signed up for future newsletters.

How does the contemporary artist and critic reconcile and respond to today's realities? How can critical integrity be reclaimed and what is the potential for critics to contribute to a wider cultural intelligence?
7 speakers responded to these questions, with a short film produced that is shown on the AICA and other websites.

Approximately 40 people attended the first workshop, with presentations by invited speakers Hrair Sarkassian, a Syrian artist from Jordan, and Adela Jusic, an artist from Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina. The main content was a reflection on the role and purpose of art addressing conflict, or made in the context of conflict. 
75 people attended a second event, a full one day series of 8 lectures and presentations by Art and Conflict Network members and invited international speakers - curator and writer Sarah Rifky from Cairo, and curator Nat Muller, based in the Netherlands. The audience at this event was made up of academics from a range of disciplines and universities, funders, NGOs, artists and curators and undergraduate and postgraduate students. We set up a live link to Gaza with two theatre practitioners, which brought the realities of living amidst the Israel/Palestine conflict into the room. There was lively discussion at the workshop; audience participation was more limited at the second event because of such a full roster of speakers, but we invited and recorded feedback which was enthusiastic: principally people wanting more events, with various suggestions with respect to issues and questions, and potential possibilities as referenced in other parts of this report.

The direct impact of the work is the interest generated, as described above, and we are therefore pursuing particular lines of enquiry and possibility, talking to potential partners (for example the Imperial War Museum, Vivarta, Tate, Goldsmiths and SOAS) with respect to future activities, and writing new funding applications. 
I have been invited to speak at symposia organised by other institutes and approached by a number of organisations with respect to exploring potential joint ventures.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54590da979db97.35545326</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/events/artists-responses-conflict/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>50000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Support to the Performing and Visual Arts</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Stanley Thomas Johnson Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>4794</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>8F643860-AE2F-4E66-96B1-66B5A451A297</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deb8143b0749.67877284</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Research and activities addressing the role and value of art in the context of international context continue with new partnerships through events, an artwork, and an artist residency as reported elsewhere on this site.

The best way I can answer this question is to give some examples of feedback received as impacts in this area are invariably personal and diverse:
'I am really so happy that I could speak there at the workshop. For artists from the Balkans it is very important thing to be invited to for example London and present their work at places like your workshop. Thank you for the opportunity and please if you know anyone travelling to Bosnia and in need for anything, networking, place to stay etc, please let me know'. (Adela Jusic, artist from Sarajevo, who spoke at the first workshop.)
'Really interesting and refreshing to look at the work I do from a different perspective.' (Sarah Whyatt, previous director of PEN and independent human rights consultant)
'I have made great connections which have even led to a collaboration and other possibilities for the future.' (Theo Price, Cobra)
'Really inspiring, every speaker left me with an indelible impression. Since then, many ideas have taken seed in my mind.'
'This area is still very small, considering the geographical impact and breadth of war and conflict, so it was great to meet with everyone in the hope that it might expand.'
We have a file of many more comments. 
However it is early days and we will continue to measure the responses, especially from the publication.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E6CC77EB-6E87-4F5B-8503-EB638E320ABE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463ab22abec89.87988449</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) The principal aim of the work was to establish whether there would be significant interest in the role of art with respect to the subject of conflict, not just within the arts sector but from other disciplines and sectors. This proved undoubtedly to be the case. The feedback we received throughout is testimony to this, referenced in an independent evaluation (available on request) and described in my introduction to the online publication. We had waiting lists for the two events at the ICA and the RCA and ongoing requests for sustained activities. 
The generosity of artists and academics alike was extraordinary, with scarce financial incentive, if any. People gave so freely of their knowledge and were so open to working collaboratively to address the imperative to focus, across disciplines, on the challenges faced. The stretch of geographical, political, and social contexts that was covered kept the discourse relevant across what was a very broad constituency. Focus came through individual presentations. Throughout, it was marked how little people knew of each other's work, despite shared agendas and this points to a need for a significant amount of further interchange, across theory and practice. 
2) We came to the conclusion that the research warranted more than an article, and hence the production of an illustrated, 88-page, online publication, with 7 commissioned essays by curators, artists and academics. The reach of the Royal College of Art, Index on Censorship, Culture+Conflict, Goldsmiths', SOAS and other networks where the publication is or will shortly be available, provides a diversity of platforms for debate across Higher Education, NGOs and the arts sector. The content of the publication displays a scope of methodologies, suggestions, provocations, questions, and possibilities, and judging by comments received so far, feels a real achievement.
3) We are delighted that the discourse, the research, and the building of the network is directly leading to plans currently being developed by working closely with colleagues in a number of institutes including SOAS, Goldsmiths', the Imperial War Museum, the British Council and international arts organisations. 
4) I wildly underestimated the amount of time the organisation of the workshops would involve; nor did I anticipate the difficulty of obtaining visas for invited speakers, which became a real problem, but among many useful lessons learned for future activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our ambitions come directly from the Network's discussions of the past year, and we are currently working with a number of organisations (named above) to realise three main activities. 
Firstly, ongoing research into the role of art in the context of conflict including regular gatherings grouped around particular questions and contexts, leading to a major, international conference and related publication.
Secondly, we aim to relate theory to practice in the form of artists' 'residencies' to encourage conversations between people from conflicted communities, and UK based artists, curators and others wishing to explore the many exigencies that war generates, but who are distanced from the realities. For example, an artist from Afghanistan invited to the UK to explore the conflict archives and collections held by the Imperial War Museum, King's College and the National Army Museum, bringing fresh and alternative insights to our own understanding. 
Thirdly, the building of new databases that we know are much needed resources: profiles of artists for NGOs and others to access; and information on HE courses that address the intersection between art and conflict for prospective national and international students and academics.
We very much hope that the AHRC will be interested in considering further support.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>546AA455-83A4-45DB-B610-D98138BA9EB2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463a7504fedd2.10431104</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rca.ac.uk/art&amp;conflict</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We are steadily adding to the multi disciplinary database of individuals and organisations registering interest in the intersection between art and conflict.

We are building a database of artists working in the context of conflict, or whose work intersects with conflict as a subject, as a future resource for NGOs and others seeking artists' engagement - this is contingent on future funding for which we have applied.

An additional ambition is to build on what is the beginning of a database of HE courses in this subject area.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D3E20CAB-02F1-45A8-A26F-5C9D6F6C7252</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The database of people interested in art and conflict, now on Mailchimp, makes it very easy to communicate new activities.

These include the political and diplomatic community, NGOs, international development agencies, academia, the media, and the many peace-building initiatives worldwide. 
The work is based on the belief that the arts have a vital role to play, not least in their unique ability to communicate the powerful personal and political issues of conflict. We offer advice and in kind support to artists in conflict areas, connecting them and their work to international networks and platforms. We also broker connections between international agencies and organisations that operate development programmes in areas of conflict or post-conflict but are not engaged with the cultural community. Culture+Conflict organises events, discussions, seminars and artist presentations. Previous events have taken place at Amnesty International, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), the House of Lords, the Delfina Foundation, the Royal Court Theatre, the Imperial War Museum, the Free Word Centre, Southbank Centre, and the Royal College of Art.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E71930A0-BC64-4B4E-BBD0-BE6C159F5B40</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are participating in an increasing number of activities managed by other organisations.
