In the 'age of discoveries' knowledge and empire were inextricably linked. The success of Europe's overseas expansion rested on a massive investment in the knowledge and skills needed to navigate great oceans and tame unexplored territories. Map-making was central to success and as Britain moved ahead in the race for empire it also became the hub of an international knowledge network and a leading centre for the production and distribution of maps. The state, leading players in the scientific revolution, practical mariners, and craftsmen all contributed to this success. Despite the economic, scientific, and political importance of the trade, scholarly attention has focused on maps as artefacts of great beauty rather than looking at their broader role in the development in the knowledge economy which is the subject of this project.\n \nAims and objectives\nAlthough the precise research questions will be developed by the research student the aim of this project is to assess the impact of overseas expansion on the development of cartographic skills and the broader accumulation of useful knowledge. A sample of maps drawn largely from the National Maritime Museum's rich collection will be combined with other evidence to explain how maps were used in Britain's drive for empire between 1660 and 1720 and how it changed the market for cartographic skills. A detailed picture will be drawn of how the London map-making trade was organized and how the necessary knowledge networks functioning over great distances were constructed. It will also look at how the skills and tools necessary in map-making were developed and disseminated. An attempt will be made to assess the impact of better charts and maps on both the narrow goal of improving the safety and efficiency of navigation and the broader impact of the enhanced skills on the technological capabilities of the British economy and how they fed into the changes which culminated in Industrial Revolution. Overall, the project will enhance academic understanding and public knowledge of the map collections at the NMM and elsewhere by moving beyond seeing maps as mere artefacts and by reinserting them into history at large to show how changes in cartography was bound up with Britain's economic, social and political development in important and unsuspected ways.\n\nPotential applications and benefits\nThe project findings will be widely disseminated through conferences, seminars and high quality published research which will improve academic understanding and public awareness of the map collections at the NMM and elsewhere. It will also facilitate future research in a number of different areas (history of cartography and navigation, Atlantic studies, maritime London, British economic and social history, travel, exploration, and the history of science). The collaboration will allow the student to gain, not only the research and writing skills needed to produce a high quality thesis which will be publishable in due course, but also valuable curatorial experience through work at a national museum with the opportunity to design their own small-scale display in the micro-gallery. The project will complement work done at the Centre for the History of Maritime Science due to open in in 2011 and benefit the museum's exhibition, research, education, and on-line programmes through providing original and relevant material which will help put maps, measuring instruments, and other artefacts into their social and economic context and will feed directly into the existing 'Atlantic Worlds' gallery and the proposed 'Maritime London' gallery. The Museum's commitment to creative engagement with history means that this academic work has the potential to feed into programmes, exh</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal beneficiaries of the proposed project, besides the academic community, will be the partner organization, the National Maritime Museum, other museums with map and instrument collections, and their visiting public. A core aim of the NMM is to make its collections accessible and relevant to a wide range of audiences including school children and life-long learners as well as specialist researchers. The Museum looks forward to the research of the doctoral student providing original and relevant material which will help put maps, measuring instruments, and other artefacts into their social and economic context and highlight their role in long-run change and development. The student will be encouraged to suggest and curate a small-scale display in one of the micro galleries at the NMM and the work will feed directly into the existing 'Atlantic Worlds' and the 'Maritime London' gallery which is due to open in the autumn of 2013. The sudent will also be encouraged to collaborate with other museums, above all those in Scotland, in providing contextual information which will be used to enhance their displays.\n \nThe NMM has an active outreach programme and the results of this project will be disseminated not only through exhibitions but also conferences, seminars and lectures. The Museum also produces scholarly and general publications and digital media. Its work with schools and community groups will further ensure that the outcomes of the research will reach the broadest possible audience. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025204/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
