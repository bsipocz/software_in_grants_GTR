&lt;p>One factor that might account for poor language skills in this group is the way in which they process sounds. In this project, a series of experiments will examine the sound processing abilities of children with MMHL:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>To assess whether children with MMHL have deficits in processing sounds in the real world, performance will be assessed both while children are wearing their hearing aid(s), and while they are not. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To assess whether poor performance is due to the extra effort required for them to listen, sound processing will also be measured using a task that does not require any active listening.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To examine whether deficits in sound processing lead to language impairments in children with MMHL, performance on a wide range of language tests will be assessed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The results of this project will increase understanding about how deficits in sound processing might impact upon language development in children. Findings could be used by teachers, audiologists, and speech and language therapists to diagnose deficits in sound processing, and to develop interventions to overcome these.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>217651</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>[P3] Auditory maturation in children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>907AB0BB-222C-43DA-A4CF-F1714F34A65C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presentation - 2013 UCL Neuroscience Symposium.

The findings from this grant have implications for improving the health and well-being of children with mild to moderate hearing loss (MMHL). We have therefore ensured that our findings are disseminated to a variety of different audiences, both professional and public, in order to maximise impact. This has been done through a number of routes: 
1. Dissemination via conference attendance and journal publications Our findings have been presented at a number of conferences which are also attended by a range of clinicians (audiologists, Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs), Teachers of the Deaf, educational psychologists) and industry professionals (hearing aid companies). The results of this project were also publicised during invited seminars at two high-profile events - the British Society of Audiology's (BSA) Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) Satellite Training Day, and the BSA Paediatric Audiology Interest Group's 2014 conference. We currently have five papers in preparation to be submitted for publication in academic journals. At least three of these papers will be submitted to journals whose readership includes healthcare professionals, and all articles will be open access. 
2. Links with clinical professionals We have developed and maintained ongoing links with SLTs in Local Educational Authorities across London and the South East of England. We have also developed links with local audiology departments, including advising, and delivering talks about our work to the Nuffield Hearing and Speech Centre, Royal Free NHS Trust, and the Barking &amp;amp; Dagenham NHS Trust. The results of the project have been included by the PI as part of the programme of teaching delivered to SLT students at University College London. 
3. Public engagement A comprehensive project website has been in place since the start of the project (http://tinyurl.com/ucl-mmhl). Feedback about the project has been sent to families and schools in the form of a newsletter. Information about the study was also distributed to members of the public as part of the Noisy World exhibit at the Summer Science 2011 exhibition at the Royal Society. 

Economic impacts: 
The project directly contributed to the award of further funding which will further investigate the development of sound processing in children with MMHL and examine possible routes to remediation (FP7-607139; https://icareitn.eu/). This project forms part of a ?4,085,629 Initial Training Network funded by the EU. An integral part of this grant is the collaboration with partners from industry (e.g. hearing aid companies, software development companies) with a view to enhancing their research capacity. Policy and public services: Following the success of this grant, the PI has become involved in a collaboration with The National Sensory Impaired Partnership (NatSIP), funded by the Department for Education (DfE), to assess educational outcomes for children with hearing loss as linked to provision. It is anticipated that this project will have direct implications for policy for the provision of SLT services to children with hearing loss.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>80F834D2-1E9F-42A0-AC74-EA71640A07FB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5491934b137dd1.05641570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this project, 46 8-16 year-old children with mild to moderate hearing loss (MMHL) and 44 age-matched controls were assessed on a battery of tests that measured their sound processing and language skills. The aims of the project were to (1) assess the sound processing skills of children with MMHL using behavioural methods, both whilst they were wearing their hearing aids and whilst they were not; (2) assess the sound processing skills of children with MMHL using electrophysiological methods that are free from task demands, and (3) examine whether deficits in sound processing were associated with poorer language outcomes in children with MMHL. We found that, without hearing aids, children with MMHL performed significantly more poorly than their normally hearing peers on all of our behavioural measures of sound processing apart from two. Children with MMHL appeared to have particular difficulty on tasks assessing their ability to discriminate the frequency structure of sounds, and to track changes in frequency over time. However, their ability to track slow changes in the loudness of sounds (the so-called 'envelope') was unimpaired. For the children with MMHL who wore hearing aids, aided performance on the behavioural tasks was significantly improved on several of the tasks relative to unaided performance. However, the sound processing skills of children with MMHL remained poorer than those of controls for the majority of tasks, even when they were wearing their hearing aids. Our findings suggest that in addition to hearing sounds more quietly, children with MMHL are likely to experience differences in the way in which they hear sounds, even when they are wearing their hearing aids. We also examined sound processing using electrophysiological methods (electroencephology; EEG). These methods record the brain's automatic responses to sounds and are independent from 'higher-level' influences such as attention and fatigue. We compared the brain responses of children with MMHL to those of controls while they were listening to different sorts of sounds. Because we know that these brain responses change with age, we divided our groups into young (8-11 years) and old (12-16 years) subgroups. We found that overall, children with MMHL showed brain responses to the majority of sounds that were different from those of controls. However, this was typically true only for the older children with MMHL; the younger MMHL group showed brain responses that were similar to those of their normally hearing age-mates. Our findings suggest that the brain responses of children with MMHL to sound may develop differently to those of normally hearing children. We need to conduct further research to find out why this might be. Finally, we also examined whether deficits in sound processing were associated with poorer language outcomes in children with MMHL. We found that as a group, children with MMHL performed more poorly than controls on all of the language measures that we took. However, there were considerable individual differences, with many children with MMHL performing within normal limits on the language assessments. Importantly, we found that sound processing skills did predict language outcomes in children with MMHL. However, (a) many children with MMHL performed within normal limits on the language assessments despite showing deficits in sound processing, and (b) in addition to sound processing, lower nonverbal IQ and a family history of language difficulties were also associated with poorer language outcomes in this group. Together, our findings suggest that deficits in sound processing are not sufficient to cause language difficulties in children with MMHL. However, these deficits may act as risk factors, in conjunction with nonverbal IQ and genetic predisposition, in determining whether or not a child with MMHL will have problems with language.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic routes: In as much as our findings suggest that deficits in sound processing are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause disordered language development, the results of this project have implications for scientific theories that attribute developmental disorders of oral and written language (e.g. Specific Language Impairment and dyslexia) to deficits in sound processing. They also provide support for multiple risk factor theories of these disorders. Non-academic routes: Our work suggests that not all children with MMHL will go on to develop difficulties with oral or written language. This is information that clinicians can use to reassure parents whose children have been newly diagnosed with MMHL. Moreover, this research also highlights some additional risk factors which may be important for clinicians to consider in predicting prognosis and planning interventions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7BD4A347-82FA-4DD6-B93A-9B08523266FE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>549180b86dabf3.42062716</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/dev-sci/mmhl</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>127BCFDC-E500-4506-9035-17B5E140E5AA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of hearing aids on auditory processing in children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss: A behavioural study</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle> International Journal of Audiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c81448d274c097dce6170604c42cd3f5"><gtr:id>c81448d274c097dce6170604c42cd3f5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tuomainen, O.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464cbf7a3e893.33271393</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFA10653-7015-4A89-B8B4-897704B3DB6D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Language Development and Impairment in Children with Mild to Moderate Sensorineural Hearing Loss</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aad2292f71bf3e3331a675db60b33de3"><gtr:id>aad2292f71bf3e3331a675db60b33de3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Halliday LF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58c9c945c9fb77.78845900</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E469E8A-DC29-46B2-813D-5A254D85B9D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Maturation of auditory event-related potentials in children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Audiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c81448d274c097dce6170604c42cd3f5"><gtr:id>c81448d274c097dce6170604c42cd3f5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tuomainen, O.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464cd2edde077.39672373</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E7CD53C3-E867-424A-BDFF-4E56FEE137F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Auditory Processing Deficits Are Sometimes Necessary and Sometimes Sufficient for Language Difficulties in Children: Evidence from Mild to Moderate Sensorineural Hearing Loss</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aad2292f71bf3e3331a675db60b33de3"><gtr:id>aad2292f71bf3e3331a675db60b33de3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Halliday LF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58c9c9b37e2752.08691321</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H010815/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-061-25-0440</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
