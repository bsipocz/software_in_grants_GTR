The buried Neolithic landscape of Herm (Channel Islands)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/F010575/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Islands have sometimes been described as laboratories for the study of prehistoric societies. They owe this status in part to the frequent presence of an impressive number of visible remains, be they temples (Malta), statues (Easter Island) or tombs (Orkney). The task facing the prehistoric archaeologist is to evaluate how far these impressive remains are the result of exceptional preservation in marginal locations, and how far the very nature of islands has had a major impact in moulding patterns of behaviour different from those of adjacent mainlands.\n\nLike Orkney, certain parts of the Channel Islands are renowned for the number of surviving or recorded Neolithic monuments, but in general these are difficult to situate in social terms owing to the absence of corresponding setllement or landscape evidence. An almost unique exception is provided by the northern end of Herm, where an impressive number of tombs fringes a lowland sandy plain. The post-prehistoric sand cover, which measures over a metre in depth, has preserved buried soils (visible in certain exposures), and in particular has protected the land surface on which the megalithic monuments were built. The recorded monuments lie mainly around the edges of the sandy plain, where the sand cover is thin, and further unrecorded monuments probably lie within the plain itself, where only a handful are currently known.\n\nThe objective of this project is to examine the land surface buried beneath the sand, using geophysics and test-pitting to map it and to locate settlement activity (in terms of structures and artefacts) and unrecorded monuments. The latter are primarily funerary in nature and the study will enable us to assess whether burial or ceremonial practices were performed within the same areas as everyday settlement, farming and stock-keeping, or whether these activiites were segregated. This is a key question for the proper understanding of prehistoric societies throughout western Europe, but it is very rare to have lowland landscapes that have been preserved from recent agricultural damage. It will enable us to determine whether a case can be made for Herm having been an 'island of the dead' during the Neolithic period, by analogy with islands off the coast of Brittany (and even Scotland) where such claims have recently been made.\n\nThe island character of Herm is the crucial background to this enquiry, but the insularity of the Guernsey archipelago (comprising the islands of Guernsey, Herm, Jethou and Sark) was not a static given at this period but was undergoing processes of radical transformation as sea-level rose rapidly. When the first farmers established themselves (c.5000 BC) several of the present-day islands were still joined to each other, and much of the earlier Neolithic land surface has been lost beneath the sea. The drowned landscape is represented today by the extensive offshore skerries (rocky islets) around Herm, many of which appear and disappear with the daily tidal cycle. Modelling the changing topography of the island during early- and mid-Holocene sea-level rise will be an integral part of this project.\n\nThough speculative in some respects - we cannot know what lies beneath the sand or the coastal shallows until we have looked - the potential for radical new insights is considerable. We hope to discover well-preserved Neolithic settlements dating back to the initial phase of farming colonisation, and there is a strong likelihood of well-preserved but hitherto unrecorded megalithic monuments beneath the sand. The research potential of a preserved Neolithic land surface in this symbolically charged island setting is exceptional.\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>134991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has successfully answered the key research question: was Herm an 'island of the dead' during the Neolithic period. The evidence for cultivation (ard marks and soil improvement) coupled with slighter evidence for occupation sites suggests that the landscape around the megalithic monuments was worked on and lived in, not reserved for burial and ceremonial. In coming to this conclusion the issue of the relatively coarse chronology must be admitted - tombs and other traces may not be strictly contemporary - but dating evidence suggests settlement and cultivation from the mid 5th to the mid 2nd millennium, spanning the whole of the period when the tombs are likely to have been built and used. 

These results have a number of implications: 

a) archaeology 1: they suggest that even where high densities of funerary monuments are present, they do not necessarily constitute reserved sacred landscapes: this conclusion applies to other islands and island groups with high monuments densities (Arran, Scilly, Mol&amp;egrave;ne), and informs general models of Neolithic funerary behaviour (burial within and around the landscape of the living) 

b) archaeology 2: they confirm the potential of sand-covered landscapes for the investigation of prehistoric settlement and burial practices, especially insofar as luminescence dating provides a mechanism for chronological resolution; 

c) chronometry: despite the poorer precision of luminescence dating in comparison with AMS dating, systematic application of luminescence dating to stratified sequences can provide robust chronologies in contexts where organic materials for AMS dating are not available 

d) palaeoclimatology: the luminescence dating of the aeolian sand has identified a series of discrete periods of deposition (during recent centuries) which add to the growing literature on historical patterns of storminess. In comparison with other studies of this kind our work was unusual in the intensity of the investigation, allowing the mapping at a detailed scale of aeolian sand formations across an area of approximately 0.5 x 0.5 km. This has revealed the high degree of spatial and chronological variability in sand deposition and movement across a restricted area. 

e) palaeogeography: evidence from boreholes and excavations for the changing size and shape of the northern end of Herm - notably the existence of deep marine inlets - indicates the inadequacy of prehistoric shoreline reconstructions modelled simply from submarine contours. Direct investigation is essential in soft sediment contexts to establish the nature and position of prehistoric shorelines.

The successful large-scale application of luminescence dating to buried soils and to overlying sands has provided a detailed chronology of sand-blow events, restricted to short periods of time (late-2nd millennium BC, 13th/14th century AD, 17th century AD) that must relate to weather patterns and climate. The chronological patterning is consistent in its later part with anecdotal historical records. The potential of luminescence dating applied to aeolian sand for providing a chronologically detailed proxy of fluctuating storminess was an unexpected outcome of this project.

A preliminary report of the archaeological aspects of the work has been published in Journal of Field Archaeology (February 2013); and a paper on the luminescence dating has been published in Journal of Archaeological Science (2014).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The fieldwork on Herm was carried out with the support of the local community. This includes both the managers of Herm island (which is privately leased from the Crown via the States of Guernsey), and volunteers from Guernsey who took part in the project. Five Guernsey volunteers were regular participants in the fieldwork in all three years. 

Local interest in the project was demonstrated by media coverage: Channel TV evening news coverage (2008 &amp;amp; 2009), BBC local evening news coverage (2009 &amp;amp; 2010), BBC local radio news coverage (2008 &amp;amp; 2009), Guernsey Press coverage (2008, 2009 &amp;amp; 2010). 

A preliminary public lecture about the project was given at the Guernsey Museum in September 2008; and a public conference was held at the Guernsey Museum in May 2011 where the project team presented their results to the local community. The programme included a field visit to Herm.

The results from the fieldwork will be incorporated in a series of information boards that are being installed by the island managers to create an archaeological trail on Herm.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD0710EF-CAE8-4CC8-94D8-0233D14B576D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-567752467.99714167758f2d4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.dur.ac.uk/herm.project/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Remote sensing data (to be deposited with Archaeology Data Service at York)</gtr:description><gtr:id>872CCD3E-9B59-4B3A-A1B7-796D372F6A76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Remote sensing data to be combined with DTM and deposited with ADS at York after planned 2015 field season.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7994528150.18084666d70f62</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Remote sensing data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Excavation records and soil analyses (to be deposited with Archaeology Data Service at York)</gtr:description><gtr:id>DAE38D45-62EF-4C42-B3AB-B83986332397</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Excavation records and soil analyses to be deposited after fieldwork planned for 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5741471141.33599366d72c40</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Excavation records and soil analyses</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Digital Terrain Model of the buried land surface (to be deposited with Archaeology Data Service at York)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F0398CB-0270-4D5E-ACB8-9DEA9A936FEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DTM is currently under development pending further fieldwork planned for 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5689936518.3803666d74068</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Digital Terrain Model of the buried land surface</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B3D7BAD1-5C60-474E-8901-7D35B73F49C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Application of luminescence dating and geomorphological analysis to the study of landscape evolution, settlement and climate change on the Channel Island of Herm</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Archaeological Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f600403b5987fcb4d1e7d8498fd46cf4"><gtr:id>f600403b5987fcb4d1e7d8498fd46cf4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bailiff I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54479a67c13523.79051255</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F010575/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Prehistoric Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
