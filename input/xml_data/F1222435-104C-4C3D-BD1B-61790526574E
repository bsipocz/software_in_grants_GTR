Drawing on interviews with producers, commissioners and buyers combined with observations in a range of production environments, the research seeks to articulate and establish the complex internal and external factors that determine preschool production. It will show how key players manage/creatively negotiate these wider commercial, regulatory, cultural and technological forces and the implications for content.\n\nThis research is timely in view of the UK's recent international successes in preschool and the emergence of domestic (CBeebies) and internationally branded preschool channels (Nick Jr, Playhouse Disney). Government and industry reports regularly identify preschool TV as an important contributor to exports, and international success has foregrounded the growth of key players (Chorion, Entertainment Rights, HIT Entertainment) who generate substantial revenues from programme-related products. Yet the project's timing also coincides with a perceived crisis in children's TV following a ban on advertising for HFSS (high fat sugar salt) foods around programming targeted at children, and the reduced commitment of ITV to commissioning content and transmitting children's shows on its terrestrial service ITV 1. This contrast between international success and domestic crisis provides a compelling rationale for further investigation. \n\nHowever, although preschool TV has been identified as a fruitful source of inquiry, there has been no recent analysis of UK preschool TV and the practices and forces that shape its development, in contrast to work on children's TV generally and substantial effects literature. Within the broader setting of cultural production this research asks the following:\n- How, why and to what extent has the production ecology of preschool TV changed since the mid-1990s?\n- What range of forces shape and affect the organisation and production of preschool TV?\n- How do programme-makers and those involved in the commissioning/acquisition of preschool content manage/creatively negotiate the wider commercial, cultural, regulatory and technological forces that affect production?\n- How does this combination of external forces and internal strategies impact the nature of what is produced?\n\nTo meet the project's aims the research will satisfy the following objectives:\n- A contextualisation of preschool tv with reference to its history, structure, institutional relationships, working operations, professional practices and place within a changing international market \n- The identification of trends in respect of policy, content, commissioning, scheduling, channel provision, and organisational change. \n- An overview, identification and assessment of key players and their strategies including broadcasters, satellite channels, production companies and international partners. \n- An overview of export and ancillary markets (DVD, consumer products) and their impact on production strategies. \n- An analysis of programme samples produced and broadcast since 1995 to understand how changes in ecology are reflected in programme content\n- An assessment of the future of preschool in view of technological change and the emergence of new media platforms. \n\nBy placing the changing relationships and dependencies that constitute the changing production ecology at the heart of the analysis, the research contributes to a more rounded picture of preschool TV. The publication of the monograph Little Kids TV: The Changing Production Ecology of preschool TV for Palgrave Macmillan will benefit those within academia and the production community who wish to better understand how preschool concepts are generated, adapted, produced and exploited to meet a complex set of market and cultural priorities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27553</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog Post Kidsscreen 21 January 2009</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18A56F14-501C-4930-97AC-BAAB7B1270E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Josh Selig - President of Little Airplane Productions invited me to contribute two posts to his 'Planet Preschool Blog' on the Kidscreen website on January 21 2009 (http://kidscreen.com/2009/01/21/the-steemers-lecture-part-one/) and January 27 2009 (http://kidscreen.com/2009/01/27/).

The number of pan-Arab children's TV channels has expanded rapidly since the mid-1990s, serving countries where the proportion of under-18s is almost 50 percent of the total population. With this market growth some broadcasters like Al-Jazeera Children's Channel (JCC) and its preschool outlet Baraem, are actively supporting homegrown production as well as production partnerships with non-Arab programme-makers such as 3Line Media Ceidiog Creations, Chocolate Moose Media, Rival Media and Zodiak. This panel discussed how producers can successfully collaborate with Arab partners to produce quality children's content in the region. It provided insight into the type of content made for the region by Arab, British and non-British programme-makers right now. It explored the cultural and business factors that affect the process of production and content, and examined the type of programming that works for this market including reality, entertainment, information and preschool shows. How do you secure collaboration? What is the best way of working with local programme makers and writers, and how do you go about this? What is to be gained from these initiatives? And what is the best route for building lasting relationships where all parties benefit in a region that is undergoing immense political upheaval and change?

The book is timely in view of Britain's international successes in preschool and the emergence of domestic (CBeebies) and internationally branded preschool blocks and channels (Nick Jr, Playhouse Disney). It is also important for placing British achievements in preschool production against US practices, where there is much greater focus on integrating educational content, but traditionally less emphasis on regulatory interventions to secure the public interest in children's programming.

preschool TV and the practices and forces that shape its development, in contrast to work on children's TV generally and a substantial literature on effects. Within the broader setting of cultural production this research and the resulting book has tackled the following questions:
- How, why and to what extent has the production ecology of preschool TV changed since the mid-1990s?
- What range of forces shape and affect the organisation and production of preschool TV?
- How do programme-makers and those involved in the commissioning/acquisition of preschool content manage and creatively negotiate the wider commercial, cultural, regulatory and technological forces that affect production?
- How does this combination of external forces and internal strategies impact the nature of what is produced?
To meet the project's aims the research satisfied the following objectives:
- A contextualisation of preschool television with reference to its history, structure, institutional relationships, working operations, professional practices and place within a changing international market. Particular emphasis was placed on comparing production cultures in Britain and the US, two key sources of preschool programming.
- The identification of trends in respect of policy, content, commissioning, scheduling, channel provision, and organisational change. Particular emphasis was placed on the perceived crisis in children's television funding.
- An overview, identification and assessment of key players and their strategies including broadcasters (e.g Nick Jr, CBeebies, Five) and production companies (e.g. HIT Entertainment, Chorion).
- An overview of export and ancillary markets (DVD, consumer products) and their impact on production strategies.
- An analysis of programme samples produced and broadcast since 1995 to understand how changes in ecology are reflected in programme content
- An assessment of the future of preschool in view of technological change and the emergence of new media platforms.
By placing the changing relationships and dependencies that constitute the changing production ecology at the heart of the analysis, the resulting book contributes to a more rounded picture of preschool TV in both its domestic and international contexts.

AIMS
1.To complete the main outcome of the AHRC-funded research project,'The Production Ecology of Preschool Television in Britain'(ID 119149). This is a book 'Creating Preschool Television'(Previously 'Little Kids TV')for Palgrave Macmillan. This was delivered in July 2009.
2.Dissemination of Findings
Alongside the book, targets have been exceeded with 3 book chapters, 3 articles, blog contributions and conference presentations. Major highlights included my inaugural lecture in December 2008 and a conference presentation at RIPE 2008 in November 2008 in Germany, which provided an opportunity to present the research to industry practitioners as well as academic colleagues.
OBJECTIVES
1.To provide a contextualization of UK preschool TV with reference to its history, structure, working operations,

?
professional practices and place within a changing global marketplace.
The history of preschool TV was mapped out from secondary sources including the trade press, academic and practitioner accounts. With very little written about the working operations, professional practices and international performance of British preschool TV, the project relied largely on 88 interviews and observation evidence combined with theoretical analysis of production cultures and global markets. In the book these findings have been outlined in:
Ch. 1 Understanding Preschool Television as a Production ecology
Ch. 2 Safe at Home: The Origins of Preschool Television as a Public Service Project. Ch. 3 Growing Up: The Rise of the Global Market in Preschool Programming
Ch. 4 Broadcaster Perspectives on Preschool Production
2.The identification of significant trends in respect of policy, content, scheduling, channel provision and organisational change.
Policy trends were identified through policy analysis, through observation of industry debates as well as interviews with Ofcom and advocacy group ((Save Kids TV) representatives. Channel provision and scheduling practices were pinpointed with schedule analysis, together with observations of channel branding practices as well as interviews. Selected programmes were analysed with regard to aesthetic value, assumptions about the audience, and the extent to which programming aligned with commercial/educational considerations. In the book these findings have been outlined in:
Ch.4 Broadcaster Perspectives on Preschool Production
Ch6 Production Preliminaries - Development and Research
Ch 7 Production Checklists, Rules and Assumptions
Ch 8 In Production
Ch 10 Policy Interventions and the Crisis in Children's Television
3.An overview and identification of key players in the marketplace.
Profiles of broadcasters, distributors and producers based on interviews, company reports and trade press sources were compiled for Ch.4 (Broadcaster Perspectives on Preschool Production) and Ch.5 (Players in Rights Management and Production).
4.An overview of key export and ancillary markets (home entertainment, consumer products) and their impact on production strategies. In the book these findings have been outlined in:
Ch.9 Spinning off Profits: Ancillary Exploitation and the Power of Retail
Ch.3 Growing Up: The Rise of the Global Market in Preschool Programming.
5.An analysis of selected programmes produced and broadcast since 1995. This was achieved through textual analysis and interviews.Findings are outlined in chapters dealing specifically with production practices (Chs.6,7 &amp;amp; 8 - see above) as well as Ch.11 (The Bigger Picture: Preschool Children's TV in its Critical and Aesthetic contexts).
6.An assessment of the future of preschool TV in view of technological change. This is reflected throughout the book based on documentary and interview evidence and also in Ch.12 (Future Outlook). The impact of multiplatform developments in the preschool market is also addressed in a chapter for the edited volume 'Television and Digital Media'(eds. J. Bennett &amp;amp; N. Strange).

An additional achievement was the further investigation of policy developments on children's television in general, which went beyond the focus on preschool television. This research has been inspired by ongoing developments in British children's television which have provoked a crisis in provision and funding. This opened up further investigations into how this 'crisis' was dealt with in other countries. The fruits of this work are reflected in two book chapters.
'Public Service Media and Children: Serving the Digital Citizens of the Future' (Authored by J. Steemers and A. D'Arma) for the edited collection 'Reinventing Public Service Communication: European Broadcasting and Beyond' (editor Petros Iosifides) for Palgrave Macmillan.
'Serving Children in Public Service Media' (Authored by A. D'Arma, G. Enli and J. Steemers) for the edited collection 'The Public in Public Service media' (editors Greg Lowe and Gregor Daschmann) for Nordicom.

The project is important in advancing knowledge and understanding in the subject area, because it provides a comprehensive overview of British preschool TV, something which has never been done before. While there is a long- standing and rich seam of research devoted to the impact of tv on young children, especially in terms of cognitive development and educational achievement, we know rather less about the professionals behind these productions or how the institutional and economic context of children's tv affects the nature of what is made. We do know a great deal about the production of some preschool programmes. For example the history and development of 'Sesame Street' in the US has been widely documented since the late 1960s, because when it began it was almost unique in integrating educational content and research into production in ways that could be tested. Similarly more recent productions like 'Blue's Clues' have attracted attention because they incorporate new ways of addressing children and enhancing learning. Yet we know much less about the production circumstances, and motivations behind many other preschool shows, which are not so educationally-driven. We also know little about the assumptions that those who produce, broadcast and market preschool TV make about their audiences and the marketplace in which they operate. This is particularly the case for British shows, which unlike 'Sesame Street', have been driven less by pedagogical goals as by a desire to entertain children or simply to generate revenues for a series' investors. This research adds to the small number of UK preschool TV case studies in edited volumes.
In terms of advancing knowledge and understanding the project findings are significant for the following reasons:
1. Through the concept of production ecology it provides an analytical framework to examine preschool tv production, and explain how different actors co-exist, cooperate and compete within the production community.
2. Through the mapping of the different relationships between broadcasters, co-funders, different types of producers, product licensees, retailers and co-producers, it lays bare the extent of co-dependency, competition and collaboration, and the ways and extent to which the diverging or converging motivations of different players impact the range and diversity of preschool originations through a process of negotiation.
3. Building on previous historical and production research it charts the transition of British and US preschool tv into a more commercially-oriented enterprise, which is increasingly dependent on international and ancillary exploitation.
4. Based on extensive interviews and observations, it reveals how production is influenced by a range of internal pressures and external forces - including pressures to align productions with licensed merchandise and international markets, the impact of policy decisions (advertising bans, regulation), and the emergence of new media platforms.
This research therefore fills a gap, because it enhances our understanding of preschool tv, by revealing how it is originated, created and marketed by a diverse production community motivated by different goals and priorities. Beyond preschool tv however, the research opens up some interesting questions about the broader institutional settings of production and the tensions that exist between creativity and commerce, between artistry and industry, between organisational constraints and an individual's creative autonomy.
By placing the relationships and dependencies that constitute the production ecology at the heart of the analysis, the research contributes to a more rounded picture of Britain's place within the global preschool media market. In particular, the research will be useful to those who wish to understand better how preschool concepts are generated, adapted, produced and exploited to meet a a complex set of market demands and priorities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can be used by others in the policy sector and in industry to provide greater understanding of the children's production sector</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4241625C-F1F7-4656-9C29-17340C59E846</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5456b2914a3f23.61523852</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Witness at House of Lords Select Committee on Communications Inquiry on &amp;quot;BBC Charter Renewal: Public Purposes and License Fee' 27 October 2015.
