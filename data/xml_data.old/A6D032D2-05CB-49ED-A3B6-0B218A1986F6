For example, fundamental studies ofthe building blocks of matter are carried out with huge accelerators at institutions such as CERN. On a smaller scale,synchrotrons use accelerated electron beams to create light which is widely tunable from the infra-red to x-rays.The conventional accelerators used in these machines employ radio-frequency electric fields to accelerate chargedparticles. However, the maximum electric field that can be used is limited by electrical breakdown in the beam pipes, sothat accelerating particles to high energies requires a very long accelerator (the largest machine at CERN is 27 km incircumference!).Laser-driven plasma accelerators offer a way to make particle accelerators much more compact. In these devices anintense laser pulse propagates through an ionized gas (a plasma). As it does so, the laser pulse pushes the electronsaway from it and sets up a plasma wave which follows behind the laser pulse; this behaviour is directly analogous to thewater wake which trails a boat crossing a lake. In the case of a plasma wave, at the peaks of the wave there are moreelectrons than average, and at the troughs there are fewer. As a result of this charge separation, a very large electric fieldforms between the peaks and troughs of the plasma wave. This field can be about 1000 times larger than the maximumelectric field used in conventional accelerators, which means that a plasma accelerator can be 1000 times shorter than aconventional one and still produce particles of the same energy.This idea for making compact accelerators was first proposed over 25 years ago, but until recently the energies theycould reach were relatively low. The primary reason for this is that the driving laser pulse naturally defocuses as itpropagates through the plasma, reducing its intensity to the extent that acceleration ceases after only a few millimetres.Over the last few years our group has developed a new technique for channelling the intense laser pulses over longdistances. This technique involves forming a so-called plasma waveguide by firing an electrical discharge through anarrow, gas-filled capillary. The plasma formed in this way has a lower density on axis, which acts to continually refocusthe laser radiation and so prevent it from defocusing. The plasma waveguide is therefore similar to an optical fibre.Very recently we used this channelling technique to extend the length of laser-driven plasma accelerators by more than afactor of 10, and so increase the energy of the accelerated electrons to a billion electron volts - that is, the energy anelectron would gain if it were accelerated by two plates with a billion volts between them. This electron energy is about thesame as used in conventional synchrotrons - but the plasma accelerator is only 33 mm long, compared the tens of metresrequired for a conventional accelerator.The present programme of research aims to build on these advances and develop techniques for increasing the energy ofthe accelerated electrons and providing more control of the acceleration process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>127217</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Results obtained during this research programme are currently informing the EuPRAXIA project, which is a five-year project funded by the European Union to first produce a conceptual design report for the world's first high-energy plasma-based accelerator with industrial beam quality and user areas. Our findings therefore contribute directly to UK competitiveness in this emerging area. The successful demonstration of compact plasma accelerators would have a significant impact in the fundamental and applied sciences, as well as in medicine and engineering. As such this work will bring long term societal and economic impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>510CCE05-5061-4A71-875F-F085B0A3CF32</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd4c5f027742.27256084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>When an intense laser pulse propagates through a plasma (an ionized gas) the electrons in the plasma are pushed away from the front and back of the laser pulse to form a trailing plasma wave in much the same way that a moving boat creates a water wake. The electric fields in the plasma wave can be more than a thousand times larger than those used in conventional accelerators such as the LHC at CERN. Particles injected into the correct phase of the plasma wave can therefore be accelerated to energies of order 1 GeV in only a few tens of millimetres.

This research grant supported the work of a graduate student. The student investigated a way of increasing the energy gained by electrons in a plasma accelerator by using plasmas in which the density increased along the axis of the laser propagation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>If successful, this approach would immediately enable very compact sources of X-rays - either from the plasma accelerator itself, or via an external magnetic undulator. As techniques to control plasma accelerators are developed it can be expected that they could drive extremely compact free-electron lasers coherent (i.e. &amp;quot;laser-like&amp;quot;) radiation at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths and, eventually, in the X-ray range. On a longer timescale, MP-LWFAs may provide efficient, high-repetition rate accelerator stages for compact particle colliders.

Plasma accelerators would be sufficiently compact and cheap for use in university, hospital or industrial laboratories. Bringing into these labs research which is today restricted to national or international facilities would greatly increase the access to ultrafast imaging and probing techniques --- there is little doubt that success in this area could revolutionize work in many areas of the medical, biological and physical sciences. This in turn would benefit society through increased understanding of important chemical and biological processes and by better medical diagnostics. For example, new imaging methods have emerged at synchrotrons that enable much earlier diagnosis of serious diseases such as cancer, where earlier diagnosis translates directly into saving lives. There is in addition the possibility of using this technology to improve treatments by, for example, micro-beam radiation therapy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>02B5FF8F-9134-41B2-9BD5-DB356FF3EA12</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd4cff0f7411.41387040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0BAB344-7FF3-4566-BF15-C0FC84260DB3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Laser wakefield acceleration in tapered plasma channels : theory, simulation and experiment</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d5488250ea90bac2b0e3f743b3e272ac"><gtr:id>d5488250ea90bac2b0e3f743b3e272ac</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rittershofer Wolf</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d9d4ef81cc22.29903230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF5ACEEC-E124-4668-BBC0-8FFCCA8F60CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transverse beam profile measurements of laser accelerated electrons using coherent optical radiation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/099a3a180234c753fe97e11c4060e067"><gtr:id>099a3a180234c753fe97e11c4060e067</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bourgeois N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d038038bb7b08e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0EC90571-7E83-42B0-A3DA-7EE858EBF496</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigation of GeV-scale electron acceleration in a gas-filled capillary discharge waveguide</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Journal of Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0978f73197f2cc650a9a3faf5e77e0e1"><gtr:id>0978f73197f2cc650a9a3faf5e77e0e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Walker P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54591f11928935.14928625</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FA5069EC-2A9D-4B0E-B671-97430D229A3F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electron acceleration driven in plasma channels at the Astra-Gemini laser facility</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0978f73197f2cc650a9a3faf5e77e0e1"><gtr:id>0978f73197f2cc650a9a3faf5e77e0e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Walker P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cf26ccafa9d7.17491497</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G067791/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>8C42F55F-1A1F-4ACE-B264-F6697518680A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plasma physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A153F61-85B9-466B-AC56-9B187EFF9AD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plasmas - Laser &amp; Fusion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
