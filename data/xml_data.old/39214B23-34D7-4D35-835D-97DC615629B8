Offering new models for financial transactions, based on trust, and maintained through its open transactional database, currencies such as Bitcoin challenge the government-regulated fiat currencies that we currently use today. 

However, users of cryptocurrencies are beginning to realise that it is the underlying technology of the blockchain that is likely to have the most profound effect on how we understand money. The blockchain is an global open ledger that records and verifies transactions, whilst encrypting the identity of users changes entirely how value is accounted for. No longer are banks or governments the mediators of currencies, with the power to divest or invest to dictate the flow of value within society, the blockchain decentralises money and offers a platform for its creative use. Presenting money as code, users of the blockchain are starting to explore new opportunities for how values can be represented, as technologies such as the blockchain change the representation of value. 

This project will introduce the underlying principles of the blockchain to audiences that would otherwise not be consulted on the development of new currencies. Using a design-led and participatory approach, the research project will explore potential use cases for money as software through involvement with families, small businesses and local civic services. The research represents a significant contribution to contemporary debates around the emergence of new forms of value exchange and offers tangible outcomes for local, economic and academic communities.

This 18 month project addresses directly the ESRC priority area: 'Economic performance and sustainable growth'. The innovative design of this research project, its relationship with actual high street environments and involvement of the New Economic Foundation and the Royal Bank of Scotland constitutes transformative research at the high risk, high reward end of the research spectrum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's pathways to impact follow three routes. The first is through the active involvement of individuals, groups, customers and organisations in a participatory design process involving contextual understanding, design and development and evaluation. The second is through public, developer and policy maker engagement activities to reach a wide audience of end users, including an Expert Working Group (EWG) and workshops that provide access to project prototypes. The third is through an engagement with the press (National and International). The impacts envisaged are instrumental, in the form of financial services designed by families or small companies to support their management and exchange of money, and conceptual, through reframing debates on reciprocity as enabled by the affordances of programmable money. We will engage as appropriate with the Urban Transformations Co-ordinator and other relevant projects funded by the ESRC and RCUK to exploit potential synergies across projects. 

Throughout the events, activities and outputs, impact will be captured in a number of ways including: number of people engaged in events, evaluation from events including testimonial feedback, indication that government have adopted ideas from the research, documentation of press. 

Beneficiaries include existing customers and members of the community who live close by and/or use the Forrest Road branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank employees and the Technology Services team of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the New Economics Foundation, and the local technology start-up community. The Edinburgh start-up community is highly active across the use of crypto-currencies and the research team have good relations with Codebase who is the UK's largest growing tech incubator with companies such as Kotikan, RelayMed, Rightscale, Cloudsoft and Float as tenants.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>KASH cups is an interactive system of coffee cups, which reveals new opportunities for

Things2Things was a one-year-long project of the 3TU Industrial Design programs in the Netherlands that ran from January to October 2016. The project brought together a community of almost 50 professional designers and design researchers to explore the role of design thinking in creativity and innovation within the field of the Internet of Things. We have captured the key insights generated during the workshops in a booklet that we are launching at the Dutch Design Week, DRIVE Festival for Design and Innovation. 

Anticipating a culture of small scale, distributed manufacturing, the workshop envisions a scenario in which people receive not software suggestions, but material artifacts that anticipate their daily needs. Over a period of 3 months, three families will play host to three networked 3D printers that 'print' artifacts meant to aid families in their daily practices. During the 3 months, participants in the final workshop will use readings from families' calendars in order to design objects for the families, which will then be sent over the Internet to the 3D printers. During the workshop, participants will discuss, evaluate and create new design concepts in light of the diaries families are asked to maintain about their experiences with these unusual material artifacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e70b283dc6.90473275</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://things2things.nl/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Value Chains and Constellations exhibition of Product Designers at the Royal Bank of Scotland, Gogarburn</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6164954-89B8-4B7A-833D-8A0D344C291B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Value Chains and Constellations exhibition of Product Designers at the Royal Bank of Scotland, Gogarburn presented work by students that responded to the problems and opportunities of PSD2 and Blockchain technologies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e925bba6c0.88063350</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ThingsCon workshop and demo (Amsterdam, Netherlands)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>10955AD6-7FA5-45EC-82D7-2463647F6A2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Firstly, 30-40 people participated in a blockexchange workshop to develop a better understanding of blockchain technology and spark discussion of new use case ideas.

Within STiPS the aim is to explore the particular challenges of developing systems for secure, low-friction, transactions in public spaces. In this workshop we are interested in exploring not only in the exchange of monetary currency, but also in the concept of trading data and personal information, where the line between data and currency blurs, and data becomes currency. As well as the explicit exchanges taking place between people, we are also interested in the trading and transfer of data taking place between devices and systems, of which people are generally unaware, but which forms part of this complex web of data transactions.
 
In the STiPS project so far we have begun to map out the practices and transactions currently taking place in a series of ethnographic studies, and have explored reactions to the BitBarista a hacked coffee machine that sells coffee for Bitcoin. We are looking to move into adopting technology developed at the RBS that may support new data transaction systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a2f53b26d823.97957002</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Demonstration of Block Exchange principles at Talbot Rice Gallery / Playtime event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3860315B-2E79-43D7-AF95-42DBDB892DEE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talbot Rice Gallery was a special one-day exhibition showcasing the results of an innovative hands-on workshop. Guided by artist Rob Kennedy and curator James Clegg, delegates were welcomed to drop-in and contribute verbally and physically to a playful discussion about how modes of exhibition and display shape and manifest cultural, social, political and physical engagements within life.

Playtime tests the fundamental process of exhibition making by looking at how the manipulation of simple objects and basic materials can allow complex ideas to be shared in imaginative and accessible ways. Starting with an empty space and pile of cardboard boxes, the workshop will have seen a diverse group of academics and students challenged to play out and debate a number of games, applying the logic of a particular world-view to the subsequent spatial creations you will find presented in the Gallery.

Led by specialist 'game leaders' the project will provide insights into ongoing research from across the University and further afield. From animal behaviour to invisibility, from translation to tool-making, from cyborgs to lateral thinking, Playtime will overcome disciplinary boundaries and foster curiosity, fantasy and imagination. The content of the exhibition will only become known through its making, this process will reflect and encourage new forms of creative learning and interaction.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e3a4916d96.58868028</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/talbot-rice/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/rob-kennedy-acts-of-dis-play/playtime</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>At this point in the project we have engaged in a wide variety of public, professional and cultural events to support the understanding that money is changing its form.

Key to the impact has been the Block Exchange workshop that helps people ideate through distributed ledger technologies:
http://blockexchange.designinformatics.org

and the software platform GeoCoin that further allows people to perform and design smart contracts in the rural and urban contexts:
https://geocoin.site

Both of these engagement platforms have supported numerous parties to understand and develop their own interpretation of the technology and it's implications. Details of engagement events are lists in this submission.

It could be argued that not everyone needs to know how blockchain or mining works in order to use Bitcoin or similar currencies, and to an extent this is true (consider the analogy of driving a car versus the knowledge of a mechanic). However, for the design communities to be able to design platforms and services that harness the power of a peer-to-peer validated blockchain, understanding the underlying principles is essential in order to enable critical mass adoption levels.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>979D90F2-2D00-4139-AB7E-B835B44C8BE6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca5132c35da2.74591025</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Money in it's current form could be considered as hiding or skewing value and is inherently entangled with concepts of value(s) beyond its economic worth. Value comes in different forms and dimensions, and is created or attached to things by organisations, markets or people. Through our research to date we consider how recent debates in Human-Currency Interactions should be expanded to include people's more complex value practices for which money is only one representation of within a person's wider value constellation. 

The perspective of isolated instances of monetary value exchanges need to be replaced with a more embedded perspective as part of a more abstract constellation of values across which exchanges take place, as 'Human-Value-Interactions'. This is, we believe, an important shift away from the purely economic towards social and personal models of value exchange in the digital sharing economy.

Given our insights into the affective and performative aspects of currency, and the rich 'strings' of socially and personally embedded interpretations of value, we believe a shift towards more personalised, modular or adjustable systems integrating the complex network of complimentary currencies would allow users to negotiate this increasingly complex ecosystem of money and value(s). To summarise, our research proposes three design opportunities to design for (a) evolving monetary practices, (b) integrated complimentary currencies, and (c) for entangled idiosyncratic value practices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We propose that peoples practice with money is changing as money begins to is change its form. As such, we believe that novel developments of smart contracts and cryptocurrencies offer new opportunities to design for transitions from child to adult to support learning and changing monetary practices in the digital economy.

We recommend that the numerous emerging cryptocurrencies will challenge the perspective of such currencies as alternatives to fiat currencies and we instead view them as complimentary. An approach we believe should be wider adopted by design research in the area of Human-Currency Interaction. 

The increasingly complimentary role that cryptocurrencies are playing in the complex ecosystem of currencies is not to replace fiat currencies but to add value and possibility to the user. We therefore propose that a more integrated approach of virtual alongside fiat currencies should be adopted and designed for in human currency interactions.

Our research indidcates that the increasingly complexity of networks of value(s) entangled in social and environmental relations will increasingly center around new distributed models of value exchange through blockchain and smart contracts. We therefore call for a wide debate that draws value and values together in order to shift from the design of products or services to designing more broadly for &amp;quot;the propagation of value&amp;quot; in its idiosyncratic forms, especially as money has so many, often conflated value practices associated with it.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF7CA295-A2E9-4584-A7DC-64D845A7476B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca4fa9b219d5.93399125</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The GeoCoin platform uses smart contracting technology of digital currencies to create geo-fenced wallets based on phone's GPS location.
