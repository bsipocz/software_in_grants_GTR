Delivering successful urban planning training in SA Higher Education will thus make a key contribution to addressing SA national Government priorities around equity, social justice and democracy.

For many years post-colonial and post-apartheid SA has modelled its urban planning practices on Western systems which has been reflected in HE curricula. Concerns have been raised about the relevance and applicability of these Western theories and methods when planning African cities (Watson, 2003, 2009). To date, there has been little or no sustained work that brings together post-colonial and Southern debate theories with an examination of transferring northern planning theories to South Africa. Major uncertainties remain about HE and the appropriateness, usefulness and impact of planning curricula in the last 10 years and their associated teaching methods. The proposed research also aims to reflect more widely on the implications of the SA study for UK planning education; this is especially important given the recent increase in students from the Global South registering for planning-related courses in the UK.

O1: To investigate the social and economic value of planning education in SA particularly questions of equity and diversity in HE destination choices, graduation rates and employability outcomes.
O2: To deconstruct how the development and delivery of the urban planning undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum addresses issues raised by a changing post-colonial context in SA.
O3: Drawing on O2, to assess to what extent issues raised by a changing colonial context is considered and addressed in the UK undergraduate and postgraduate planning curriculum. By doing so and reflecting on lessons from O1, the research will explore the implications for urban planning lecturers in the UK when working with students from Africa and the wider Global South.
O4: To create a platform for ideas-sharing between SA academics, professionals and students across the world in order to connect and inform curriculum shaping, teaching methods and wider HE strategies for planning education (especially via SACPLAN)
O5: To develop a set of evidence-based resources for HE planning strategies that can address the Global South challenge in SA and across the wider continent.

The potential applications and benefits of the proposed research are diverse. There will be an immediate contribution to existing teaching programmes and to SACPLAN/RTPI strategies. There will also be a medium to long-term contribution through the way urban issues are dealt with in SA, what this means for planners when trained and re-trained (CPD) and for the content of planning curricula, teaching methods and thus planning policy. The main targets for dissemination of the project findings go beyond traditional academic audiences to planning practitioners, policy-makers and wider community groups. It will include the production of reports, briefing notes, good practice guides, evidence-based learning and teaching materials as well as academic papers and a book. The development of an online forum will maximise international dissemination of the project and provides long-term impact by creating a dynamic platform for debates among South African (and African) planners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As detailed in 'Pathways to Impact', a major programme of impacts, outputs and user-involvement activities is a core, scheduled element of the project. All materials listed below will be made available on the project and SACPLAN websites (available beyond the project's duration). Films will be posted on YouTube. Information will be distributed through relevant email-lists and social media. Key beneficiaries of the project include:

1. Planning courses accreditation bodies, specifically SACPLAN and RTPI
This project, developed in partnership with SACPLAN and the RTPI, will produce a range of open access online materials (briefing notes, curriculum review, good practice guides for teaching, recommendation reports including examples of best practices and 15 minute films). These online evidence-based resources will address specific sub-topics (e.g. diversity in housing in a post-colonial context; tackling urban poverty; tackling spatial segregation and spatial inequality). SACPLAN and RTPI will take part in seminars, workshops and end of projects events in SA and the UK. This will allow networking, mutual learning and partnership-building activities across a range of African countries.

2. National and International students engaged in urban planning education
Focus-groups and workshops with students and graduates (O1/O2/O4) are a key element of the project not only for data collection and networking, but also to foster their interest and engagement with addressing specific local issues relating to the urban planning curriculum in South Africa. The development of the online forum and the use of visual mapping should also create a dynamic platform for ideas sharing, learning and training across South Africa and beyond. This will be combined with the impact workshops and end of project events.

3. Policy-makers, community groups/NGOs, practitioners addressing African urban issues
Clear routes to national/regional impacts are in place via the South African team's partners (SACPLAN and related connections with planning organisations). Bespoke briefing notes/summary reports, films, impact workshops and end of project events will support policy-makers and practitioners as well as community groups/NGOs leading urban planning-related projects. Such activities are likely to produce meaningful impacts in terms of self-evaluation, changing organisational practices and longer-term enhancement of skills and capacities of personnel/organisations. The impact workshops and end of project events will allow for further discussion, networking and dissemination of knowledge across South Africa and the wider continent. 

4. Policy-makers, community groups/NGOs, practitioners (especially teachers) interested in addressing post-colonial issues in teaching delivery
As per point 3 - the South African team's partnerships generate clear routes to national/regional impacts in this field. All project materials will support policymakers and practitioners leading urban planning-related projects by better contextualizing their understanding of post-colonial urban space. Public, private and third sector organisations will be targeted to produce meaningful impacts in terms of self-evaluation, changing organisational practices and longer-term enhancement of skills and capacities of personnel/organisations. 

5. Wider international communities of stakeholders in urban planning issues
International impacts will be facilitated via engagement with the SA and UK project advisory groups (which will be composed of key academics and practitioners) and through the team networking activities. This will be supported by the various materials produced throughout the project and their wide dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>384150</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P00198X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>34457363-5AFA-40BF-BBA6-71DB708DF181</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Curriculum areas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1A4C7E39-EE28-48D9-AE87-3E028461DA42</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Elements of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>78369800-A95E-49BC-94E7-8659E5C2EFEF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geography and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A05AA82B-96A8-4834-97FE-23963DE22DB5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phases of education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
