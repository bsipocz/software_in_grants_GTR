In the vast majority of cases the physical size of the cavity components results in the repetition rate being in the 10s of Megahertz regime. It is often difficult to vary and if it is variable it generally involves a reconfiguration of the cavity. Similarly, the duration of the pulses produced by the mode locking technique are predetermined by the cavity parameters and are not readily selectable over large ranges. Optical filters can be placed in the cavity to restrict the bandwidth and so affect the temporal format of the generated pulses. However, inserting such filters usually requires a reoptimisation of the cavity and pulse widths cannot be continuously selected. This places considerable restriction on the versatility and applicability of conventional laser systems.
The configuration we propose employs a single pass technique. The repetition rate of the generated pulses is simply determined by the drive frequency to an in line phase modulator. In conjunction with a transmitting edge filter the signals are turned into a corresponding series of pulses. Since the input signal is also a continuously operating laser it can be easily tuned over the complete gain window of the seed laser. In order to achieve continuously selectable pulse widths from this assembly, use is made of the fact that they can be made operate in the soliton supporting region of an optical fibre. Here the nonlinear intensity dependent non linear effects can be balanced by anomalous dispersion. The generated soliton has a fixed &amp;quot;area&amp;quot;. The product of intensity and duration is constant, consequently if the soliton can be amplified, and this must be undertaken adiabatically, such that no energy disperses from the soliton, its duration will decrease. The slow, exponential gain provided by Raman gain in an optical fibre is ideal for this slow adiabatic amplification. Control of the gain, simply allows control of the pulse duration and by simply changing the pump power the output pulse duration is continuously selectable over a large range.
We propose to seed the system from a narrow line thulium fibre laser and amplify in a specially designed high gain Raman amplifier fibre in an all fibre configuration that will allow average powers of up to 2 watts, pulse durations selectable between 20 picoseconds and 200 femtoseconds, at repetition rates between 5 and 10 GHz . Extension up to 20 GHz should be possible in the near term. Using additional follow on in fibre non linear optical processes should permit continuous tuning from 1950 nm to 2500 nm, providing unique performance characteristics in a region of importance for medical application and molecular fingerprinting.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The unique characteristics of this proposed instrument should have potential economic impact . In the proposed work plan a key objective and deliverable at the end of this twelve month study is a fully operational fibre-integrated instrument that can be taken to potential commercial partners. The work is being undertaken in collaboration with two major international photonics based companies which could provide a direct route to commercial take up, however, in association with Imperial College Innovations and ensuring full protection of Imperial College's intellectual property right portfolio, the most suitable and beneficial conduit will be sought for the financial development of this instrument. This could and should involve other photonics based companies. 
In addition to fostering collaborations with Industry, the group at Imperial College have always placed emphasis on the training of personnel, the open exchange of information and the promotion of public information and education. If successful in application, this project, like previous high impact research projects undertaken by the group, will be presented at the Imperial College Science Fair, which is open to the general public and press and has a record of high attendance figures. The exchange of people and information between the group and our industrial partners will foster transfer of skills and knowledge.
The more general impact on society is likely to come via the commercialization of this instrument. Likely applications areas are the production of tunable mid infra red generation using several different nonlinear techniques. The ability to either produce broad band radiation covering the so called molecular fingerprint region or the production of high average power targeted wavelengths within this wavelength range for differential absorption measurements in compact configurations could lead to applications in defence or security through for example gas detection or more generally in remote sensing of industrial by products.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>111539</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>OFS Denmark</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration on development of dispersion shifted fibre for Raman gain in the mid infra red</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0CD8A8F-F8F4-45E4-8384-AB7F35D46215</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58739263c96826.16666345-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>manufacture of specialist Raman gain fibre to suit pump wavelength and obtain anomalous dispersion at 1950 nm</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>defined zero dispersion wavelength, specified Raman gain , optimized length for adiabatic compression</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>0</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>N/A</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>CB972697-197D-4E42-B29B-1E8C78DC46F5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>587394321fa271.91142593</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>It has been shown that an all fibre integrated source of wavelength tuneable, repetition rate selectable and pulse width selectable pulses can be generated from a source of cw laser radiation (which is wavelength tuneable either by temperature or by inclusion of a wavelength selective device, such as a fibre grating) by including an in line phase modulator (allowing repetition rates to be selectable up to ~20GHz) and an edge filter. Broad, picosecond pulses are generated, with a duration of approximately 20% that of the inverse of the repetition rate. Because of the energy loss of the spectral selection process, it is essential to amplify the pulses so generated before they can be controllably compressed in a distributed Raman gain fibre, ultilizing adiabatic soliton compression that is associated with a distributed Raman gain process in a following fibre. Typically pulses can be generated with selectable durations from about 10 ps to 500 fs . The greatest technological problem associated with the generation process is the production of a suitable fibre for the distributed Raman gain process. This fibre must exhibit normal dispersion at the pump wavelength for Raman gain and anomalous dispersion at the signal wavelength for soliton compression. A simpler and more economic and commercially attractive solution is to generate the pulses using a passively mode locked Tm fibre laser, where grapheme is used as a broad band saturable absorber, as was demonstrated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is a fibre integrated source. It can be used to pump an amplifier chain which with subsequent amplification can reach sufficient peak power for the generation of an infra red supercontinuum which can cover the mid infra red region. Application of such a source in the molecular fingerprint region should find boad application in spectroscopy or in the identification of dangerous gas in the security industry.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A6A1EA0B-AA9D-480E-8A1D-ECC98E405F77</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c1bce4a93227.02060334</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5BC557B5-1854-4385-A057-11834FC14CEE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mid-infrared Raman-soliton continuum pumped by a nanotube-mode-locked sub-picosecond Tm-doped MOPFA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dc854304d8ef3ee4531c9f74a4b38ee4"><gtr:id>dc854304d8ef3ee4531c9f74a4b38ee4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1094-4087</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56c1d17a1504a5.01588758</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K037056/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9CD2DA3B-F052-4076-95ED-10F46E76C382</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optics, photonics &amp; lasers</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3730AA1C-F09A-4945-8874-DEF6237C50CD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lasers &amp; Optics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>66CE6BAB-875D-4F4D-B415-F93CA7A2C4CA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optical Devices &amp; Subsystems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
