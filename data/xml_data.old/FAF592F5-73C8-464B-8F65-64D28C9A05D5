However, this has been acknowledged in China only recently but with more urgency due to the tremendous population size and predicted growth; China will have 64 older people for every 100 workers by 2025. China presents what is, in effect, a different ageing trajectory from European countries, and has unique characteristics shaped by its distinct historical, cultural, economic and political contexts. Recent demographic changes and significant economic transformations have led China to move from a traditional familial dominated elder system of care in which older people are being cared for by the extended family structure, to one which seeks to be based on efficient and sustainable social care support. The importance of building up a long-term care system to adequately and sensitively serve the diverse needs of ageing individuals appears however, self-evident for both Europe and China. In both settings, there is a persistently increasing trend for older people to choose to live independently in their own home (ageing-in-place). In Europe, care provision is being shifted to accommodate this trend, though it is acknowledged that this shift will require investment for homes that provide for independent or semi-independent living and that in doing so, can meet the range of later life physical needs. However, it is probable that targeted investment in adaptation for improved levels of accessibility and in specialised and/or supported housing for older people to live independently for longer in their own homes can lead to substantial cost savings in associated health and long-term care.

This research will attempt to contribute to the processes for meeting older people's needs in terms of these changes by exploring the relationships between living arrangement, living environment and the design of care delivery from technological, financial, political and social perspectives. Taking account of the factors that impact on the different ways in which older people in China, UK and France see care delivery, this proposal will build a common framework for the study of care delivery mechanisms and options available to older people that includes consideration of the role of cultural, socio-economic and welfare system dimensions. This will allow scenario building and in-depth comparative analyses among the three partner countries.

The study will use a mixed-method design, combining data mining and in-depth analysis, robust measures of the quality of the built environment, together with a participative action research approach to generate the engagement of key stakeholders and a range of qualitative data. It has six work packages which will be conducted in parallel in the three partner countries. The research will provide comparative studies and a synthesis that will inform recommendations to benefit China and Europe. 

The study will help understand ageing-in-place in the three countries and will identify common features for integrated care under different policy and society circumstances. It will examine the potential of such models, their impact on improvement to the care of older people and finance implications. The involvement of academic and non-academic stakeholders will strengthen the methods, reach and impact of this research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is the aim of this research to translate its findings as quickly as possible. This activity of translating research into action is something which the project team has rich experience in undertaking, as evidenced through projects such as Bridging Research in Ageing and ICT Development - BRAID, Assessing Needs of Care in European Nations - ANCIEN, Survey on Old People of Tsinghua, Development and Social Significance of Facilities for The Elderly, Understanding the Diversity of PPP Practices around the World, and networks such as Cogworks, Housing LIN and the EU-Asia Network of Competence Enhancement on Public-Private Partnerships. 

A range of guidelines will be produced by the research detailing how the built environment relating to housing design should be adapted, in addition to social and health care delivery guidelines, to meet the needs of older people and their families, and sustainable mechanisms to afford age-friendly housing. This information will be of direct benefit to policy makers, social and health care and housing providers who are in the position to modify and update policy recommendations relating to programmes of care delivery and design of homes and their affordability. In addition to policy makers, the recommendations produced will be of direct benefit to practitioners. Practitioners will use evidence generated by the project to inform the future planning, design, construction and management of home settings. Older people who have a good appreciation of ability to understand the value of good design of the built environment and, in particular, affordability and accessibility to decent housing will be in the position to impact further on the study through providing their future engagement and opinion. Their feedback and comments will be invaluable in terms of being able to influence policy and practice having evidence-based research at hand.

Through the subsequent change in both the domestic environment and in how social and health care is both managed and delivered within it, older people who desire to age-in-place will benefit through an improved living experience in terms of an environment that better meets their needs and promotes and improves their quality of life. They will have access to home settings that are more inclusive and that are able to facilitate increased mobility, autonomy, social connectivity and physical activity. 

The project will create in a locality within each country setting, a replicable process of community engagement for understanding, through experiential account and social network datasets, the effect of formal and informal network connections of the local older population. This will provide a basis for demonstrating the value of network oriented social care models as part of a framework of social care development and a way of enabling the impact for of the project's wider activity on participants to be captured and to complement testimonials and other forms of feedback from the stakeholders and user associations involved with the research - all of whom will be provided with the opportunity to comment on the study's findings and recommendations.

As a result of the adoption of the study findings, older people will have access to a supportive environment that will facilitate a personalised care delivery, improved mobility and enhanced participation in social and physical activity. As a direct result, it is anticipated that carer burden will be reduced. 

Researchers and academics within the study will benefit through their development of increased levels of multidisciplinary knowledge and the creation of a shared language through their involvement with the multidisciplinary work plan within the research. The working structure of the research project will provide an opportunity for those from all domains within the study to work together and hence gain a further insight into a number of new areas of work and multicultural awareness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>374609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tsinghua University China</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Real Estate Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Research workshop in Beijing</gtr:description><gtr:id>19EA9FDF-869B-48D1-B1F6-3BB1C516EBE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is current and has been listed under Key Findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff9c32e2390.14493850-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Each partner is leading 2 work packages.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This partnership led to the project co-funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC UK), the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR France), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC China).

Year 1 (2015-16):
In order to achieve Odessa's objectives 1 and 2, data from UK, Europe and China has been partially collected, sorted, integrated and processed. This data from harmonised surveys: CHARLS (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study), SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing), brings forth quantitative information on living arrangements and housing conditions of older people (60+). It sheds light on the dynamics of living arrangements, housing conditions, residential options, housing tenure and ageing (including last years of life), by looking at mobility or immobility choices. 
Firstly living arrangements of older people were defined according to every specific database. Then the data from each database was integrated, processed, and useful information related to the living arrangements of older people was extracted. Regression analysis was then conducted separately for the three databases to investigate the influential factors of living arrangement choices. Currently only data from CHARLS and SHARE databases has been partially processed and some of the preliminary results are shown below. 
In the Chinese context, prevalent living arrangements of older people and their residential options have been partially identified and assessed. In order to have a brief review and develop a model with a more comprehensive understanding of current condition, a preliminary regression analysis of CHARLS data was conducted. The factors of living arrangements considered in the model are: 
? Personal Characteristics (Preferences of older people, Ability to live independently, Health conditions, ADL [Activities of Daily Living], IADL [Instrumental activities of daily living], Functional ability, age and income level);
? Family features (Family modernisation with change of norms, attitudes and values, child characteristics, number of children in a family, Income levels of both parties and bequest tendency of older parents);
? Financial issues (Financial affordability and wealth of older people); and
? Policy Legislation (Availability of public transfers such as health insurances). 
The conclusions that were drawn through the regression analysis of the CHARLS data are as follows: 
? The four most important factors that affect living arrangements are IADL, presents of grandchildren, intention of bequeath and financial support from the government.
? Different significance factors in urban and rural areas are reliability towards children, intention of bequeath and government subsidies.
? Disability, social participant, source of medical expense, standard of living, grandchildren presence and intention of bequeath are the four possible causes of change of living arrangement.
? No impact on preference for case with spouse from variables. Social participant of older people only significantly influencing preference in the case of no spouse.
With respect to processing European data, a harmonized SHARE data wave 1 (2004) - wave 5 (2013) has been built, which includes demographics, income, wealth, a wide range of health indicators, activities, family relations, well-being, etc. Living arrangement has been defined based on household size and composition and distance between the older people and their children. Various graphs have been produced to give a better idea of the European context by analysing data from Sweden, Germany, France and Italy. The data looks at the living arrangement of 60+ people by age (60, 70, 80, 90 years) and country versus - 
? the distance from their child 
? living with a child in the same household or building
? having a non-co-residing child less than 1 km away
? having all non-co-residing child greater than 1 km away
? housing type i.e. house, flat or nursing home.

Objective 4 aims to propose design alternatives for age-friendly housing environments that support ageing-in-place, and in order to do so, firstly a detailed critical review of the literature was undertaken in the areas of: 
? Assistive Technology (Smart homes, Telehealth, Telecare, Smartphone applications, etc.)
? Universal design and Mobility (Design standards, Best practice, Policy and codes)
? Social and Community aspects (Nursing Homes, Residential Care, Sheltered housing, Cohousing, Neighbourhood networks, Ethnicity specific older housing, etc.)
? Designing for Dementia and Alzheimer Care (Design considerations, Specific assistive technology, Special needs, Best practice)
? International Good Practice (Centres for ageing research, Collaborative research projects, Policy and codes).

Achieving Objective 4 has led to the following developments currently:
? Variables for selection of case studies to visit. 
These variables were further divided in the themes of Universal Needs, Technological Amenities, Level of Support, Type of Housing, Living Arrangements, and Physical Amenities
? The choice of variables has led to the discovery of parameters of case studies that will be prioritised in this research - Living Labs (displaying the latest and new technologies); - Smart homes and Communities (equipped with smart technologies that help with ageing and assistive technologies such as telemedicine, telecare, remote monitoring, etc.); - Inclusive Design (universal design standards, accessibility, barrier-free spaces, etc.)
? A shortlist of case studies to visit in UK, France, China, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Spain has been produced by adhering to the above parameters. 
- In January 2016 the following Living Labs in the Netherlands were visited and studied:
Centre of Expertise Healthy Ageing, Groningen
Care Innovation Centre West-Brabant, Roosendaal
- Shortlist of Nursing Homes to visit in Beijing, China is complete (visit in April 2016)
- Shortlist of Living Labs and Smart homes to visit in France and Belgium is complete (visit in May 2016)
? A shortlist for conducting focus groups in UK, France and China is partially complete. 
Sites and people for focus groups in China have been selected and will be conducted shortly - Retired Professors from Tsinghua University and Beijing Forestry University, Beijing. 
? A checklist that facilitates better on-site study of case studies is also ready and has been tested. It is further categorised based on aspects such as: Physical, Sensory, Cognitive, Medical &amp;amp; Care facilities and Safety features
? A preliminary list of questions for conducting Focus Groups has been produced. 
The questions are categorised in wider areas of: Physical (Mobility), Sensory, Cognitive, Social and Health (Telehealth &amp;amp; TeleCare)
? A database of other Odessa-related European-funded projects has been developed. A Journal Paper detailing their unique research as well as their findings is underway.
? A Deliverable report titled 'Age-friendly Housing Environments' has been produced which highlights ageing and technology; technological trends in the UK, France and China (current as well as future speculations); and best practice case studies of age-friendly housing environments sub-categorised as Living Labs, Assisted Smart Living and Inclusive Design. 

Objective 5 assesses the social sustainability of existing schemes that promote ageing-in-place through private non-conventional, emerging financial channels. It comparatively investigates real estate securitisation in the context of healthcare REITs (Real Estate Investment Trust) between France, UK and Japan. Public-private partnership (PPP) options for nursing homes are also being compared between UK and China. Simultaneously viager or equity release is being compared between the French and UK schemes. The following preliminary results were obtained through a qualitative research approach, fieldwork surveys and outcome mapping: 
? There exists a niche market with a strong growing potential, bringing comparatively high risk-adjusted returns to investors. This can be treated as a potential resource for the industry
? French REITs focus on clinics while Japanese REITs on nursing homes. Both the cases involve financial support from the state which secures affordability
? Business models that secure long-term leases with occupiers limit the risk of vacancy and stabilise the property
? Uneven spatial distribution of healthcare facilities secures higher risk-adjusted returns expected by investors.

Year 2 (2016-17):
Work Package 1:
1. The main factors impacting elderly's living arrangement includes: personal characteristics (preferences, health conditions, and other demographic characteristics of the elderly), family features (norms and culture of family in China, number and characteristics of children in the family, income difference between adult child and older parent), financial issues (wealth of older people) and policy legislation (public transfer such as health insurance).
2. The absolute income of the elderly, the relative income of children to the elderly and the health status of the elderly are the main constraints on consistency between preference and actual choice of elderly's living arrangements.
3. We have carried out a comparative study on the elderly's living arrangements in China and Europe. The differences were examined from personal characteristics, family and social features, policy legislation and welfare state. China and Europe show a grand difference in personal/family characteristics, welfare system, social norms and housing market, which leads to different conditions of elderly's living arrangements.
4. In China, the housing asset shows heterogeneous effects on the elderly's savings and consumptions. We find a positive role of housing wealth increment on household consumption when elderly have higher income, level health status, or living with children. Thus, instead of a source of consumable gains, for the elderly in China, the housing asset is more regarded as a precautionary mechanism to fund against high uncertainty expenditures.
5. Through the survey of the elderly conducted in Beijing, we have found: 1) The number of children, health status and whether the care need is met are the key factors influencing the possibility of preferring living in nursing homes. 2) Whether to have unique child makes difference in elderly's preference of living arrangements.

Work Package 2:
1. WP2 developed a harmonized SHARE database, by merging data from wave 1 (2004) to wave 5 (2013), including variables related to income, wealth, health, activities, family relations, well-being, etc. 
2. Living arrangement (LA) based on household size, composition and distance to children was defined. 
3. Preliminary results on LA and housing choices in Continental Europe by age and cohorts were presented.
4. WP2 explored CHARLS data, defined LA in China, and sent the results and Stata program to WP1 team for collaboration
5. WP2 have identified context variables while working on the living arrangements.
6. A note about the treatment of children's variables in SHARE was written.
7. WP2 have run some regressions on living arrangements with CHARLS and SHARE data.
8. WP2 also worked on out of pocket expenditure for care.
9. Work on the Living arrangements using SHARE data has been finalised. 
10. The work on long-term care and health systems in Europe has been finalized. The 2nd Milestone Report entitled &amp;quot;Welfare state context variables in Europe&amp;quot; and a more detailed memo entitled &amp;quot;Long-term care and health systems in Europe&amp;quot; have been completed.
11. The work on the number of years in the accommodation (length of tenure) using SHARE data is currently being finalized. Length of Tenure (how long the 60+ have lived in their home) is important in order to assess the degree of residential mobility in continental Europe and China
12. The team is working on a definition of residential mobility between the SHARE waves that would be compatible with ELSA and CHARLS data. 
13. A new work on home tenure evolution in old age has been initiated (based on 6 waves of SHARE data) stressing the importance and meanings of living rent-free in some countries
14. Research on living arrangements conducted on Chinese data (CHARLS).
15. The study of long-term care needs of parents and location choices of children (based on a file of SHARE data at the respondents' children level) is on-going.

Work Package 3:
Any research project gives rise to 2 types of findings. One is based around the expected outcomes of the research and therefore derives from the results and analysis of the research. As this project is still in the data collection phase we cannot yet report on any research findings. The second type of finding is based on the process of the research and methodology. In each of the three countries whilst a standardised questionnaire has been developed and is being used, the method of administration differs. In the UK, a community engagement approach has been taken which requires collaborations to be developed between local people, organisations and our University. This is a time consuming and intensive exercise, as new partnerships have to be developed and non- academic community members have to be trained in research methods. There is a combined and collaborative effort in building capacity, enhancing citizenship and building sustainable relationships, which can continue beyond the lifetime of the project. To date this has been a very successful exercise. In Stratford Upon Avon we have recruited and trained 12 community researchers and in Norwich we have recruited and trained eight community researchers. Supporting this process has been the establishment and support of local steering groups. Members of the steering groups include Local Authority leaders, charitable organisation representatives such as Age UK and housing providers. The steering group will be instrumental in the dissemination of findings and developing interventions and strategies to improve the wellbeing of older people in their geographical locations. Regular meetings have been held with steering group members in order to update them on the connections made. 

Work Package 4: 
1. Qualitative analysis of data obtained from the three exploratory focus groups in Beijing, China. The data has been qualitatively analysed to determine the needs and gauge awareness of the challenges and strengths in the areas of housing design, assistive technology and care as perceived by the older people in China. Graphs, Charts and Correlation Mappings have been generated from the data using the NVivo software. 
2. Visits to all Best-Practice Case Studies have been completed and data has been collected from: 4 Case studies in Beijing, China; 8 case studies in the UK; and 4 case studies in France
- Visit to four older people's housing and care case studies in Beijing, China
- Visit to four 'Independent Living (with care)' housing schemes by Orbit Homes in the UK 
- Visit to two 'Extra Care' housing schemes by Ocean Housing in Cornwall, UK 
- Visit to the Trelay Co-housing Community in UK to study alternate ways of ageing-in-place through intergenerational contact 
- Visit to Mascot House, Newcastle which Is a sheltered housing scheme in the UK exclusively for Chinese older people
- Visit to four EHPAD's and Independent Living (with care) housing schemes in France
- Visit to case studies and research centres that conduct ageing related research in the Netherlands. 
3. Comparative Analysis of Case Studies and identification of Best Practices: Compiling all case study data from the different countries in a common spreadsheet so as to compare and analyse
4. Retrofitting Recommendations based on analysis of the case studies from all three countries and findings from the exploratory focus groups in Beijing, China
5. One Exploratory focus group conducted with a low income group community in Beijing, China. 

Work Package 5: 
I. The WP explores three different financial channels that are being developed to achieve ageing-in-place
a) Healthcare REITs managing care homes (France, UK, Japan- there are no China-based REITs). We fund that these vehicles are niche markets that primarily target upper middle-class households. Because financial investors take high risk premiums, the rents will maintain high levels, which will prevent these vehicles to become mainstream channels for the provision of care homes. The supply of residential services tends to focus on big cities, except in the UK where the portfolios show a more diversified spatial pattern. 
b) Viager/equity release schemes (France, UK&amp;not;-the mortgage market is still embryonic in China). The French and English systems are so different that it does not make sense to compare them. However, we fund common issues of spatial justice regarding the potential value that 'asset rich cash poor' homeowners can draw from their property according to their location. The worst situation is seen in France, where viager markets are not active outside central locations or upper-class neighbourhoods of Paris, Lyon and Cote d'Azur. 
c) PPP channels for the management of care homes (UK, China-the provision of homes through this channel is embryonic in France). In the UK, PPP schemes are being used by local councils to adapt some of their social housing estates to the needs of older residents. We have gained basic knowledge on these projects though desktop research, but we need to conduct fieldwork studies to make sure that these projects are satisfactory for both older residents and local councils. As for China, I did not have time yet to read the 5-pages paper in Chinese, but it does not document a case-study. 
II. Because financial channels are not being developed in China, this WP explores more conventional channels for the provision of senior housing in this country. Following an initial fieldwork study in Beijing in 2016, a PHD student supervised by Natacha Aveline has started to investigate the property market for senior housing in two tier-2 cities of contrasted situations: the inland city Zhengzhou and the coastal city Hangzhou.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Please note that this is the second year of the project, hence details below are preliminary and work in progress.
Year 1 (2015-16):
The methodological approach using comparative analysis and scenario building can be applied to other locations dealing with similar societal challenges.
The study and observation of various best practice case studies in Europe and China is useful in developing guidelines and recommendations for future research on ageing and care delivery in China as well as Europe. There is a wide range of knowledge that already exists - it is about bringing together care provision and technology and their socio-economic implications in two different cultural contexts i.e. Europe and China. There is a lot China can learn with respect to current developments in the field of ageing-in-place, care provision technology and older residential care in the European context. Similarly there is a lot that can be learned from the Chinese context with regards to living arrangements, social and economic adjustments as well as designing on a limited budget for several generations living together. 

Year 2 (2016-17):
Work Package 1: It provides understanding on elderly growth and their living choice, which is basis for further developing elderly livable housing and financial instruments.
It can be a supplementation for the existing database and will be used to do related spatial analysis.

Work Package 2: Our findings and work will be useful for the members of the ODESSA project working on WP1 and WP2.

Work Package 3: Replication of the community engagement process adapted for local study conditions.

Work Package 4: 
1. The findings from the exploratory focus groups will help decipher what Chinese older people would prefer/not prefer in terms of ageing in place. These findings will have further implications on Chinese policy in terms of older people's housing, care needs, technological needs, etc.
2. Unique, best practice case studies were identified in France, UK and China visited to be further analysed and cross-analysed by ODESSA Developed key contacts with industry and academia. 
3 and 4. Findings from above will have implications on design considerations as well as government policy
5. A focus group was conducted in a low-income community of Beijing so as to accommodate a diverse viewpoint for analysis 

Work Package 5: Our results on Viager and equity release schemes are potentially insightful for policy-makers. We will try to disseminate our future articles toward governments authorities in France and the UK.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D02C8C5B-96F8-4FE4-B69A-2778B9AD576A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dff2300ef856.59290949</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2016.1228853</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>30FFDAFF-D523-47D7-A835-D76FA789DF56</gtr:id><gtr:title>Housing assets to the elderly in urban China: to fund or to hedge?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Housing Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bf9c2d3260e115f51a5ebf8d4d07d149"><gtr:id>bf9c2d3260e115f51a5ebf8d4d07d149</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yang Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c90a2dd9f5b2.92312971</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F2E00F20-0524-43BA-B192-D1E84F8AC1B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Promoting Ageing-in-Place: Design of residential buildings for older people in China</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment-Behaviour Proceedings Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6ba828dc1766b2741daaf12544c1fb7e"><gtr:id>6ba828dc1766b2741daaf12544c1fb7e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gadakari T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a96a56b360b51.56106019</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L016095/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>FAF592F5-73C8-464B-8F65-64D28C9A05D5</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L016095/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>374609.12</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-02-17</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>8C946214-7FB3-4A98-A4DF-28A54204FFC5</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L016095/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>207006.42</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8785A44-DFE5-4A95-99D0-1A49582F1688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0E99303-35B5-4458-9B00-D93E2E075C9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Finance and Accounting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
