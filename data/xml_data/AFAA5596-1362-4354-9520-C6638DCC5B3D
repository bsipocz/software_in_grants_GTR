It is important testing area for central conjectures in the subject, such as the Tate, Beilinson and Parshin conjectures, but is also a rich source for discovering new phenomena. One of the major research directions of the area to arise in the last two decades is the study of these elliptic curves with the help of modular parameterizations by Drinfeld modular curves. Such parameterizations were successfully used to show special cases of the conjectures above, or prove other, more unexpected results. These developments required, and hence lead to a much finer understanding of these modular parameterizations, starting with the foundational work of Gekeler and Reversat. Not surprisingly the study of these parameterizations is now a very important subject of its own, with its own central problems. In this project we aim to resolve two central outstanding conjectures in the theory of modular parameterizations of elliptic curves by Drinfeld modular curves, namely Mazur's conjecture on the modular height of strong Weil curves, and the Gekeler-Reversat conjecture on the rigid analytic theta-functions of these modular parameterizations. We also expect that the methods which we will develop in order to resolve these decades-old conjectures will lead to the resolution of the uniform boundedness conjecture of Poonen-Schweizer, too.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries will be researchers in arithmetic geometry, especially those whose work concentrates on elliptic curves, abelian varieties or function field arithmetic. The proposed research will impact their work in several ways. They can use our prospective theorems in their work. Because the aim of the project is to prove several central conjectures in the area, I expect this portion of the impact to be very high. Moreover they can use the methods which we will develop in this project in their own research to tackle similar problems. In addition our prospective results will provide significant evidence for problems in nearby areas, such as Stevens' conjecture, so we expect that this project will reinvigorate research in this area, too. However the arithmetic of elliptic curves occupies a very important role within modern number theory and has significant connections to other areas of mathematics, including representation theory, group theory and algebraic geometry. Thus the results of this project will be of interest and high relevance to mathematicians working in these fields, too. By bringing some world-leading experts to the UK, the project will stimulate further interaction between them and British researchers in number theory. In particular the proposed research will clearly benefit the currently very active group of number theorists working at London, thus contributing to the development of the number theory community in the UK. Younger members of the group, including UK postgraduate students, will have the opportunity to interact with senior researchers in a constructive and intimate setting during their visit.

It is much more difficult to predict the impact on the society at large, since this is very much a pure mathematics project. However I have no doubts that such benefits exist. In fact pure mathematics is still the most efficient among all sciences in terms of positive effects to society, by comparing its enormous impact to the small costs its pursuit requires. The difficulty of predicting these benefits lies in the fact that they only appear long after the original research. One good historical example is the discovery of calculus, which is now the most fundamental subject taught at any technical or science-oriented university. It was originally invented by Leibnitz and Newton to solve problems in celestial mechanics, very much a pure mathematics project, and it took centuries that it become part of everyday life. Life is much faster nowadays, so we could expect positive impact in decades, even years. 

However I can still safely predict one very important impact; the proposed research will help keeping the public engaged in pure mathematics research. It is generally acknowledged that pure mathematics requires the greatest feats of thinking, and number theory is considered to be one of the hardest area in this subject. Due to this enormous prestige, proving important conjectures will lead to international recognition for the UK mathematics community. Such recognition will convince the public that British mathematicians do highly valuable work, and will generate more interest in the subject.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>342468</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research led to some unexpected and interesting relationship discovered between two different branches of pure mathematics, which might enable me and my collaborators to go beyond the original objectives of the research.

Particularly substantial are two directions into my research branched: the usage of homotopy theory in the study of rational points, and the development of various aspects of p-adic cohomology theory, motivated by my desire to generalise my older results to higher dimensions. My work on the latter object also lead to a nice result on the p-adic monodromy group of families of abelian varieties in characteristic p.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There might be potential application to cryptography, I will explore this by contacting experts and industry.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D3694DB3-5E61-4629-AE9E-5F4B08E23C7A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f649974d985.41562366</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8FBA05BE-E37A-414F-B0E5-A916CDFDE985</gtr:id><gtr:title>Curves which do not Become Semi-Stable After any Solvable Extension</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Rendiconti del Seminario Matematico della Universit? di Padova</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295"><gtr:id>c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>P?l A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddcaca20b2a2.04898769</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F527FD5-2583-4727-A574-2D6A2F10909B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pathologies of the Brauer-Manin obstruction</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mathematische Zeitschrift</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e089030479d570856a045874f4f2b528"><gtr:id>e089030479d570856a045874f4f2b528</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colliot-Th?l?ne J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc8c98be648.58131169</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0785CE3E-2EAD-4051-9EC9-7DFBFBCDB26D</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;Eacute;tale homotopy equivalence of rational points on algebraic varieties</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Algebra &amp; Number Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295"><gtr:id>c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>P?l A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc8c924ea35.60392271</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>20D70502-892F-470A-8396-3C93A864741F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hodge theory and the Mordell-Weil rank of elliptic curves over extensions of function fields</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Number Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295"><gtr:id>c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>P?l A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc8ca100fb2.62105115</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50A3B5EF-9245-45B6-8AD7-19F49E1F6F77</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Chow groups of certain geometrically rational 5-folds</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Number Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295"><gtr:id>c6cd7cca71838c54c4e8123cf0d40295</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>P?l A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc8c9dfaed9.04001721</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J005290/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
