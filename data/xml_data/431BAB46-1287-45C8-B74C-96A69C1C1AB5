High street retailers still find it challenging to communicate store atmosphere and excellent service via online communication. However retailers that operate single and multiple channel strategies can provide a range of valuable benefits for customers while still maintaining heritage, luxury status and service. This can be achieved by innovative use of new technologies and digital tools such as 3d body-scanning, style advice, co-design and interactive screening, which enables an online retailer to equal or surpass that of the physical retail environment. This is becoming a key strategy for the future viability of high street retailers, as additional channels can provide additional income. In particular for garments which need to provide an exceptionally good fit, the anthropometric data generated by sizing systems such as body-scanners can actually bridge the gap between &amp;quot;custom-made&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;mass-produced&amp;quot; and ultimately lead to a substantial growth of online sales.Anthropometrics, the study of measuring the human body, has been considered by tailors and scientists for decades, but instead of using traditional methods of measurement, a good fit can now be achieved digitally. The big question for high street retailers is how accurately? This project capitalises on the widespread use of standard devices such as mobile phone and home webcam technology to take a picture of an individual in their home, upload it and use it to produce accurate body measurements that will ultimately enhance customers' satisfaction by improving their online shopping experience on the retailer's website and by therefore reducing returns due to poor fit. The choice of the most suitable application is driven by our previous research. The application is novel since use 2D images to infer 3D bodyshape and has more potential to offer &amp;quot;true virtual fitting&amp;quot; as opposed to the ones which use user 2D measurement data. By virtue of this software application costumers are more likely to better match their shape and measurements to garment data by overall increasing their satisfaction with the online shopping experience and by thus reducing returns. This project will focus on user experience testing by integrating feedback from customers into sizing information and guidance to improve their online shopping experience and feedback into the garment information as well. The keys to this are the quality and accuracy of the measurements, overall user satisfaction with the online experience and effectively matching body and garment measurements so the consumer can find the best fitting clothing size. Drawing on our existing research, we specifically seek to assess the implementation and the deployment of a novel software application into the e-retailer systems so that if a customer uses widely available technology such as a mobile phone or webcam as a body scan device to shop and then later decide to return an item, it will be flagged up and the customer can be asked for feedback about the reasons for returning the item. This project is specifically framed around the user experience with the twofold aim to promote the elimination of waste through reduction of returns, and to increase customer satisfaction by addressing the balance between online and high street shopping experience within the digital era.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As a result of the introduction of the novel software application previously described, substantial benefits to the customers, the retailer, the fashion retail industry and to the society at large can be envisaged. 

The customers will benefit from: more choice of products; reduced prices; enhanced accessibility to the retailer; improved ability to match their size to the garment measurements; better satisfaction with the overall fashion online shopping experience; more awareness about their sized and thus more informed &amp;amp; responsible shopping behaviour; cost savings due to fewer product returns; a more personalised online shopping experience . 

The e-retailer, Change of Paradigm Ltd will benefit from: enhanced accessibility to the final customer; greater loyalty ensuing from customers satisfaction with the overall online experience; the opportunity to further streamline their CRM operations stemming from improved customers awareness about their size; enhanced labour productivity; cost savings due fewer product returns and to enhanced labour productivity; direct communication; new markets and additional sales, either to existing customers or through attracting new ones via a whole new global marketplace; the new communication opportunities of the software application provide the potential and easy access for positioning and diversification into new product areas; the opportunity to leapfrog stages of development; ultimately building a unique value proposition. 

Additionally the fashion retail industry at large will also benefit from the same benefits that were identified in relation to the Change of Paradigm Ltd following the further commercialisation of the software application. 

Society at large will benefit from: less waste as a result of increased customers awareness about their sized and thus more informed &amp;amp; responsible shopping behaviour; cost savings due to reduced waste disposal; reduced environmental impact associated with fewer product returns.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85121</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of the project have been particularly useful to the commercial partner, a fashion online retailer who was able to implement a size advisor on its website. The implementation has resulted in increased online sales and significantly lower returns by in turn reducing the environmental impact of the online fashion retailer and by thus enhancing its image in terms of CSR. Additionally the findings have been disseminated in a wide range of international peer-reviewed publications. In particular, the project has been instrumental to publish 1 journal article, 2 book chapters and the work has been presented at 2 high-profile international conferences and published in the conference proceedings. Two book chapters are currently in progress and have consolidated the ongoing collaboration between LCF and the University of Canberra.
Additionally the findings have been shared in an industry symposium that has been organized in July 2015 and was very well received by the industry. The symposium has been particularly useful to establish new contacts both in the industry and in academia and provided enhance visibility to the project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CC2DB959-F3E4-4A5F-A92F-318564CD4EAE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc9e73452833.45680357</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the e-Size project was to asses how software aimed at capturing consumer body measurements and providing accurate garment size recommendations can benefit the retail industry, by improving the online shopping experience, increasing fashion garments online sales, and reducing product return rates due to poor fit. 

Two distinct size adviser applications were integrated into the website of an online menswear retailer, and through a series of live user tests, online surveys, focus groups and interviews, the project demonstrated the added value that using this software can bring to online retail operations. The results of the surveys and focus groups showed that the majority of users had experienced difficulty when shopping online, with eighty per cent having purchased a garment online that didn't fit them correctly. 

The most significant finding of the project was the high rate of consumer satisfaction with the software. Using a size adviser application increases consumer confidence when shopping online, makes them more likely to shop with a retailer in the future, and improves the overall online shopping experience. Users found the applications quick and easy to use, and ninety per cent of users who took part in the testing would be willing to use the software in the future. The majority of users received the correct size recommendation when using the application. 
 
A key outcome of the project was a series of recommendations for further development of size adviser software, based on user feedback. Users expressed a strong preference for a more visual based recommendation, for example, showing a garment on a virtual model, as opposed to just a text based recommendation. Additional information about the garment size, such as highlighting areas where it is too tight or too long, adds to consumer satisfaction with the online shopping experience. Even if they wouldn't purchase the size recommended to them by the size adviser, the consumer would use the information provided by the size adviser to make an informed decision. 
 
Another key finding of the research was the importance of accurate garment data for online retail. In order to integrate a size adviser application into their website, a retailer needs to know key measurements for each garment, and without accurate data from the manufacturer or wholesaler, this cannot be achieved without manually measuring garments. 

One of the most interesting finding of the e-Size project was that size alone is not the main consideration when purchasing a garment. The style and fit preference of the consumer (for example, some people prefer to wear tight fitting or loose fitting clothing, irrespective of what size fits them correctly) also plays a major part in the decision making process. This finding opens up new questions on size versus fit, and how both of these factors can be successfully integrated into an application is an area that can be explored with further research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the e-Size project can encourage adoption of size adviser software, and demonstrate to retailers that it offers them an advantage in a crowded marketplace, particularly for online retailers who lack a physical store presence, or small retailers with limited resources. The results of the project show that by integrating a size adviser applications into their shopping platform, retailers can engage with consumers who are reluctant to shop with a brand they haven't purchased from previously, as the size recommendation increases their confidence in online shopping. 

The size adviser application market is constantly increasing, with more and more providers offering their own software. The findings from this project offer existing software providers recommendations on how they can improve their product, particularly regarding how the size recommendation is visualised to users of the technology. Emerging software providers can use the findings to gain new customers by demonstrating the impact their application can have on online retail operations and consumer loyalty. 

The findings can be taken forward by academia to conduct further research into the use of size adviser applications for womenswear, and how incorporating style and fit preference into the size recommendation can affect consumer satisfaction and online sales.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>19B8F248-C882-4010-975B-0958FFEFA508</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>560ad0a055e1b0.08051991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>253159B1-E453-4363-9530-9CF7B7ED233D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The e-Size project - Intelligent integration of a sizing framework into online fashion retail</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7550217fe9f89ac2a7e8b9594d6e1e02"><gtr:id>7550217fe9f89ac2a7e8b9594d6e1e02</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vecchi A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cc9de73c8045.89360342</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F347D2F4-54E2-4B65-A503-70955CB73A72</gtr:id><gtr:title>Looking for the perfect fit?
