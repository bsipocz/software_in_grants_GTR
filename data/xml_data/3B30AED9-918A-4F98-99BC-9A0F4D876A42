The original motivation was to provide a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. At the same time, from the very beginning of the subject, it was anticipated that operator algebras form very interesting structures on their own right and will have applications to unitary representations of groups and operator theory in Hilbert space. Actually, much more turned out to be true. After some dramatic and unexpected developments, the theory of operator algebras has established itself as a very active and highly interdisciplinary research area. Not only do there exist - as initially envisioned - strong connections to quantum physics as well as representation theory and operator theory, operator algebras nowadays have far reaching applications in various mathematical disciplines like functional analysis, algebra, geometric group theory, geometry, topology or dynamical systems.

One of the most important classes of operator algebras is given by C*-algebras, which are defined as norm-closed, self-adjoint algebras of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. As in many areas in mathematics, advances in the theory of C*-algebras went hand in hand with the discovery of interesting and illuminating examples, the most prominent ones being group C*-algebras and C*-algebras attached to dynamical systems, so-called crossed products.

The main objects of study in this research project are given by semigroup C*-algebras, which are natural generalizations of group C*-algebras. Our goal is to analyse the structure of semigroup C*-algebras and to use this construction as a tool to study groups and their subsemigroups from the point of view of geometric group theory. Closely related to this, this project also aims at a better understanding of the interplay between C*-algebras and dynamical systems.

Our project lies at the frontier of current research. We take up recent advances in semigroup C*-algebras, classification of C*-algebras, the interplay between C*-algebras and symbolic dynamics, as well as the discovery of rigidity phenomena in operator algebras and dynamical systems.

One of the key characteristics of our research project is its high interdisciplinary character. It lies at the interface of several research areas in mathematics and brings together expertise from different fields. This takes up the trend in mathematics that interactions between different branches are becoming more and more important. Therefore, the mathematical community as a whole benefits through an active and inspiring exchange of ideas.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Apart from academic beneficiaries, our project also has potential economic and societal beneficiaries, which we now describe:

We plan to organize an international conference on C*-algebras of semigroups and dynamical systems. This event will stimulate an active and inspiring exchange of ideas beyond subject borders. The conference will be a perfect opportunity to disseminate our results. We will particularly encourage young researchers like PhD students to participate. For this purpose, we will offer to cover travel expenses and cost for accommodation for them. Moreover, since the conference is to take place at QMUL, it will increase the reputation and visibility of our School of Mathematical Sciences on an international scale.

Furthermore, since our proposed project opens new research directions, it creates excellent opportunities for young researchers and allows them to learn methods and techniques from several mathematical disciplines. This has a value outside academia as well, since it trains strong analytic skills which are becoming more and more important in economy and society. In particular, the training of highly skilled UK PhD students in mathematics is vital to the UK economy, for instance the financial sector. Therefore, I intend to engage in activities with an emphasis on training young researchers like PhD students or postdocs. A good example for such an event is the Oberwolfach Seminar &amp;quot;K-Theory for Group C*-Algebras and Semigroup C*-Algebras&amp;quot; in October 2014 which I am co-organizing. The seminar takes place at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, a renown research centre which organizes mathematical conferences. The Oberwolfach Seminars address PhD students and postdocs from all over the world and are supposed to introduce them to particular hot topics. Furthermore, the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach supports publication of the lecture notes of these seminars, published within a book series called &amp;quot;Oberwolfach Seminars&amp;quot;. This would be an excellent opportunity to make our research available to a wider audience.

Moreover, since economic and cultural contacts to China are becoming increasingly important, I plan to establish very close connections to Chinese researchers and Chinese research institutions. I have excellent contacts to Chinese colleagues, for instance to Guihua Gong (Puerto Rico and Changchun, China), Hanfeng Li (Buffalo and Chongqing, China), Huaxin Lin (Oregon and Shanghai, China) or Guoliang Yu (Texas A&amp;amp;M and Shanghai, China). My plan is to promote an exchange with Chinese colleagues and institutions, both on a research level and on a cultural level. This will be achieved through research visits and conferences. For example, I gave invited talks at the conference on &amp;quot;Noncommutative Geometry&amp;quot; at Fudan University in Shanghai (China) and at the &amp;quot;China-Japan Conference on Noncommutative Geometry and K-Theory&amp;quot; at Jilin University in Changchun (China). Moreover, in connection with QMUL's partnership with the Chinese Scholarship Council, I plan to take Chinese PhD students who will work on topics closely related to our proposed research project. Apart from the academic benefits for the students and the benefits for economy and society I already mentioned, this will also lead to a cultural exchange with the people in our school, for instance with our PhD students from Europe.

The proposed research project contributes to a better understanding of C*-algebras in general. Given the traditionally strong links to quantum physics, there are natural connections between C*-algebras and quantum information and quantum computing. These emerging fields have the potential of leading to new applications which could become economically important on the long run.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100454</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The funded research focused on two main topics, semigroup C*-algebras on the one hand and Cartan subalgebras in C*-algebras and their connections to continuous orbit equivalence in topological dynamics and quasi-isometry in geometric group theory on the other hand.

Concerning the first topic, we have continued the study of C*-algebras attached to semigroups. One main result was the observation that for semigroups from number theory, our C*-algebras encode very interesting information about the original number field. In particular, we obtained a result relating K-theoretic invariants with the class group of our number field (published in Advances in Mathematics in 2016). This points to interesting connections between operator algebras and number theory, which we are currently exploring in joint work with G. Cornelissen. Our findings on semigroup C*-algebras have been summarized in a short overview article in the Proceedings of the Abel Symposium 2015. Moreover, together with J. Cuntz, S. Echterhoff and G. Yu, we are in the process of completing a book on semigroup C*-algebras and their K-theory.

The second topic is of highly interdisciplinary (or intradisciplinary) character as it combines the research areas C*-algebras, topological dynamics and geometric group theory. In this context, we studied Cartan subalgebras in semigroup C*-algebras and graph C*-algebras and showed that these are very helpful to study C*-algebra structure (our paper will appear in International Mathematics Research Notices). Furthermore, we initiated the study of continuous orbit equivalence, which is a notion of orbit equivalence for topological dynamical systems. In particular, we explored rigidity phenomena (our paper will appear in Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems). We also built the bridge to geometric group theory by giving dynamic characterizations of quasi-isometry (our findings are available on arXiv). Finally, together with S. Barlak, we found a connection between Cartan subalgebras and the UCT problem, which is one of the big outstanding problems in C*-algebra theory (our work is available on arXiv).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work has a highly interdisciplinary (or intradisciplinary) character and will thus be beneficial for researchers working in different areas. In order to disseminate our results, we have presented our work at several conferences, for instance in Shanghai (China), Oberwolfach (Germany), Aberdeen (UK), Muenster (Germany), Fortaleza (Brazil), Seoul (Korea), Orlando (US) or at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Sweden. In order to increase the impact of our research, it will be crucial to exchange ideas and collaborate with mathematicians in various areas, including operator algebras, in particular C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, topological dynamical systems and geometric group theory. Our plan is to foster such interactions in the future, for example at international conferences.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>77BCABAC-EE71-42A1-BAAA-9906F044D2FE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6ef6cc3b790.68677793</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A1CF62F0-78A0-45F5-B1FB-7985C821B22F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cartan subalgebras and the UCT problem</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad75a7220a6b0dc8620a4cd49125a173"><gtr:id>ad75a7220a6b0dc8620a4cd49125a173</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barlak S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-8708</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a34f3742ccab0.13933429</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>70816F60-167D-46F4-8B74-5FB556469D46</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic characterizations of quasi-isometry, and applications to cohomology</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>arXiv e-print</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb"><gtr:id>93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>589b489f9a3c07.90936048</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AD714849-1B54-4269-AB32-4ED5E94E5480</gtr:id><gtr:title>Continuous orbit equivalence rigidity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/49ea9bae905bef270a6046ba9c07c4d8"><gtr:id>49ea9bae905bef270a6046ba9c07c4d8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LI X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589b4a858e9624.78762661</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4523F846-0424-4BC6-B0E5-72CB9F38A42A</gtr:id><gtr:title>On K-theoretic invariants of semigroup C*-algebras attached to number fields, Part II</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb"><gtr:id>93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ae298fcfca15.49259991</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>65EDC4D0-E634-4727-A766-24AB27BD7ABD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Partial Transformation Groupoids Attached to Graphs and Semigroups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Mathematics Research Notices</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb"><gtr:id>93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589b477c47ad81.98480111</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M009718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>67</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
