A very good example of this is how Scottish tartan was revitalised in the 19th century by the allocation of clan names to particular colour and pattern sequences. Tartan continues to make re-appearances in the fashion market through designers such as Vivien Westwood and Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana. Another example of cultural revitalisation is how, in the 1950s, the basic twelve bar form of blues music was transformed into rock and roll and thence into rock music. This traditional form of music is continuously revisited and revitalised.

The researchers have been involved in a number of revitalising projects such as: at Leeds Cassidy has worked on a PhD project which examined traditional Korean Bojagi fabrics, used as wrapping materials, and experimented successfully with these to form fashion fabrics; at Lancaster Walker and Evans are working on two PhD projects exploring the role of design in the revitalisation of traditional crafts in Northern Thailand and Turkey.

The authors of this proposal wish to undertake a major study to examine both existing and new case studies and to provide a model to enable future designers to use traditional cultural products, patterns and processes as new, contemporary products, patterns and processes. Apart from journal papers the outcomes will include a book consisting of case studies and an explanation and discussion of the proposed model.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will be researchers, practitioners, and educators within the design community and producers, suppliers and consumers of culturally relevant designs, products and practices. The following strategies will be used to achieve impacts of the research beyond academia:

- Early engagement of project aims with appropriate stakeholders such as The Crafts Council, Royal Society of Arts (RSA), etc.
- Consultation with design practitioners though networks such as the Design Council, the Design Business Association (DBA), etc
- Dissemination of in progress and final research outputs through a curated public exhibition at the Peter Scott Gallery, Lancaster, UK
- Publication of a book summarising the research undertaken within the project.

The impact upon the beneficiaries of the research is thus: design practitioners will be provided with a framework which will allow them to effectively explore culturally relevant designs, products and practices, and how in turn these might be revitalized using contemporary technologies, processes and communication strategies; consumers will be provided with fresh and exciting designs, products and awareness of processes of cultural relevance; commerce and industry will benefit from the development of commercially sustainable modes of engagement with culturally relevant designs, products and practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238856</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - 31st World Cultural Council Award Ceremony &amp; Aalto University Academic Summit, Finland: Creativity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01B76442-FA7C-49A5-8BD0-94B21F998461</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote: Creativity - the imperative of solitude, 31st World Cultural Council Award Ceremony &amp;amp; Aalto University Academic Summit, November 18, 2014, Helsinki, Finland.

This workshop introduced to a new audience - and informed participants - our newly developed CREATIVE ECOLOGIES diagnostic research tools. It enabled us to test these tools in a particular location with a highly active and well-informed audience. The benefit we found was that by engaging in the process, the participants revealed to themselves (for the first time) the richness and variety of creative activities that were occurring in their locale.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a49a0bad9fc7.04206688</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://designroutes.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - Middle East Technical University, Ankara: Imagination's Promise</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E46EFDF0-CF2F-48F8-B10F-CF96E869C052</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote Talk: Imagination's Promise: practice-based design research, Faculty of Architecture, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, 24 March 2015.

The workshop comprised 1) an overview of the Design Routes project including its aims and work to date, 2) group engagement with revitalisation strategies through worksheets and examples of strategies, and 3) a discussion and feedback session. Participants were encouraged to select culturally significant design, product and practice that was meaningful to them (often drawn from their own culture) and use this as a mechanism to explore the veracity of the revitalisation strategies. Hosted at the University of Helsinki, 17 undergraduate craft education students plus 3 staff members comprised eight groups who were each provided with strategies and examples from one of the eight revitalisation clusters. Participants applied these strategies to an example of a culturally significant design, product and practice example they were familiar with. Positive feedback was received from participants with results demonstrating how the strategies could be employed to generate novel outcomes that hitherto may not have been considered. Key insights identified the need to refine and simplify strategy descriptions and to provide a breadth of examples to best convey the possibilities of the revitalisation strategies. This workshop has led to an ongoing research network which it is intended will lead to a Horizon 2020 proposal to the forthcoming 'Societal Challenge 6: Europe in a Changing World - Inclusive, innovative and reflective societies' programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58caad84337481.47811617</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EXHIBITION OPENING SPEECH - Canberra: Object Therapy Exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>09069712-033E-41D2-9F20-139985FCD5FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote: Object Therapy Exhibition Opening Speech, Hotel-Hotel, Canberra, Australia, 14 Oct 2016

The workshop in Estonia was hosted by the Estonian Native Crafts Department in the Viljandi Culture Academy at the University of Tartu. 18 students studying Estonian native crafts plus 4 member of staff comprised eight groups who were each provided with strategies and examples from one of each revitalisation cluster. Taking a culturally significant design, product and practice example they were familiar with, each group considered how they could use these strategies for revitalisation. Key insights included the value that the structure of the taxonomy of revitalisation clusters and strategies provided to the ongoing work of the Viljandi Culture Academy with participants, including staff, noting how this aligned with their approaches, and the potential to use these strategies to revisit many native Estonian crafts. Valuable feedback was gained from the participants across the workshops that helped to i) understand how to effectively articulate the overall concept of revitalisation, ii) refine how individual strategies were described, and iii) how best to collectively communicate these strategies as a prospective tool for revitalisation. This workshop has led to the development of an ongoing research network which it is intended will lead to a Horizon 2020 proposal to the forthcoming 'Societal Challenge 6: Europe in a Changing World - Inclusive, innovative and reflective societies' programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58caae0fc74f96.79644395</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - MAKLab, Glasgow: Design Shift 2.0</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E9A4071-3B60-4E33-8A2A-F18B8EAF7A48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote: Design Shift 2.0, MAKLab, Glasgow, 6pm August 28, 2015.

Key research findings are organised around two thematic areas - Creative Ecologies as a means of understanding the context in which craft makers operate, and Revitalisation Strategies that can be employed to make culturally significant designs, products and practices relevant to contemporary lifestyles. Combined these approaches provide a means to understand revitalisation from the 'outside-in' (macro) and the 'inside-out' (micro) perspectives.

Revitalization requires an in-depth understanding of the cultural context in which the design, product or practice is based before any design-led intervention can successfully take place. Our research revealed the need to respect and value tradition and heritage and use this understanding as a trigger for reimagining for the future and, given that tradition and heritage are not fixed and often develop organically over time, care and sensitivity to retain the enduring values that give meaning in the first place.

The revitalisation strategies offer a set of approaches that can be selectively employed, individually or collectively, to reconnect traditions, values and beliefs with modern ways of living. The eight clusters of revitalisation strategies have been identified:

? SUSTAIN THROUGH DESIGN - combine traditional making or use practices with new or reimagined designs
? TRANSPOSE TRADITION - take traditional designs or making practices into new contexts
? VALUE OF PLACE - foreground the value of place and associated provenance
? PRODUCTION PROCESSES - employ appropriate and effective methods of making
? SKILLS - employ targeted approaches to embed and enhance skills
? PROMOTION - spread awareness and appreciation via effective promotion
? ENTERPRISE - employ effective business, organisation and finance models
? RESEARCH &amp;amp; EDUCATION - learning about traditions, meaning and contemporary relevance

Revitalisation, however, does not occur in isolation but within a creative ecology, i.e. the context in which craft makers operate. This broader environment and the conditions required to support a sustainable creative culture, involve many interconnected factors. Alone, they may not be able to support revitalisation, but their collective contributions can be significant. The notion of a creative ecology helps to structure how we may understand the conditions that enable culturally significant practices to flourish. Consideration of individual factors can be useful in decoding the underlying structure and the various interactions within a given context. Historical factors and serendipity can play important roles in how a particular ecology develops but this is be accompanied by range of purposeful activities that help shape the ecology into a preferred state. This interplay is something that may not be easy to understand or predict.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key research findings organised around two thematic areas (Creative Ecologies
