Problems arise, however, when the doctor cannot find a disease to explain the aches and pains. The aches and pains alone then become the problem and the aches and pains alone define the disease. These types of aches and pains, that don?t have any known disease as a cause, are called ?functional?. There are many functional pains including fibromyalgia, where patients report feeling bruised all over, and several types of low back pain. These problems are common, accounting for roughly one out of every five visits to a family doctor. The problems are also very difficult to treat with around three out of four patients still suffering from the same aches and pains more than ten years after their first visit to a doctor. During that time the aches and pains reduce quality of life, often prevent or reduce the ability to work and may have other bad effects on health. There is a pressing need for improved understanding and treatment of these functional pains. The lack of any obvious disease in the body to account for the aches and pains has led to an increasing interest in how the brain might respond to pain in these patients. Modern brain scanners allow us to peer directly at the living, working brain and we have developed a series of procedures that allow us to change a person?s pain experience while they are scanned. One surprising finding is that a mild pain that follows a strong pain is not felt as painful. Recently we have discovered that this surprising fall in pain is due a small part of the brain becoming active and somehow blocking further pain experience. We want to know if this small part of the brain is working in the same way in patients with unexplained aches and pains. We suspect that it is not. If we are right, then our studies will provide a way to explain why some patients feel aches and pains even though their body is not injured and there are no signs of disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>When no objective changes explain a patient?s subjective experience of pain the pain is described as ?functional?. Well documented functional pain disorders include fibromyalgia and non-specific low back pain. Functional pain reduces quality of life, generates considerable health care costs, decreases work-related productivity and may increase mortality. These disorders are common in the general population, with estimates of chronic sufferers ranging from 5-20 percent, and there is currently little effective medical therapy. The apparent absence of peripheral disease has led to increasing interest in brain mechanisms and physiological dysfunction. We have developed a procedure that produces dramatically reduced pain experience despite the presence of an objective physically noxious stimulus. In summary, volunteers receive a noxious stimulus for 6 seconds followed by a more noxious stimulus for another 6 seconds and then the stimulus returns to the original noxious stimulus for a further 6 seconds. If pain experience follows the stimulus, as might be expected, then the volunteer should report an equivalent magnitude increase and decrease in pain experience for each transition. In fact, volunteers report dramatic pain reduction when returning to the original noxious temperature and this reduction is significantly greater than that observed when delivering a continuous noxious temperature. This phenomenon has been called ?offset analgesia? and is assumed to involve active control of noxious information descending from the brain. We provide empirical support for this assumption by demonstrating that offset analgesia involves activation of the periaquaductal gray (PAG). The PAG is a key region involved in descending noxious inhibition. Patients with functional pain may have dysfunctional descending noxious inhibition. The current application will directly address this possibility using our offset analgesia procedure with fibromyalgia and non-specific low back pain patients. Brain activation in patients and matched controls will be assessed using fMRI and proposed functional connections from the PAG region addressed using dynamic causal modeling.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>204095</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MOD, Woolwich</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78B93FA1-2843-432A-85E0-08A611EB175A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 25 servicemen attended a talk on pain.
