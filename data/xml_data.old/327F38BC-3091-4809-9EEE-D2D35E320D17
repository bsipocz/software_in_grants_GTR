This unique opportunity has arisen through archaeological recovery of human remains from the site of Basur H&amp;ouml;y&amp;uuml;k located in the Upper Tigris Valley, a region that has been very important in understanding the large-scale interactions of the first urban polities in Mesopotamia. Sitting astride several important trade routes, the cemetery uncovered at the site provides an insight into the Early Bronze Age period (3100-2800 BC), which follows the withdrawal of Uruk (Southern Mesopotamian) influence from the much larger region but comes before the consolidation of the first urban states at places like Lagash. The changing political and social organisation of this period is not well understood and due to modern conditions, very little is known about the Upper Tigris region. However, recent excavations have revealed a cemetery containing elite burials, evidence of human sacrifice, and a mass death pit; three very different burial contexts which provide the perfect template to examine the changing social roles defined through burial practice. 

The introduction of human sacrifice to the region has been argued to reflect the changing function of burial rituals and shifts in social organisation that are firmly linked to the rise of early states and kingship. This project will detail the differences (or similirities) in access to resources, general health, and kin relationships between the burials in the three very different types of grave to outline the social context of these new burial rituals. The project brings together the analysis of bioarchaeological information on the human remains such as childhood health and lifetime stature, disease burden, and cause of death with the analysis of thspatial and social context of each burial. Stable isotope analysis will compare ratios of Carbon, Nitrogen, Strontium, and Oxygen in different individuals and between tissues representing childhood and adulthood in the same individual to address issues of access to resources (e.g. meat) place of origin, and lifetime mobility. An ancient DNA assay will be used to investigate population relationships and test for the presence of pathogen DNA in the death pit. Brought together with a comprehensive 3d reconstruction of each burial, this will form the a uniquely complete picture of a society that has adopted radical burial practices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Project will have considerable impact beyond academia. The CO-I (BH) has a demonstrable track record of considerable public engagement and outreach work that will amplify impacts beyond key regional and national heritage and scientific partners. These are outlined below:

1. Policy Makers. The introduction of several new scientific techniques to archaeological research in the region is expected to both highlight the importance of the archaeology of southeastern Turkey within the Turkish Ministry of Culture and also to influence future policy decisions on appropriate research funding and project outcomes. 

2. International Organisations. In highlighting the importance of this project, it is expected that several international organizations active in heritage preservation and conservation will take a renewed interest in developing sustainable archaeological practices in the region. The international nature of the research will cement ties between prominent US and UK institutions, between the UK and Turkey through such organizations as the British Academy Overseas Institute in Ankara (BIAA), and provide a template for future collaborations.

3. Commercial and Private Sector. As the main excavations are carried out in advance of construction, this project will allow commercial enterprise to see a demonstrable benefit from responsible corporate behaviour. Smaller local businesses in the region may also benefit form an increase in interest in the site. Currently, there are extensive plans to the Siirt Museum complex into an accessible multi-use site incorporating park space, public facilities such as sports equipment and picknicking areas, and commercial enterprises such as tea rooms and tourism-related shops.

4. Professional and Practitioner Groups. The excavations are active training for new generations of archaeologists, and this project will provide an example of an integrated bioarchaeological practice. This will apply to UK archaeologists and UK students who are integrated into the project through teaching and training activities including through lectures at University College London, training schemes at the Natural History Museum, and practical bioarchaeological fieldwork opportunities in western Turkey at Ege University. Further training and teaching opportunities will apply at the Center for Advanced Isotope Studies in Athens, GA. This project will also provide training for Turkish archaeologists and students in biomolecular archaeology and bioarchaeology, including sampling protocols and research design. This will include a significant number of ethnic minority Turkish students and archaeologists who have strong attachments to the region under study but are traditionally underrepresented in archaeology and in higher education as a whole. 

5. Third sector. There is expected to be considerable benefit to third sector parties, particularly museums. The local museum (Batman Muzesi) will benefit from increased outreach components in terms of awareness and interest in collections currently held. The Siirt Museum planned for construction at the completion of the Ilisu Dam project will be dominated by material and activities related to the excavations at Basur H&amp;ouml;y&amp;uuml;k. Training in archaeological sampling methods, research design and additional support in outreach and educational material and activities will be provided to these local museums.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>547820</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R00353X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A30C52-7659-4E94-B5E2-F9BB53767467</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeological Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Prehistoric Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science-Based Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
