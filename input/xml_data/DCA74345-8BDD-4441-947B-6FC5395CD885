It is recognised that other factors than those related to environment issues influence the adoption of mitigation practices in the agricultural sector, namely economic impacts associated to management practices. There is clear evidence that policy makers and agro-food businesses are interested in understanding the different components needed to successfully implement sustainable interventions. There are several tools that help stakeholders to account GHG emissions associated to management practices, which practices can mitigate GHG emissions, and what are their associated mitigation potentials. The University of Aberdeen is involved in the development of two of these tools, the Cool Farm Tool and more recently the CCAFS mitigation tool. But tools by themselves are not of much use without the knowledge on how to use them to provide solutions. In this KE fellowship I will co-create, with researchers and committed tool users, effective economic indicators to inform farmers and advisors to policy-makers about the economic impact of practices that reduce GHG emissions. I will measure the success of the project by monitoring the adoption of practices that reduce GHG emissions, in a two year period, in the case of the Cool Farm Tool users. For CCAFS mitigation tool, case studies will be used to demonstrate how the information provided has been used in the design of national programmes for climate change mitigation on agriculture as well as supporting the adoption of sustainable practices. 
The programme of work will be structured around scheduled engagement events with CCAFS and Cool Farm Tool users, especially workshops. I will also seek to engage early with on-going NERC funded research and KE to identify synergies and further opportunities for knowledge translation, more specifically: Claire Feniuk &amp;amp; Andrew Balmford at University of Cambridge, mapping of landscape features to biodiversity; Ann Bruce at University of Edinburgh, working on social indicators of sustainability; Mat Williams at University of Edinburgh, leading the GREENHOUSE consortium, Laura Vickers at Harper Adams University, working on horticulture crops and Claire Quinn at University of Leeds, working with M&amp;amp;S. The main engagement commitments I will have are: 

1)Meetings with researchers to assess expertise on an indicator of economic impact associated to the implementation of practices in the CCAFS and Cool Farm tools;
2)To organise workshops with CCAFS and Cool Farm tool users to monitor the influence these indicators will have on farmers' implementation of agricultural practices during the period of a year &amp;amp; to assess the ability of the indicators to drive positive environmental change together with the users of the decision tools. 

Behaviour change theories will be explored in these workshops. The Defra Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory Discussion Paper &amp;quot;Understanding behaviours in a farming context&amp;quot; (2008) will be used. Other theories might also be explored for suitability. For example, the website https://www.forumforthefuture.org/thebigshift gives examples of how businesses shape and influence the whole sector within which they operate - whether that is food, energy or beyond. A psychological model such as the Theory of the Planned Behaviour might also be tested. This theory states that the performance of a certain kind of behaviour is determined by three kinds of beliefs: one's beliefs about the likely outcomes of the behaviour and the evaluation of these outcomes, normative beliefs about what other people do and what they expect a person to do, and finally beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or hamper the performance of the behaviour. In this case, I will liaise with my colleague Dr William van Dijk who applied an extension of this theory in his PhD project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101473</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nestl?

The work was expected to involve a diverse range of stakeholders including farmers, River Caldew catchment, co-operative, Defra, Rivers Trust, and United Utilities etc. Water was chosen as the cross cutting case to show the links with other benefits (e.g. biodiversity, GHG emissions, soil protection, soil quality, flood alleviation). The aim is to develop quantitative model (integrative and flexible) to measure sustainability.

The Theory of Planned Behaviour has been used as a framework to formulate the questions and to analyse the data. The objectives are to understand farmer's motivations to adapt to environmental change and mitigate GHG emissions and to understand the efficacy of the CFT in advising farmers about the best options to reduce emissions from their farms. The intention was also to understand if farmers are aware of the costs of sustainable agricultural practices and if saving money one of the main reasons why sustainable practices are implemented. The discussions with he farmers in the U were very lively and we maintain the contact with the farmers. We have sent the transcripts of the interviews, information about climate change and sustainable practices and will send them the preliminary results and the results of our discussions.

This work integrates behavioural sciences (attitudes, perceptions, behaviour) with environmental sciences (ecosystem processes), economics (valuation) and policy analysis (incentives) to assess multiple benefits of protecting natural capital. The integration of these disciplines is essential in order to better understand farmers' motivations to implement sustainable agricultural practices and how to provide recommendations to measure the benefits.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bdd41ee7f160.83484607-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Co-design of the interview guide and co-design of the GHG emission accounting activity using the Cool Farm Tool with the farmers.

Farmers enjoy discussing about solutions in a group and some changed something 
Farmers are only willing to implement practices that have no monetary cost to them/saves money
Farmers are aware about the mismatch between lower prices and the costs to comply with environmental requirements (e.g. CFT reporting)
Farmers would like incentives that are not volatile
All farmers interviewed showed some level of custodianship and this can be further explored.

The message about reducing GHG emissions in agriculture should be shaped to take into consideration: 
Farmers' definitions of good farmer: &amp;quot;good animal care&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cleanliness&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;beautiful farm&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;good waste management&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;look at environment as a whole&amp;quot;
Within the profit-oriented type of farmers there different personality &amp;quot;nuances&amp;quot; (e.g. pro-environment, sceptical, enthusiasts)
Local conditions/context: e.g. being located in California is different from being located in Michigan in terms of why farmers do what they do.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Powerpoint presentation
