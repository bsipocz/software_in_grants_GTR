However, with increased population mobility and the tendency for some conflict to be cast around religious difference it is critical that the social sciences return to religion as a centrally important tenet. This project considers religious difference alongside spiritual need in relation to the case of global seafaring.

The research will make an important contribution to our understanding of how multi-faith groups peacefully co-exist and what factors may disrupt/threaten social harmony in religiously diverse populations. The project will focus upon seafarers from different countries and of multiple faiths living and working together on ships and in ports. In the context of the challenging social circumstances where they live and work (confined in relatively small spaces on board working cargo ships and largely isolated from wider society) it will explore how they understand their own spirituality and that of colleagues and how they manage/experience religious needs/expression. 

Traditionally ports in the UK and US have provided chaplaincy/welfare services to international seafarers of multiple faiths in an effort to meet a variety of spiritual/social needs. These past and present services will also be a focus for the research. Archive data will be collected charting the historical development of chaplaincy in ports in the UK/US. In addition, contemporary chaplains will be included as participants in order to understand how they shape and practice their respective religious beliefs, alongside their vocation for ministry, and how their organisations have changed over time in relation to their objectives and practices in funding such ministry. 

This combination of research concerns will provide the opportunity for us to analyse seafarers' own religious perspectives and attitudes towards other faiths; seafarers' spiritual needs; available support for seafarers' spiritual needs within the confines of ports; access and experiences of such port-based welfare/religious services (from the point of view of seafarers) the objectives of organisations providing chaplaincy in ports and their associated plans for the future. 

Three aims guide the project 1) We aim to inform better welfare/spiritual provision by organisations working in ports to seafarers calling at them 2) We aim to gain a better understanding of how traditional/non-traditional religions/spirituality are expressed, experienced, and negotiated in ports and in multinational residential workplaces (i.e. ships). 3) We will explore the evolution of religion in limited but important situations outside congregations and formally designated religious sites. In this we aim to add to academic understandings of contemporary 'religion' and its diversity and to study religion/spirituality beyond expected locations (e.g. churches/religious communities).

The study has 4 main components. 1) Historical examination of archive material relating to the development of welfare and religious services in US/UK ports 2) A series of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholder organisations, which fund/manage current port-based ministry and welfare 3) Port-based ethnography focussing on observation of chaplaincy 'in action' and interviews with key participants/providers 4) Shipboard ethnography focussing on seafarers and their spiritual/religious practices/needs/expression.

This bi-national case study will be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team of sociologists and theologians. It will assess continuities/discontinuities between ports in terms of provision and the diverse ways religion is present on cargo ships. This will be of practical value to seafarers and those attempting to meet their spiritual/religious needs, of academic value to scholars of religion and the workplace, and of general value in raising awareness of a vital but neglected area of modern economic life.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will highlight areas where port-based chaplaincy/welfare services are in need of development. It will provide seafarer welfare organisations with knowledge about users' needs in relation to the provision of welfare/spiritual support services. This will benefit them in targeting services thereby reducing waste and maximising the benefits accrued from available resources. The study will identify religious/spiritual needs that are currently neglected in UK/US ports and/or where barriers impair access to existing provision. The project will also provide knowledge of the areas of support which are currently highly valued by seafarers and which organisations could usefully prioritise and/or expand. The project will thereby provide seafarer welfare organisations with up to date evidence relating to seafarers' changing needs which will inform future resource planning and allocation. In the development of this application for funding we have involved several international religious/welfare organisations, e.g., ISWAN, ICMA, NAMMA and have benefitted from their thoughts and input. They have emphasised that they would use the project findings to inform and/or adjust existing policy/practice. 

The project will provide chaplains and all those personally involved with the provision of chaplaincy/welfare services with insight into the ways in which current provision is generally received/perceived. Such feedback (including via a practititioner workshop) will enable them to reflect on practice and make improvements as necessary.

Policy Impact

The project will improve the understanding of religion in society, workplaces, and communities. It will be valuable to:
- national/local government/non-governmental organisations, in informing responses to the changing nature of religious/spiritual need in a globalised economic context 
- organisations concerned with developing community cohesion, enhancing health and safety, and creating economic and social stability
- unions (national/international) and employers who wish to improve the conditions for maritime workers
- employers of multi-ethnic/multi cultural workforces who seek to establish harmonious relationships/teams

The project has the potential to impact upon the implementation of the International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) code across the world. This international regulation has resulted in some seafarers being denied access to shore leave because of their nationality. In some cases seafarers may be repeatedly denied shore-leave by the immigration authorities associated with the ports where they call. As such we will liaise closely with the Centre for Seafarers Rights in New York which has been campaigning around this issue for some years and which would benefit greatly from the contribution of new evidence in support of their efforts to protect seafarer welfare/human rights.

Raising public awareness of seafarer needs (via the release of a video) of the findings could result in increased financial contributions to welfare charities from members of the public and from employers. Such additional resources would have a direct impact on welfare provision for seafarers and would be on benefit to all seafarers calling at ports internationally (from Singapore to Dubai and from London to Nova Scotia).

Teaching/training impact: The project will feed into the training of chaplains and of port welfare workers across the globe for example via the NAMMA webinar programme which Sampson has previously contributed to. 

The project advisory group will ensure that stakeholders are brought together and that they inform all aspects of the project development and application. The group's first task will be to identify additional ways to disseminate the research findings and achieve impact in a diffuse stakeholder community making use of their own networks.

Findings are also expected to have application in other residential/institutional settings e.g. schools/prison.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>573928</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N019423/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35CC531E-67B1-44F7-83DF-824B0C49CF9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Contemporary Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC4405D9-8A0D-41F9-B71A-A19C9CD0AEFA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnicity</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70CA9DF8-AFD4-43E6-BEE7-634724581BE7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inter-faith Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
