The aims of this project are to facilitate the synthetic biology of bacterial cell division and its relationship to chromosome organisation and segregation by uncovering mechanistic details of those processes in unperturbed bacteria and in squeezed bacteria growing in nanostructures. The understanding and novel reagents we generate will then be transferred to in vitro liposome experiments. This application was submitted too the ESF EuroSynBio initiative, and is one of four proposals recommended for funding. It is a collaboration between the Oxford Laboratory and Petra Schwille in Dresden and Cees Dekker in Delft, both of whom have received matching funding from their respective national agencies. Central to this project is the exploitation of a novel microscopic technique ['slimfield' microscopy], in combination with 4D multicolour epifluorescence microscopy, and controlled targeted protein degradation. Together, these allow us to visualize the assembly, action and disassembly of molecular machines that function in cell division, and chromosome segregation, and to relate their structure-function-dynamics to the processes of cell growth and chromosome-replication-segregation. The methods allow us to visualize single proteins in millisecond timescales, with ~ 5 nm precision, conditions when their position and action is not clouded by their diffusion or dynamic movement. Furthermore, we wish to visualize several components of macromolecular complexes simultaneously, and to be able to inactivate or remove specific components of a complex by using either small molecule inhibitors, or by targeted protein ablation. The molecular understanding that emerges from this work will be applied to my collaborators in vitro and 'squeezed' in vivo systems. 1.To determine the stoichiometry, spatial distribution, dynamics and turnover of divisome and related components. 2.To understand the sequential assembly of the divisome in time and space and to relate this to growth and chromosome replication-segregation. 3. To use targeted protein ablation to reveal organization of the divisome and how this relates to cell growth, chromosome organization and segregation. 4. To use the same techniques to investigate equivalent biological processes in squeezed cells [with Dekker] and model liposomes [with Schwille]. Reductionist biochemistry and molecular biology have been very successful at identifying proteins and characterizing them structurally and biochemically. Furthermore, classical genetics has been successful in identifying the types of biological process in which particular proteins functions. The challenge now is to determine how proteins function in the living cell; in particular where and when they function and in association with which other cellular components. The techniques used in the applicant's lab now allow us to approach this goal. This understanding will inform and facilitate the synthetic approaches adopted by the Dekker and Schwille laboratories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aims are to facilitate the synthetic biology of bacterial cell division and its relationship to chromosome organisation and segregation by uncovering mechanistic details of those processes .

The impact for human health and disease is alluded to in the previous section. Bacteria are not only involved in disease but are beneficial in many ways and are responsible for most bioconversions. Genomic information for bacteria is enormous and is revolutionizing our understanding of their importance. The synthetic biology approach here provides an enormous opportunity for exploiting understanding of basic life process mechanisms. We expect biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries to benefit from this research and the educational system from primary schools on.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>355946</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>they provide new opportunites for anti-bacterials</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7C629449-0BCE-48B6-A62C-F41DC4330C9E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>58982b44943ac7.51230547</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Subsequernt work has validated our findings and led to new insight into the coordination of replication and cell division</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As with all advances in biological understanding, the knowledge gained acts as a platform for future studies</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>39E7F298-234B-4D32-9BA1-69BAC2C5C561</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58982ae6dc8ac3.49960453</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CBD45540-4B8B-481F-8F55-08F061BF1AA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>MinC, MinD, and MinE drive counter-oscillation of early-cell-division proteins prior to Escherichia coli septum formation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>mBio</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4acc73635366075ec638b04e85d840f5"><gtr:id>4acc73635366075ec638b04e85d840f5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bisicchia P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b310cb3fdd1.95520960</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4FD86ABC-99EE-41B4-A86C-25455572DEC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The N-terminal membrane-spanning domain of the Escherichia coli DNA translocase FtsK hexamerizes at midcell.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>mBio</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4acc73635366075ec638b04e85d840f5"><gtr:id>4acc73635366075ec638b04e85d840f5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bisicchia P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b310c840b41.16121048</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C73A1327-4587-449A-B08E-03C61CBDFDA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Robustness and accuracy of cell division in Escherichia coli in diverse cell shapes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f6147f1b6dfcbdff01a0bee5a63df04a"><gtr:id>f6147f1b6dfcbdff01a0bee5a63df04a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>M?nnik J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03a03a7669e27</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I004785/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
