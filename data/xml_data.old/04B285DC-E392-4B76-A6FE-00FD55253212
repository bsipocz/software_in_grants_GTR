ODD-word] manuscript for a single-author monograph on Western European Liberation Theology, 1924-1959. The completed final draft has been sent off to Oxford University Press on 24 August 2007.
My manuscript is a transnational study of ferment in the Catholic Church, which polarised the Catholic community in western Europe and found concrete expression in the development of a new theology, complete with a set of innovative apostolic social movements developing within and beyond the confines of official Catholic Action. The geographic focal points of my study are France, Italy and Belgium, although references to parallel processes operating in other European theatres are alluded to as well.

Although the most important developments in the process of the genesis and evolution of new tendencies within Catholic theology, political action and social movement activism occurred in the central two decades between 1934 and 1954, the chronology of my manuscript encompasses a larger period. The chronological point of departure is the birth of 'specialised Catholic Action' in the early-to-mid-1920s. The Catholic Church hierarchy had for some time prior to the 1920s begun to sponsor a new apostolic movement 1 Catholic Action 1 aiming to recapture for the Catholic faith increasingly secularised social milieus. Originally conceived of as cross-class efforts to evangelise the modern world, the birth of the Belgian Young Christian Workers in 1924 inaugurated a new period in which new Catholic Action groups were founded, organisations which were geared towards specific social milieus and which often left a maximum degree of
autonomy in the hands of associated members. It was the dynamic unleashed by what became known as 'specialised Catholic Action' which turned out to be the underlying motor force behind the various subsequent social movements and theological currents at the centre of my monograph's concerns. The period of concentrated innovations came to a close with the Vatican-enforced shutdown of the worker priest experience in 1954/55. Yet my manuscript covers the succeeding years up to 1959 as well, updating the history of reform-oriented currents within western European Catholicism to 1 quite literally 1 the eve of Vatican II.

My conclusion highlights the centrality of the aforementioned currents for the overall evolution of the Catholic Church in subsequent decades and around the world. The innovations of Vatican II built on and codified many of the changes pioneered by the cohort of individual thinkers and social movements under review, and indeed virtually all key persons discussed in my monograph played important roles in the course of Vatican II. At the same time, I argue that the development of subsequent Liberation Theology, first in Latin America and then in other corners of the 'Third World,' encouraged and inspired by the spirit of Vatican II, must likewise be seen in a line of continuity with earlier shifts in orientation for Catholics, developed by the tendencies at the centre of my study.

In short, western European Catholic reform movements and theologies played an all-important pioneering role within twentieth century Catholicism. Though by the mid-1950s under heavy attack from conservative forces within the Church, their trailblazing innovations prepared western European and world Catholicism for the innovations soon propounded by Vatican II. Anticipating many of the themes of subsequent experiments in Third World Catholicism, the individuals and movements can be aptly subsumed under the label of Western European Liberation Theology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18066</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E50471X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>61B990B8-E8CF-4876-B8AE-E00F07CCE8C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Church &amp; Theology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
