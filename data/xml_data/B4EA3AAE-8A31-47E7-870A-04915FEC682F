Currently the only truly effective treatment is gut bypass surgery. This is very expensive to perform and can only be used on the most obese people. A more practical approach would be to develop a drug therapy. However many systems in the brain and in the periphery are involved in the regulation of appetite and energy expenditure. Therefore if we are to develop a successful drug to treat obesity we need to understand these physiological systems. Glucocorticoids are hormones thought to be involved in the regulation of appetite. They are produced by the adrenal glands and have a major role as part of the stress response. Glucocorticoids are commonly given as a treatment to patients. One of their main side effects is increased appetite and obesity. However it is not currently known whether they are important in the day to day regulation of appetite and if so where in the body the effect on appetite regulation occurs. I have conducted pilot experiments which suggest that they act in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus and increase food intake and reduce energy expenditure. This project will establish the importance of glucocorticoids in controlling food intake and energy expenditure and determine if they may be important in the development of obesity. The project is based on manipulating an enzyme which produces glucocorticoids called 11betaHSD1 in the brain. Currently drugs which inhibit this enzyme are being trialled as potential treatments for obesity and its related disorders. However these treatments are not designed specifically to target11betaHSD1 in the brain. It is possible that drugs which specifically target the brain may be more effective and reduce side effects. The work in this project will provide the evidence for this and may lead to development of more effective therapies for treating obesity and related conditions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Glucocorticoids have a wide variety of functions and are classically thought of as part of the stress response. They are known to pharmacologically powerfully regulate both food intake and energy expenditure. There is extensive evidence for a role for glucocorticoids in the pathogenesis of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. However, the role of locally produced glucocorticoids in the hypothalamus and their physiological role in appetite regulation is yet to be established. A contributing factor to this is the difficulty in manipulating glucocorticoid levels long-term in specific hypothalamic nuclei. To overcome this difficulty I will use rAAV to express a glucocorticoid regulating enzyme, 11betaHSD1 (rAAVHSD1) which acts to increase glucocorticoid levels. I will target expression in the arcuate nucleus of adult rats. My pilot data confirms that injection of rAAVHSD1 into the arcuate nucleus results in an increase in corticosterone levels which is localised within the arcuate and does not affect the corticosterone levels in neighbouring hypothalamic nuclei. Further injection of rAAVHSD1 into the arcuate results identified a powerful hypothalamic effect of glucocorticoids in the regulation of energy homeostasis. This project will investigate the physiological role of glucocorticoids in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. This will establish the importance of glucocorticoids in the day to day regulation of food intake and will improve understanding of how modulation of glucocorticoid activity by inhibitors of 11betaHSD1 may be working in the hypothalamus to act as potential anti-obesity therapies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will improve our understanding of the role of 11betaHSD1 in the brain and its effects on food intake. This is of high importance as 11betaHSD1 inhibitors are already being developed. A better understanding of the effects of central 11betaHSD1 activity on food intake, body weight, energy expenditure and non-glucocorticoid hormonal regulators of appetite may lead to the development of more efficacious agents. Furthermore development of more tissue specific 11betaHSD1 inhibitors which also target the CNS may avoid some of the side effects seen with non-selective agents. 
 
The use of rAAV stereotactic injection to study upregulation of an enzyme in a specific region of the brain may interest other researchers who may be carrying out neuroscience research in other fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>276567</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Endocrine Society Conference (Edinburgh)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B127A8DE-8C8F-438C-ABA0-011992517B43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave an oral presentation entitled .
