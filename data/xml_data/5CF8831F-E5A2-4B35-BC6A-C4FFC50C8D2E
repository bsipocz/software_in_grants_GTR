This review has identified the current position of CYP in research into the criminal justice system in the UK, and suggested a model of justification for involving them. The evidence shows that there has been a genuine progression over the last decade in terms of ensuring the participation of CYP. Participatory research would seem an effective way of ensuring CYP can challenge negative perceptions, stimulate change and become visible in a positive manner. Any research involving CYP needs to be clear in its focus and purpose, and provide opportunities for CYP to engage in a meaningful and relevant way, in order that it can enhance their well-being and be mutually beneficial. In this way CYP can become active and empowered citizens in their own communities and beyond. On the basis of the evidence we recommend that researchers examine their motives carefully, work in partnership to share knowledge and skills, and collect evidence from CYP about 'when' it is appropriate to involve young people in research, and 'which' young people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20199</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mediating encounters - the use of visual images in participatory research, paper in the symposium 'Mediating encounters: Theory and practice of using visual methods to aid participation in educational research', BERA conference, London, UK, September 23rd</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B1F2336-44DB-4EE6-A572-B731140430D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research methodology workshop will address the context of participatory research with CYP and will cover the development of participatory research and associated policies over the decades.

Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources Used
This workshop explores methods that aim to be participatory, which is how we, as researchers, are accustomed to working (Clark et al., 2001; Clark, 2004; Woolner et al., 2010). Visual research methods may facilitate participation through their perceived inclusivity, being less demanding of literacy skills (Lodge, 2007; Prosser, 2007; Clark, 2005; 2010), but are also empowering, allowing participants to 'set the agenda' (Prosser, 2007:24). Using mediating visual items gives researcher and participant something to create, look at or discuss together, 'bridging gaps between the worlds of the researcher and the researched' (Harper, 2002: 20), which potentially enables participants to drive the encounter. It is necessary, however, to question how we understand and analyse the results of these encounters, remembering that they are products of the context and the task demands (Croghan et al., 2008), with meaning for us as well as for our participants (Piper &amp;amp; Frankham, 2007). 


The workshop is intended to enlighten and inform the research community. In particular, we aim to contribute to the following outcomes:
For educational researchers:
? Inspiring them to consider different ways of involving children and young people in research
? Giving them the knowledge , skills and confidence to be able to use visual methods in their work.
For Children and Young People:
? By encouraging researchers to think about using methods that are appropriate to CYP, and the context of the research, we aim to encourage better engagement by CYP and more inclusive practices in order that children can have their voices heard, and ultimately be enabled to contribute in a positive way to social change.
For us:
? We hope to be able to explore with participants the potential applicability of our methods in other European contexts in order to inform our own work in furthering the effective participation of children and young people in research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54608653dd6eb5.68497146</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The involvement of young people in research within the criminal justice area - what do we know and what do we need to find out?

Jill Clark and Karen Laing will talk about their on-going AHRC study which is a scoping review of the research into the evidence of participation of children and young people (under 18) in, and with criminal justice research. The challenges and issues of crime and the criminal justice system are those that effect all communities and all connections between them. In meeting these challenges, a perspective that has been largely but not wholly absent has been that of young people. We are interested in a continuum of involvement from accessing of views to the participation of young people in solutions. The review is focusing on sub-themes pertinent to young people and include fear, perception and experience of crime (as victim and perpetrator); views (and experiences) of sentencing and punishment; fighting crime and prevention and offender re-entry and resettlement. A further focus is on the levels of involvement of young people in the research, ranging from being subjects of the research to being active partners in and with the research. This paper will present our findings to date and will explore the following: What kind of involvement has there been of young people in research within the criminal justice area? In what areas has there been no involvement of young people at all? Why and when do we involve young people? What are the ethics involved? What are the issues of power and voice? What is the level of involvement, e.g. as researchers, as activists, facilitators, observers, etc.?

However, there is less evidence of reflection on their own rationale and commitment to participatory approaches and even less so on the practicalities of just how we can do this well (Clark &amp;amp; Laing 1012).

The young people involved were
all engaged in projects to improve their local communities, and wished to find out more about how they could engage with local
people using such research processes as asking the right questions, analysing data and presenting results. Groups of young people travelled to
Newcastle University to take part in a weekend of activities aimed at increasing their research skills, and enabling them to undertake research in
their own community. Through games, practical activities and discussion, young people explored aspects of research such as:
? What is research? And what is data?
? How to ask a good research question
? Interviewing and data recording techniques
? Making sense of data and identifying key messages
? How to present key messages to others
? Participatory methods
Some of the young people subsequently conducted independent research with 60 community members about the use of electronic cigarettes,
and successfully developed key themes from that research, producing a radio show to disseminate their key messages into the community. The
young people who took part later told us that they had not realised the significance of their learning at the time of the training with us but we noted
that their new awareness of their ontological and epistemological stance coupled with practical ways to conduct research had enabled them to
enact their agency more effectively. It would seem that attending the research day had enabled research skills to become more accessible to
young people, and increased their capacity to engage with their own communities.
Young people's participation is research has been a topic of much interest in recent years, as researchers grapple with the place of young
people in research. Co-production of research with young people is growing in popularity. Rarely, however, are young people positioned as
researchers in their own right, using research as a means of understanding their own communities in order to effect change. New conversations
are needed both with young people, and within the academic research community about how we can support and upskill young people as
researchers, what kinds of skills and competencies they need and how we can enhance the capacity of young people to effect change in their
own communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a089d969a8.39531682</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.bera.ac.uk/beraconference-2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young people presented alongside Dr Jill Clark and Karen Laing at the conference, presentation was titled: Involving young people in research: Learning from their experiences</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BE854DB-131E-4762-921F-4741DFCEA58E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>6 young people involved in a film about alcohol awareness went on to develop a resource to complement the films. 4 of these young people took training in research methods at Newcastle University (with Jill Clark and Karen Laing) where they learned about: what research is; the role of a researcher; how to plan research; specific methodologies; and how to analyse and use the findings. They planned a piece of work to undertake in schools using visual methods. The young people enjoyed their experience and learned much:

 When I went down to Newcastle, I did'nae have a clue about research - I thought I did - but I did'nae. When you asked us to get into it, I realised I would'nae have known where to start! And if I did start, we would'nae have got as far as we are now. (young person)

Following their involvement with the University, the young people were invited to present their experiences of working with a University research team at an academic national conference 'Youth Matters' in June 2016. As part of the preparation for this, they produced a video and practiced a presentation which was delivered at the conference and was very well received by all attendees. At the conference they were the only 'genuine' young people presenting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a5cec8d6d2.81188198</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ncl.ac.uk/media/wwwnclacuk/geographypoliticsandsociology/files/Programme%20conference%20day%20final.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference paper: Clark, J. and Laing, K.

This research methodology workshop will address the context of participatory research with CYP and will cover the development of participatory research and associated policies over the decades. The workshop will consider the context of visual methods and tools and how these can be used in an innovative and creative way to conduct research with CYP. Participants will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of the methods and then experience the practicalities of completing and designing these methods themselves. The concluding section of the workshop will explore the analysis of data produced through these methods, considering the quantitative as well as the qualitative possibilities. 
Participants will have the opportunity to circulate amongst a 'carousel' of three different activities which will provide examples of visual methods:
1. Diamond ranking has been used in classrooms to explore and clarify the feelings and thoughts on a topic and is usually carried out with pre-written statements. At the workshop, however, participants will have the opportunity to learn about and try using this activity with visual images instead (Clark, 2012).
2. Photo-elicitation and beyond: talking about, choosing and ranking pictures. Methods will be demonstrated of using the immediacy of photographs which are alternative or complementary to the semi-structured qualitative interview through photo-elicitation.
3. We will facilitate discussion and practical experimentation with different visual techniques to engage children and young people in research, such as: fortune lines; spider diagrams; PMIs, and drawings. These methods can be used flexibly in different contexts and provide a toolbox of ideas that researchers can draw on when conducting research in an inclusive way.

Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources Used
This workshop explores methods that aim to be participatory, which is how we, as researchers, are accustomed to working (Clark et al., 2001; Clark, 2004; Woolner et al., 2010). Visual research methods may facilitate participation through their perceived inclusivity, being less demanding of literacy skills (Lodge, 2007; Prosser, 2007; Clark, 2005; 2010), but are also empowering, allowing participants to 'set the agenda' (Prosser, 2007:24). Using mediating visual items gives researcher and participant something to create, look at or discuss together, 'bridging gaps between the worlds of the researcher and the researched' (Harper, 2002: 20), which potentially enables participants to drive the encounter. It is necessary, however, to question how we understand and analyse the results of these encounters, remembering that they are products of the context and the task demands (Croghan et al., 2008), with meaning for us as well as for our participants (Piper &amp;amp; Frankham, 2007). 


The workshop is intended to enlighten and inform the research community. In particular, we aim to contribute to the following outcomes:
For educational researchers:
? Inspiring them to consider different ways of involving children and young people in research
? Giving them the knowledge , skills and confidence to be able to use visual methods in their work.
For Children and Young People:
? By encouraging researchers to think about using methods that are appropriate to CYP, and the context of the research, we aim to encourage better engagement by CYP and more inclusive practices in order that children can have their voices heard, and ultimately be enabled to contribute in a positive way to social change.
For us:
? We hope to be able to explore with participants the potential applicability of our methods in other European contexts in order to inform our own work in furthering the effective participation of children and young people in research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54608566884a24.89518999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Theory and Practice of Using Visual Methods to Aid Participation in Educational Research, paper in the symposium 'Mediating encounters: Theory and practice of using visual methods to aid participation in educational research', BERA conference, London, UK,</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96F1629B-1489-4B62-8747-B3F233B84AB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research methodology workshop will address the context of participatory research with CYP and will cover the development of participatory research and associated policies over the decades.

This review has identified the current position of CYP in research into the criminal justice system in the UK, and suggested a model of justification for involving them. The evidence shows that there has been a genuine progression over the last decade in terms of ensuring the participation of CYP. Participatory research would seem an effective way of ensuring CYP can challenge negative perceptions, stimulate change and become visible in a positive manner. Any research involving CYP needs to be clear in its focus and purpose, and provide opportunities for CYP to engage in a meaningful and relevant way, in order that it can enhance their well-being and be mutually beneficial. In this way CYP can become active and empowered citizens in their own communities and beyond. On the basis of the evidence we recommend that researchers examine their motives carefully, work in partnership to share knowledge and skills, and collect evidence from CYP about 'when' it is appropriate to involve young people in research, and 'which' young people.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My PhD thesis (2015) was by publication, and this output was one of my submitted publications.
