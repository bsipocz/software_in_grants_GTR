RESOURCE</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K002457/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The MESH project will provide, and facilitate, new visions of historical space. Based on outstanding documentary and cartographic resources in Edinburgh, the project team will deploy digital technologies to develop new types of historical maps based on social, cultural, political, religious, military, environmental, architectural and economic information. The project will be structured around the emergent themes of the city's spatial evolution, and guided by the operating principles of cartographic projects eg administrative areas, cadastral plans, and jurisdictions. 

The Edinburgh Atlas (E-ATLAS) will provide a new digital atlas of Edinburgh structured around six temporal periods: the early city; medieval city c.1300-1550; the early modern city 1550-1680; Enlightenment Edinburgh, 1680-1820; the 'modern' city, c.1820-1914; the capital city, 1914-2000. The changing nature and structure of the city will form the basis to 30 interpretive essays organised around key themes with analytical emphasis on the processes of change in a spatial context. The E-ATLAS will provide a world-leading innovative intellectual product.

The web-based e-atlas provides an internationally innovative research facility. The emphasis will be on customisable maps based on the NLS' 500 digitised Edinburgh maps. As demonstrated by the highly successful and publicly acclaimed open-source tools piloted by the AHRC-funded Visualising Urban Geographies Knolwedge Transfer Project (PI Rodger) (see Attachments for Impact of VUG) users' historical data will be plotted on historical maps appropriate to the period, and saved in personal accounts accessible either by individuals or groups. This customisable web-based delivery will be suitable for researchers at all levels; it will be available to the general public, and by extending the historical frame will have far reaching consequences for scholars and the public. 

This provision of an e-atlas facility is a central objective based on a key principle of the project: public accessibility and scholarly additionality (and is consistent with the AHRC 2011-15 strategic emphasis on the Digital Economy and Creative Hubs). By facilitating the publication of newly-created maps of Edinburgh on a variety of topics, the project will demonstrate the utility of spatial analysis for different disciplines. It will assist the development of linkages between acadenic and non-academic users. 

The MESH project connects with two other AHRC objectives. First, MESH provides a stimulus to public history by facilitating spatial analysis in a historical setting through the use of user-friendly mapping tools. The project will bring spatial analysis firmly within the grasp of local history societies and voluntary organisations by means of Knowledge Transfer both in a technical environment of web-based mapping, and by providing examples of best practice from experienced historians. Second, the project provides civic authorities, museum curators, and planners with mapping tools (e-atlas) designed which will assist their professional work as they seek to understand the way Scotland's capital evolved. 

Public interest in the MESH project is significant and widespread. Representatives of Edinburgh's World Heritage Trust, City Council, RCAHMS, Edinburgh Central Library, and local historical societies have expressed strong support. Graduate and undergraduate students have much to gain from the spatial approach to historical analysis.' In addition to history and geosciences, scholars in several humanities and social sciences disciplines - divinity, literature, archaeology, architecture, criminology - and in biological sciences have expressed considerable interest in the project.

In sum, MESH will stimulate and provide a new research resource (E-ATLAS); advance research capacity (e-atlas); develop an online research facility; and enhance user engagement and inter-institutional collaboration within and beyond Scotland's capital.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have considerable impact for (i) the general public (ii) the cultural sector of museums and galleries (iii) public sector policy makers, particularly those in local government and (iv) private interests.

(i) General Public. By providing a multi-authored Atlas and a complementary electronic resource with interactive elements, the general public, and local historical societies in particular will be able to explore the historical aspects of their neighbourhoods and communities by generating their own maps on a variety of topics eg population, places of historical interest, architectural features, green space, archaeological sites. This engagement with their locality will enrich communities and contribute to the social capital of the town, village or suburb. Shared community interests have long been favoured by local and central governments as a means of developing place identity and building social responsibility. Websites provide an ideal way of doing this, and the shared knowledge and development of IT skills further contributes to an enrichment of localities. There are active local historical societies throughout the UK who will be beneficiaries. (See Attachments for VUG project outputs and the range of public interests in historical mapping.) 

(ii) Cultural Sector - Museums and Galleries. The ability to create maps will enable curators themselves to build in visual and spatial perspectives to their displays eg the location of objects, distribution of activities. Curators will be less dependent on external skills. Since almost all small towns have rich artefacts but too little labour or resources to present these, the ability to produce maps of their locality, and the historical resources in it, will be a considerable advantage.

(iii) Local Government. Where public consultation exercises are involved MESH's historical maps will provide the context for policy-makers and a useful visual tool for 'active citizenship', as envisaged under the recent Localism Act for English and Welsh communities and the Community Empowerment Action Plan in Scotland. Spatial and historical knowledge embeds the citizen in a particular locality, and so enriches civil society. Identifying and mapping listed buildings, considering planning proposals, developments in conservation areas, and regeneration plans are just a few of the ways in which the MESH tools and approaches will inform local agencies.

MESH also offers the educational sector - schools, FE, HE and U3A - real potential to embed projects more deeply in the locality. Such an awareness forms part of the active citizenship agenda (see above). Historical mapping will achieve this in the short term as pilot studies with Edinburgh University undergraduates have demonstrated. 

A sense of place - or place-attachment as it is sometimes described - and a better sense of the changes to place, is one of the major outputs of the MESH project.

(iv) Private Interests. Knowing the past and being able to represent it spatially assists commerce. For example, building or engineering firms could locate places of environmental contamination from address-based and mapped historical data, and tender for remediation. Mapping specific business types based on Post Office directories could produce work for a firm. The PI has been working with EDINA to develop the JISC funded project to automate such geo-coding. See http://addressinghistory.blogs.edina.ac.uk/

Historical mapping of the type proposed will enhance the skill base of project staff as well as that of citizens, curators and public officials, and employment options expanded accordingly. Spatial awareness will be increased across a wide range of users; and significant knowledge transfer benefits will accrue from the project.

Overall: thematic and address-based historical mapping will contribute to advances in the sense of place-making and place identity. Some benefits would accrue within 3 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>633167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Four video segments explained the nature, extent and objectives of the MESH project to the general public.

1 a mapping methodology that is robust, systematic, consistent, and thus transferable to other places;
2 a set of protocols that others can identify and follow to develop OSM elsewhere;
3 a combination of fieldwork observation, use of historical maps and aerial imagery that develops individual plot boundaries (polygons) throughout the the City and which offers potential for government tax reform;
4 polygons that can be used to identify sets/families of data e.g. listed buildings; sites under construction;
5 potential updateable database of property useful to the City Council;
6 points of interest identified include historical sites, green spaces, playgrounds bicycle racks, etc useful to and used by Community Councils and neighbourhood groups;
7 pedestrian ways through the city;
8 essential data for emergency services eg placement of doors

All of these elements are useful to the partners and the wider public interest. 

The key MESH contributions, however, are 
(i) that historical data can be mapped on the framework of roads, properties and addresses identified and mapped by MESH;

Details of emerging economic and societal impact arising from the award have been evident manly through the investment in OpenStreetMapping in conjunction with analytical spatial tools such as a geocoder that provides a visualisation of concentration or dispersion. Organisations such as the Old Town Association, and the Cockburn Association (Civic Trust) have approached MESH to discover where their memberships are either weak and strong in various localities. This approach to dispersion/concentration was also used to identify whether Nimbyism existed amongst objectors to some highly visible planning proposals in the city. In this sense civil society has been quite sophisticated in attempting to understand where strengths and weaknesses existed in their activities. 

Public bodies have used MESH approaches and findings to improve their own activities. Historic Environment Scotland sought to use MESH mapping and tools to refine their information on listed buildings and other historic sites in Edinburgh. That cooperation continues and will be rolled out more widely in Scotland. Similarly, the National Library of Scotland approached MESH to improve the functionality of some of their online mapping tools, now available on line. 

In many instances, copyright and licensing issues have been the central concern of organisations, including the University of Edinburgh, and members of the MESH project have sought at every stage to maintain the maximum possible openness in all aspects of the project. 'Tutorials' on licensing and copyright have formed elements of MESH workshops, reminding those attending that there are real limitations as materials which in any way are derived from Google or Ordnance Survey sources. A powerpoint slide captured this effectively comparing Google, Ordnance Survey and OpenStreetMap in a grid or table using headings that included (i) type of data (raster/vector) (ii) open licence? (iii) data redistribution (iv) vector quality/accuracy (v) searchability (vi) tools, APIs. Each of the three mapping formats Google/OS/OSM were evaluated on each of the criteria. This was a powerful powerpoint slide and assisted many in the general audiences and user groups, as well as to public bodies.

The use of historical mapping has been very stimulating to the general public, and to local history society members especially. Specialist groups - cyclists and environmentalists for example - have welcomed the opportunity to record aspects of their interests in the OpenStreetMap. Businesses can themselves update their details (website, phone and other contact details, change of ownership, function etc). There is an impatience to be able to access the full functionality of the data, and the tools, most obviously from genealogists. 

In another aspect of the MESH project the development of an image database of Edinburgh drawn from the Facebook 'Lost Edinburgh' site with the permission of the site owners, produced extraordinary insights into localities within Edinburgh and provided a condensed history of the neighbourhoods, sourced from local people. 'Lost Edinburgh' has over 120,000 followers. This initiative provided an antidote to the 'high culture' and exclusivity of some prime city centre sites. The spatial database was another instance of proof of concept, showing that the underlying OSM was essential to the fine grain of locations identified by local respondents. 



2 How the findings from your award are impacting the public, private or third/voluntary sectors, and elsewhere. 
The overall impact is to provide a significant cultural asset. Public, private and third sectors each have an interest in dispersion and concentration. The public's visual sense is highly developed. Materials mapped are easily absorbed, recognised; their significance is often self-evident. The conclusions drawn from a distribution of points, like other pictures, may be worth a 1000 words. At all organisational levels there is a readiness to accept that the map and the points on it provide a powerful basis for analysis and policy, and that this transcends the elitist nature of language and educational attainment. 

The key features of MESH findings and outputs can be summarised as follows: convenient, accurate, detailed, up-to-date, interoperability, re-usable, free and fair. These features treat users as equals. No subscriptions, no steep learning curves, suitable for a multitude of uses and users, OSM and the MESH tools and the coding that underpins them all work in the background. The presumption throughout the project has been for openness - and this impacts favourably on the public. 
Governmental agencies are also becoming more heavily involved as a result. The City Council can no longer deny its Open Data responsibilities and so MESH assists them in delivering it by showing how datasets can be made more user friendly. Similarly, with Historic Environment Scotland, who more readily than most are disposed to making their cultural assets available to the public. MESH programming advice has assisted that process by plotting listed buildings on OSM and comparing this to HES' mapping platform. The disparity convinced HES that a switch to OSM was desirable and MESH and HES are currently cooperating to that end. 

MESH explored licensing issues relating to Post Office Directories with the National Library of Scotland, showed how restrictive this was and, after a two year dialogue, the NLS became more relaxed about the interpretation. So complex MESH programming and laborious data cleaning, both automated and on-scree, has produced searchable Directories and added a path-breaking historical asset which will be available to the public. To search, as is now possible, the 2770 entries in the 1773 street Directory for Edinburgh and map, say, the bakers or widows or lawyers - or all of them together! - in seconds is revolutionary. To do so for 1910 with 36,000 entries is just amazing. To provide a continuous series would provide a level of social, economic, business, administrative and other insights impossible anywhere at the moment. Understanding past urban development has just changed. 

At all levels - public, private and third sector - MESH has worked extremely hard to illustrate the efficiency gains and wider benefits to stakeholders. 


3 Challenges overcome to achieve impact
Institutional rigidities are powerful. The accumulated investment of years of involvement with doing things a particular way is hard to breakdown - even from within the powerful position of a chief executive. Licensing concerns influenced the NLS; funding shortfalls were a convenient cover for the City of Edinburgh Council; and the University of Edinburgh is not exempt either from presenting its buildings, its visitor information and outward facing websites with fixed images of maps of the city. To reverse such institutional fixity was and remains difficult - and to do so within the time frame of an AHRC grant even more so. 

Funding limitations. The project was under-funded. The methodology changed for reasons associated with technical advances to an embrace of OpenStreetMap in the time between proposal and award. This meant a truly massive amount of background work on the part of the MESH Team (a part time PI, a full time technical developer, a full time clerical assistant, and a part time RA quickly casualised with AHRC approval to a series of short term contracts to undertake mapping surveys.) So the outward facing part of the project - diplomacy with the stakeholders such as the City Council, presentations and workshops in the University and in the City; academic presentation locally, nationally and internationally - took a heavy toll. The fact that the AHRC took some 9 months to find a poorly informed third referee for a Follow-on-Fund application and almost 12 months to inform the MESH team that funding was not forthcoming was a difficult blow - and an unfair one as any of our partners, collaborators and colleagues would now agree.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EB49F50E-CCF8-4A44-B9FF-7F1D4CC50036</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd866fd25484.27985696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>MESH has enhanced Open Source elements - OpenStreetMap as delivered by Swedish mapping - and uses Open Source tools, software, and data.

The project has generated immense research capacity as it relates to Edinburgh, and demonstrates, as proof of concept, that this has equivalent potential in other urban settings in the UK and indeed elsewhere. 

Though it has been common to map information according to areas to produce choropleth mapping, the methodology pursued by MESH liberates data from the restrictive boundaries in which it was first collected. That is: the address-based data can be recombined in polygons defined by thte user. The 'natural neighbourhoods' ie the way communities actually function within the larger urban areas can be mapped without reference to the wards, parishes, or other bounded administrative areas.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>58c922d1d01ce0.37382052</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:protection>Protection not required</gtr:protection><gtr:title>OpenStreetMap</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>What were the most significant achievements from the award?
There have been a number of significant achievements. 

1. The completion of OpenStreetMap (OSM) for Edinburgh. 
The map involved the development of the most comprehensive, free to use, city map in the UK, accurate to 1.5 metres (see https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/55.93832/-3.21719 ). This infrastructural research investment provides the key to the mapping precision. 
The process involved:
(i) fieldwork surveys (100,000 buildings, 83,000 addresses, 18,000 road segments and 14,500 points of interest) - over 90% of all such items in Edinburgh. 
(ii) transferring all details to OSM as nodes, lines and polygons of residential property entrances, shops and commercial activities, and other amenities (green space, leisure facilities, historic sites, institutions, etc.). This was achieved in conjunction with out-of-copyright maps (digitised, geo-referenced by the National Library of Scotland), Open Source software (QGIS), and Bing imagery. Over 1 million nodes exist in for the OSM Edinburgh, permitting a fine grain of mapping based on the metadata and tags. 
This enables subtle interrogation of the map using a tool, Turbo Overpass, supplied in association with OSM and enabling hundreds of data points to be identified in seconds. It is therefore possible to search for, say, all pharmacies, or all pharmacies with evening opening hours. 

2. Boundaries. 
Developing a suite of bounded areas (parishes, wards, registration districts, city limits, constituencies, sanitary districts, etc.) consistent with various administrative units was central to the collection and analysis of historical data. 'Edinburgh' itself meant different things at different times and the MESH team considered many Edinburghs from geological time to the Roman to the medieval and to early modern and through to the contemporary. These boundaries were also drawn on the OSM, as were known lines such as the Town Walls, ceremonial routes e.g. Ridings, and the core road network. 
This forensic historical analysis when combined with detailed mapping has revealed much about the functioning of the burgh. Archaeological excavations, documentary texts, and data mining of contemporary materials have in every period provided new facets to understand spatial, functional and organisational aspects of the town and city. Most importantly, the identification of administrative boundaries is a significant achievement and durable legacy of the MESH project. Like the development of a spatial framework the investment in research capacity has significance for users elsewhere. 

3. Open Source tools: Geocoder
With a mapping framework and boundaries in place, the analysis of historical (and contemporary) data is facilitated by OpenSource tools developed by MESH, most notably a Geocoder. That is, behind the scenes is a powerful engine to process hundreds, even thousands, of data items and map them in seconds. This is a key development. It liberates historians and others from the tyranny of the proprietary provider, always subjected to their terms and conditions, and specifically with Google, where licensing and copyright are restrictive. 
To oversimplify: a spreadsheet file (Excel) can be selected from a list of files, just as a user would with an e mail attachment, and the instruction then given to 'map the data'. To work best, the spreadsheet should be 'clean' i.e. the addresses rendered in a standardised format. This is exactly what was sought at the proposal stage of the MESH project. Once 'cleaned' the results are immediate - and accurate, because the mapping is. Even where streets are renamed or houses renumbered a glossary of streets is used to point the geocoder to the appropriate data. In addition, because the historical maps are geo-referenced the geocoder tool can be used to obtain latitude and longitude by automatically clicking on a site and inserting the coordinates in a spreadsheet. Thus textual materials can be geocoded so long as they reveal the approximate position, for example, 'opposite the Tolbooth'; 'at the head of the close', etc. This provides a spatial dimension before street numbering was common i.e. before c.1790.

4. Data Model: Post Office Directories
A highly significant achievement, both technical and in terms historical understanding, has been to develop Open Source code and a data model that automates the searching and cleaning of Post Office Directories - perhaps one of the most important sources of address, occupational and related historical data. In Edinburgh there are 180 volumes which run from 1773-1963 with very few gaps. There are 2770 entries in 1773; 36,000 entries in 1910. Once cleaned, the data matching links one Directory to the one for the next year. All the women, or all the 'esquires' or and occupational group can be identified, linked to an address which has been manually georeferenced, and mapped. This is a finding that should be developed further. 

5. Knowledge Exchange and Public Engagement
Public bodies and private individuals have increasingly recognised the MESH contributions to spatial analysis. Lothian Buses, some City Council departments (e.g Planning), Historic Environment Scotland; Visit Scotland; National Library of Scotland; Scottish Government (statistics); Police Scotland; community organisations e.g. Greener Leith. The MESH produced OpenStreetMap underpins the APP maps.me widely used by tourists. MESH assists public bodies to meet at least two empowerment agendas: 
(i) engaging citizens and local communities (ii) open data. 
MESH mapping also provides businesses with a location that includes a url, phone number, website and an immediate presence in the market. These are highly significant, and according to the Danish government, open addresses delivers significant net gain when a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. [See Danish Enterprise and Construction Authority, The Value of Danish Address Data, 2010] Using this Danish data the net benefit to the Edinburgh economy is at least &amp;pound;350,000 per annum. 
As the number of presentations and workshops show, MESH has had a very wide exposure with the general public. Over 2100 individuals have attended almost 50 events which MESH has either organised or attended. The responses have been invariably positive. 

To what extent were the award objectives met? 
The award objectives were exceeded. The extent of engagement and the changing institutional culture towards OpenData, though conservative, helped MESH to achieve the project objectives. MESH itself contributed to this process, taking part in Open Knowledge events and promoting OpenStreetMap locally, nationally and internationally. Efficiency gains have been demonstrated to organisations and a way forward charted. The fact that so many national institutions such as Historic Environment Scotland and the National Library of Scotland have embraced the potential identified by MESH, and that tourists and the public use the contemporary maps through the maps.me APP shows is in no small part due to MESH initiatives, demonstrations and meetings with officials in these organisations. 

How might the findings be taken forward and by whom?
There are a number of follow-on possibilities. Three of the most important are identified below. 
1. The methodology and symbology of OSM has been clearly demonstrated to be robust on a city-wide scale. This should now be extended to selected smaller places - geographically dispersed to generate local interest. The choices might be Elgin, Galashiels and Ayr to represent north, south and west of Scotland. Leadership would include community participation and crowd-sourcing managed and coordinated by a technical officer very familiar with the standards and processes established by MESH. Arguably other Scottish agencies might become more involved too - Historic Environment Scotland have as good as said so. 
There is no reason why this could not be rolled out in English boroughs, too, though there is momentum in Scotland through the MESH project and that will facilitate community engagement and successful delivery.

2. The Post Office Directories has two potential developmental stages: (i) to complete the cleaning of the Edinburgh PO Directories and to apply the data model established by MESH to do that; (ii) to apply the data matching and cleaning model to some of the 400+ Directories in the rest of Scotland. To achieve (i) would be to add arguably the greatest single historical data source by a non-governmental institution that readily comes to mind, and would do so in a searchable - and because of MESH's linkage of address to maps - and mappable form. To achieve (ii) would offer a very important corrective to the scholarship that relies on data garnered from large places and would bring generate the kind of administrative and business benefits identified by the Danish Government (see above) since OpenStreetMap be developed in parallel with the local Directories. 

3. 3D modelling of Edinburgh has been an important, unexpected spin-off from MESH. Because the OSM provides boundaries of properties it is possible to generate a 3D simulation of the entire city. There is no UK equivalent. Some enhancements are required and these would provide improved functionality. It is likely that the computer gaming industry would derive benefits from this, and because of the transferability of Open Source code, tools and mapping this would increase interest in other UK places if and when OSM is extended in the same level of detail as in Edinburgh.

The Post Office Directories has two potential developmental stages: (i) to complete the cleaning of the Edinburgh PO Directories and to apply the data model established by MESH to do that; (ii) to apply the data matching and cleaning model to some of the 400+ Directories in the rest of Scotland. To achieve (i) would be to add arguably the greatest single historical data source by a non-governmental institution that readily comes to mind, and would do so in a searchable - and because of MESH's linkage of address to maps - and mappable form. To achieve (ii) would offer a very important corrective to the scholarship that relies on data garnered from large places and would bring generate the kind of administrative and business benefits identified by the Danish Government (see above) since OpenStreetMap be developed in parallel with the local Directories. 

3. 3D modelling of Edinburgh has been an important, unexpected spin-off from MESH. Because the OSM provides boundaries of properties it is possible to generate a 3D simulation of the entire city. There is no UK equivalent. Some enhancements are required and these would provide improved functionality. It is likely that the computer gaming industry would derive benefits from this, and because of the transferability of Open Source code, tools and mapping this would increase interest in other UK places if and when OSM is extended in the same level of detail as in Edinburgh.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Already there are many known uses of MESH findings and products. There are many more and a selection of those developed or under consideration provides some indication of future potential. 

1. Emergency services. Exact location of entrances to buildings and up-to-date map of the city - updated overnight, unlike Ordnance survey (twice per year);
2. Emergency services. Location of defibrillators; lifebelts etc. 
3. Public engagement: fault reporting to Edinburgh City Council. Using OSM, public are more actively involved in identifiying defects in services (lighting, potholes etc); also improves dialogue with City Council and sense of responsiveness. City Council can use OSM to inform public online and with a map of forthcoming developments - planning, traffic disruption etc;
4. City Council can achieve administrative efficiencies - all departments using a single spatial database rather than the multitude of maps and datasets asat the moment;
5. City Council can involve public by issuing data as spreadsheets rather than as pdf files. Public can therefore be more engaged in civil society;
6. Strengthening civil society. Clubs, societies and organisations can map memberships, identify gaps, and recruit;
7. Supporting business performance. SMEs able to map debtor, suppliers, customers and identify gaps, weaknesses, strategies without incurring expenses of an Ordnance survey subscription; 
8. Educational contribution: raising awareness of spatial dimension for school children by making mapping available on smart phones;
9. Educational contribution: developing materials for geography, urban studies and similar courses using maps, and physical features; 
10. Dynamic mapping: for wayfinding, features, historic sites, leisure interests. Google known to identify only the most popular features and this discriminates against minority interests, small businesses, by focussing attention on places with the most hits. The OSM turbo pass wizard provides ALL of the restaurants, all ofthe chemists and thus improves consumer convenience and choice. 
11. Environmental protection: use Directories to discover where chemical and other contaminants have existed; 
12. Redefine boundaries: at present wards, educational districts and a number of other adminstrative areas are defined for the colection of data and public administration. However 'natural neighbourhoods' can be developed using OSM because addresses can be combined in user-defined ways. Often a major thoroughfare is a boundary but actually both sides of the road constitutes the same neighbourhood;
13. Tourists find the OSM very helpful, and this could be improved by better publicity by visitor and information offices pointing tourists to the dynamic mapping available in OSM; 
14. Planning applications can be idenitifed in the immediate area surrounding a person;s home, say within 500 metres, to show all live applications. Thi would engage with the public and reduce the sense of disempowerment over planning developments; 
14. Community Councils: as the unit of local government funding becoes further eroded Community Councils can use mapping and citizen engagement to respond to the needs of their area. 
15. Maintenance: the City Council in conjunction with the OpenStreetMap community need to forge a partnership to maintain the accuracy and currnecy of OSM. This is a substantial asset, and one that achieves most when maintained. 

These are a selection of ways in which the MESH products and findings can be take forward. Some already are, but an improved public and business engagement with spatial issues would deliver efficiency gains and qualitative improvements to inhabitants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52F93F16-22D4-4B9F-B86A-4346141B93C3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd820665a2b8.00167235</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Practical Archaeology:</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E9DB50C4-A1D1-4569-99A4-0DFA6454EBE7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9658e7445b5.33147398</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Practical Arcahology MSc students University of Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AABFB7F0-6915-476F-A1CA-7171BF9C4AD7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c965d5a79cb1.96557809</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Informing the Public</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2CD43C5F-8CF7-4767-B7B6-35CFCCEC60D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Examples:

So the collection of these bounded areas is critical and MESH team members have laboured to obtain these from texts, historical maps and other sources.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6AABFB1A-CD37-445B-AF3C-150F5088AEF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The result of the work to develop boundaries defining of adminstrative control has produced new perpsectives on urban development, and the work relating to the early modern period (specifically 16th and 17th centuries) has resulted in re-visiting and reivising the history of Edinburgh.

They decayed somewhat in the late 1950s and by 1963 were only partial as telephone books superceded them. 

Historical Directories are full of valuable information: name; address; gender; marital status (women) and other status eg sir, esquire etc; occupation/s; address businesses; professional qualifications; telephone and telegarm numbers, and a variety of miscellaneous information. 

These one or two columned pages have a fairly standard, but not entirely consistent format, either internally or between volumes, and raster images produced resulting from a Libararies project spearheaded by the National Library of Scotland are not suited to interrogation. 

The MESH data model involves:
-converting the raster images to text images;
-using bounding boxes to identify page /column widths;
-separating individual entries;
-cleaning for consistency, removing noise such as blemishes on the page; 
-identifying discrete fields - not all entries have all fields; 
-dealing with old typographic conventions ie 'f' in place of 's' where there are 2 'ss' ie 'drefses' where it should be 'dresses' - and other idiosyncracies;
-identifying defunct street names;
-cleaning the entries to render names and other details consistent; part automated, part manual 

Writing code to achieve a data model for automated extraction of Directory entries is a major advance.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C8F25D02-79C7-41B9-8B98-100C4A7C0C35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results have been impresive, as presented to professional practitioners and users generally. For example, the 1773-74 Directory (2770 entries) can be searched for any occupation and be mapped in seconds. All women, all married women, all bakers, all titled gentlemen - indeed a variety of several variables can be mapped by this means. 

The productivity, accuracy, speed suggests entirely new ways of interrogating directories and of informing historical analysis and understanding as a result. 
The data model and delivery of associated mapping has been described as 'world leading' and MESH has had a remarkable success in this arena. 

It is to be expected that genealogists will be particularly interested in this development.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3749959537.52655566acb898</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Data model and matching: Directories</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This takes two forms:

These datasets form the basis of the Atlas of Edinburgh - both hard and e copies - and illustrate innovative approaches to understanding space and spatial relationships. The provenance of the data is acknowledged, and meta data recorded.

The project could not rely on any other providers eg City Council since they were locked into licensing and copyright arrangements with the Ordnance Survey.

Some Geocoders eg Google can only handle a few data points (about 150) and/or limit the number of passes per day. 

the MESH geocoder probably has limits but testing has shown it can handle thousands of Edinburgh addresses in seconds, and do so at the level of the individual property since the mapping undertaken by the MESH team is accurate to within 1.5 metres, and because house numbers have been assigned individually to properties.</gtr:description><gtr:id>24C75C00-6D04-4DEE-B64E-DC22E51FDF17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The capacity to accurately locate data points spatially is a powerful research tool.
