Now that architects and engineers are seeking to use this material on an ever-larger scale, it is necessary to quantify the relevant hazards, and take steps to mitigate the potential risks.

The external flame from a fire is the key parameter that effect the potential for vertical and horizontal fire spread. The characteristics of this flame are controlled by the excess fuel factor. It is known that where timber linings are provided in a compartment, the excess fuel factor can be substantially affected. This research project will quantify the impact of timber linings on the excess fuel factors, and then conduct a parametric study to investigate how this affects the heat to adjacent areas, and upper levels of a building.

Specifically, a series of fire tests will be conducted that will measure the burning behaviour within a medium-scale room (of the order of 1m) - these tests will be used to quantify the excess fuel factor for a range of conditions. An experimental compartment with propane burners will be used to conduct a highly repeatable parametric study of the heat flux that results from different excess fuel factors.

The project will conclude with a series of workshops (in association with BRE and the Standing Committee on Structural Safety) to disseminate the findings to a wide industry audience. The work will lead to guidance for engineers and regulators to help them decide how best to prevent fire spread between buildings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key beneficiaries of the research will be the community stakeholders associated to the proliferation of mass timber construction. These include:
 - Building owners and occupiers. The threat posed by fire spread is substantial, and reducing this threat will improve the safety of new apartment buildings, and prevent a fire in one building damaging adjacent properties.
 - Fire services. Spreading fires represent a significant challenge to their operational fire-fighting techniques.
 - Timber producing industry. Reducing the impact of fires and enabling the more widespread use of timber products within the construction industry.

The research will benefit the community of design professionals who are responsible for designing resilient cities (i.e. architects, engineers, and associated regulators). These groups will be able to access the research to ensure that their proposed developments are not at excessive risk of fire spread.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R012296/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0F0B5443-BE5E-4DB6-823E-B7E33EE35922</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil Engineering Materials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>153EEBDB-0E76-4210-9687-2E4C43AE8DFF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
