'Ethics committees' and the like are a growth industry in many walks of life. This is especially true in the militaries of the Western world, where question of ethics are acquiring a new significance as the work of the armed forces is held up to public scrutiny by the press in the course of the 'War on Terror'. Stories of prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, allegations of use of illegal weapons and disproportionate violence, and revelations in the UK about 'hazing' practices in military training, have all raised the issue of military ethics to public prominence. The requirement for soldiers, sailors and air force personnel to behave in a manner deemed moral by the general public has never been clearer.


However, until recently, ethics training policies in the military appear to have been developed on an ad hoc basis, with tittle in the way of consistently applied underpinnings drawn from ethical theory, or of attempts to embed moral norms, principles and standards within a pragmatic, workable training programme. This has now begun to change, with the establishment in many countries of new military ethics programmes which directly involve and draw on the work of academic philosophers and social scientists. Yet despite the commonality of problems and aims of the armed forces of the countries involved, these programmes have been developed in isolation from one another, and often on the basis of very different philosophical principles and methods. The honor code of the US Military Academy West Point, for instance, is a clear example of rule-based ethics, whereas the Canadian Forces have chosen to pursue a values-based ethics programme.


By holding two workshops devoted to the theme of 'Ethics Training and Development in the Military', the Institute of Applied Ethics at the University of Hull aims to carry out the first academic survey of the work being carried out in this area. 
The workshops will bring together philosophers, ethicists, military officers (including chaplains), and social scientists from across the globe, to conduct an inter-disciplinary analysis of the ethics training and development schemes currently in place within the armed forces of many countries. 
They will conduct a critical comparison and evaluation of the codes and training programmes (both formal and informal) that are currently implemented in a wide cross-section of military staff colleges and academies from across the world. In the process, they will determine the philosophical principles and methods on which those programmes are based, discuss the reasons why those principles have been selected, and determine, as far as is possible, their suitability and effectiveness. 
Through the exchange of ideas and experience, they will apply their knowledge and expertise towards determining to what extent it is possible to produce a commonly accepted basis for military ethics training and development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10863</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D504147/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
