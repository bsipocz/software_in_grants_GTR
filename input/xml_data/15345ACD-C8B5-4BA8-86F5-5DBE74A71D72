Skills Hub in Quantum Systems Engineering: Imperial Centre for Quantum Engineering &amp;amp; Science</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Training Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/P510257/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Over the last few decades our ability to exploit subtle quantum effects has advanced remarkably, and this in turn has fuelled the UK's new initiatives to pursue revolutionising quantum based technologies. Responding to this demand, Imperial College proposes to establish an inter-faculty Centre for Quantum Engineering and Science to lead interdisciplinary education and research activities for applications of quantum technology. Repeating the successes of the laser and transistor will rely on the cooperation of a diverse range of expertise, spanning quantum scientists, engineers, industry, designers and business leaders, who can not only work together to realise viable new technologies, but train the next generation of leaders. These new quantum engineers will overcome the hurdles of bringing laboratory proofs of principle to the market. Imperial's vision is to play a leading role in realising this endeavour. We have been successfully running the Centre for Doctoral Training in Controlled Quantum Dynamics for the last seven years, as well as the recent Innovative Doctoral Programme in Frontiers in Quantum Technology. The current proposal will take the College's vision a step further, aligning with these initiatives and bridging the gap between academic research, industry and the marketplace. Our Hub will train quantum engineers with a skillset to understand cutting-edge quantum research, a mindset toward developing this innovation, and the entrepreneurial skills to lead the market. Under this training and skills hub call, a coherent training and research programme will be provided to engineering and physical science graduates, with the express aim of bringing them to the forefront of quantum technology innovation and entrepreneurship. As such, it will be the engineering and physical science faculties at Imperial that will be providing the training. The programme is to be composed of a one-year master's course followed by three years of PhD research. The students will follow intensive coursework on quantum technology, systems engineering, photonics technology, and innovations &amp;amp; entrepreneurship in the first six months of the master's year, after which a six-month project will normally lead into a longer PhD project. Considering varied backgrounds of the students, extensive remedial courses on fundamental concepts will be provided at the start, followed by continued tutorial assistance. We will work closely with other national centres of excellence in order to expand the national capability. The research topics at the Hub includes: 1) Development of quantum technologies including inertial navigation systems, quantum simulators, quantum sensors and components for quantum networks, 2) Development of rugged and compact devices to enable quantum technology, 3) Fabrication and packaging, 4) Bridging conventional and quantum technologies and 5) new applications of quantum engineering. A high percentage of our researchers will be involved in collaboration with UK institutes, including industry partners and quantum technology hubs. At the same time, we will expand upon our established practices to serve as a national resource, encouraging collaboration and mobility between quantum researchers and engineers in the UK. We will provide national training and industry networking programmes, support training for visiting researchers and establish a career development fund to promote research innovation and entrepreneurialism. They will also be exposed to taylor-made entrepreneurship and innovation courses, through an intensive programme provided by the Imperial College Business School. Students in our Hub will benefit from compulsory placement opportunities across our industry partners and the UK quantum technology network. Finally, cohort building will be taken very seriously. This is an area where we have developed significant expertise.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact of the proposed Hub will be in training quantum engineers with a skillset to understand cutting-edge quantum research and a mindset toward developing this innovation, and the entrepreneurial skills to lead the market. This will grow the UK capacity in quantum technology. Through our programme, we nurture the best possible work force who can start new business in quantum technology. Our programme will provide multi-level skills training in quantum engineering in order to enhance the UK quantum technologies landscape at several stages. Through the training we will produce quantum engineers with training in innovation and entrepreneurship who will go into industry or quantum technology research positions with an understanding of innovation in quantum technology, and will bridge the gap between the quantum physicist and the classical engineer to accelerate quantum technology research and development. Our graduates will have to be entrepreneurial to start new business in quantum technology. By providing late-stage training for current researchers and engineers in industry, we will enhance the current landscape of the quantum technology industry. After the initial training composed of advanced course works, placements and short projects, our students will act as a catalyzer for collaboration among quantum technology researchers, which will accelerate the development of quantum technology in the UK. Our model actively encourages collaboration and partnerships between Imperial and national quantum tehcnology centres and we will continue to maintain the strong ties we have developed through the Centre for Doctoral Training in order to enhance our on-going training provisions. The Hub will also have an emphasis on industrial involvement. Through our new partnerships students will be exposed to a broad spectrum of non-academic research opportunities. An important impact of the Hub is in the research performed by the young researchers, PhD students and junior fellows. They will greatly enhance the research capacity in quantum technology. Imperial College has many leading engineers and quantum scientists. One of the important outcomes we expect through this Hub programme is for these academics to work together to translate the revolutionary ideas in quantum science to engineering and the market place. We also aim to influence industry and policy makers through our outreach programme in order to improve their awareness of this disruptive technology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3044614</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P510257/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
