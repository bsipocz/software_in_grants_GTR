Yet part of what makes strategic interactions interesting is players' limited, often asymmetric rationality.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The objective of this project is to formulate a general game-theoretic model that accommodates many forms of limited strategic sophistication. This framework extends the conventional model of games with incomplete information due to Harsanyi (1967-8), by enriching the notion of a player?s ?type? to include the way she systematically distorts her strategic beliefs. This model will be applied to economic environments such as speculative trade in asset markets, monopoly pricing or monetary policy, where some of the agents have limited ability to draw strategic inferences.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If successful, the project may give a major boost to theoretical work on strategic interactions between players with diverse strategic sophistication. As such, the project has the potential to transform game theory and it applications in economics and other social sciences.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I hope to publish the research outputs as papers in top-five and top-field economics journals, thereby maximizing the papers' visibility and impact among the community of economic theorists.

If this project is successful, I am likely to be able to give invited lectures in large international congresses (as I have been able to do with my previous large-scale research project, on bounded rationality and industrial organization), thereby increasing the project's visibility and convincing other researchers, including more applied ones, that it is worthwhile pursuing it further.

In the longer run (after the end of the grant's 18-month period), if the collection of research papers is successful, I plan to write a monograph about the subject that will be pedagogically useful in that it will contain both the standard model of Bayesian games (the current textbook treatments of which are quite outdated by now) and the novel framework of games between diversely sophisticated players. This will maximize the impact of this project because it will make it accessible to teachers of basic graduate-level game theory courses, and it will demonstrate how the new theoretical framework connects with the familiar one of Bayesian games.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196779</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project's output consists of two research papers that were published (or accepted for publication) in top-five economics journals. The project is theoretical and highly foundational in nature (in accordance with the grant's &amp;quot;transformative social science&amp;quot; theme). Therefore - while I consider the project's outcome highly successful academically - it is unlikely to have broader impact outside the relevant research community in the near future.</gtr:description><gtr:id>85337BFA-E5A8-4C73-9D3D-593C7918D05E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54509a208646f8.29468064</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My objective in this project was to develop a formal representation of &amp;quot;non-rational expectations&amp;quot;, which would unify in a useful manner a large class of equilibrium models in economics in which decision makers' beliefs are systematic distortions of prevailing statistical regularities. This objective has been successfully met. Indeed, the final outcome surpassed my initial expectations. I discovered that the formalism of Bayesian networks, which is widely practiced in statistics and artificial intelligence, can provide such a representation. In the decision model I developed, individual agents are characterized by a directed acyclic graph over the set of relevant variables. The agent's subjective belief distorts the objective probability distribution by factorizing it according to the graph, via the standard Bayesian-network factorization formula. I demonstrated that this representation subsumes many existing models of non-rational expectations as special cases, as well as systematic belief distortions that had not been modeled before, such as reversing the direction of causal relations. Applying basic results in the Bayesian-network literature, I was able to prove general characterizations of individual behavior in this model - for example, conditions on the agent's graph for which individual behavior exhibits fundamental equilibrium properties. Finally, my objective to derive the representation from a model of naive extrapolation from limited learning feedback was successfully met. The findings are reported in two papers, &amp;quot;Bayesian Networks and Boundedly Rational Expectations&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bayesian Networks and Missing-Data Imputation&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The formalism is extremely fruitful and rich in possibilities for future development by pure and applied economic theorists. First, it provides a language for many economic applications, some of which I am planning to undertake myself (e.g., monetary policy when private-sector expectations are non-rational and have a Bayesian-network representation). Second, the representation can be incorporated into game theory and lead to new insights regarding strategic behavior by boundedly rational players. Finally, my &amp;quot;imputation&amp;quot; paper provides a bluprint for similar exercises that derive representations of non-rational expectations as outcomes of extrapolation from limited learning feedback.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E496EA6D-7282-4A62-8905-69ADACA46341</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545099c7ecc964.01338471</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.tau.ac.il/~rani</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5E3CA50F-896A-4586-917F-E7267E889573</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Data Monkeys&amp;quot;: A Procedural Model of Extrapolation from Partial Statistics*</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Review of Economic Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2e43de08261578509a341cb2030bf8e5"><gtr:id>2e43de08261578509a341cb2030bf8e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spiegler R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54e21edb5bd261.83317054</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C043E566-9011-4F11-A349-8E18F3D737E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bayesian Networks and Boundedly Rational Expectations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2e43de08261578509a341cb2030bf8e5"><gtr:id>2e43de08261578509a341cb2030bf8e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spiegler R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>-</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54494568c39356.57002463</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L003031/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A36F8AC7-A076-413A-9213-67F279FDDEA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microeconomic theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
