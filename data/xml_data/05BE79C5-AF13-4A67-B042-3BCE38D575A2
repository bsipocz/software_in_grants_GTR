We are born with only a few tens of thousands of these hair cells in each ear and they do not regenerate: they can die through ageing, exposure to loud noise, and after treatment with some antibiotics and chemotherapy drugs. Although mammalian hair cells do not regenerate, hair cells in birds, amphibians and fish can, so there is a great deal of interest in understanding the development and regeneration of hair cells in these species. 

In fish and amphibians, hair cells are found not just inside the inner ear as in mammals, but also on the body surface, collected in tiny sense organs called neuromasts, which are arranged in characteristic lines over the head and body. These &amp;quot;lateral line&amp;quot; hair cells are just like the ones found in the inner ear, but detect local water flow around the animal (rather than fluid flow within the inner ear). The information is used for finding prey and detecting predators, and contributes to e.g. schooling behaviour. 

Lateral line hair cells develop embryonically from &amp;quot;lateral line placodes&amp;quot;: patches of thickened skin on the head. In zebrafish, the model for almost all research on lateral line hair cell development and regeneration, lateral line placodes migrate in lines over the head and trunk, depositing mechanosensory organs in their wake. However, focusing on a single species potentially limits our understanding of how the development of lateral line hair cells is controlled, both because zebrafish may have evolved some species-specific peculiarities, and because this species, like most such modern &amp;quot;teleost&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;bony&amp;quot;) fish (and also frogs, the other commonly used aquatic vertebrate lab model), is missing an entire second set of lateral line organs present in most other aquatic vertebrate groups: ampullary organs, which contain electroreceptors that detect the weak electric fields that surround animals in water. Electroreception, a true &amp;quot;sixth sense&amp;quot;, is used for finding prey (for example, a shark can detect a flounder buried in the sand by virtue of the weak electric field surrounding it), for orientation (e.g. for long distance migration relative to the earth's magnetic field) and, in some species, for communication. In species with ampullary organs as well as neuromasts, like sharks, &amp;quot;primitive&amp;quot; bony fishes like sturgeons, and aquatic salamanders such as the axolotl, both types of sense organ form from lateral line placodes that elongate (as opposed to migrate) over the head to form ridges, which eventually fragment, with neuromasts forming in the centre of each ridge and ampullary organs forming on the flanks.

The experiments in this grant proposal are aimed at understanding the genes important for the formation of hair cells versus electroreceptors, using the sterlet (a sturgeon) as the model system, from which we can obtain thousands of embryos each year. The fresh perspectives gained through this approach will give us a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying hair cell development and vertebrate sensory cell type diversification.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Inner ear hair cells do not regenerate in mammals. In fishes and amphibians, hair cells are also found in lateral line (LL) neuromasts. In electroreceptive species like chondrosteans (paddlefishes, sturgeons), LL placodes also form electroreceptors (modified hair cells). Zebrafish, the main LL model, lacks electroreceptors. 

OVERALL AIMS: Investigate the transcription factor hierarchies underlying LL sensory cell type diversification, and develop the sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus, a sturgeon) as an alternative ray-finned fish model to the zebrafish, building on a LL-enriched gene-set from paddlefish embryos. The key hair cell transcription factor gene Atoh1 is also expressed in paddlefish electroreceptors, but a short spawning season limits experiments, while sterlet embryos are available for several months annually. 

OBJECTIVES:
1. Identify candidate transcription factor genes for functional analysis:
(a) Assemble a sterlet embryo transcriptome to enable gene-specific primer design for cloning and thus preparation of riboprobes for in situ hybridisation (ISH).
(b) Validate expression of candidate LL-enriched transcription factor genes in sterlet hair cells and/or electroreceptors by ISH, after a PCR screen on LL-enriched paddlefish operculum cDNA to weed out false positives. 
2. Test the role of Atoh1 and other validated transcription factors in hair cell vs. electroreceptor development, and generate transcription factor hierarchies, using CRISPR/Cas9 (which efficiently generates biallelic mutations in F0 injected embryos) in sterlet.

This work will identify transcription factors downstream of Atoh1 in hair cells vs. electroreceptors, and generate the first transcription factor hierarchies in hair cells vs. electroreceptors, yielding new insights into the control of sensory cell type diversification. Developing the sterlet as an alternative ray-finned fish model will complement zebrafish work and identify conserved vs. lineage-specific mechanisms.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of the proposed research are expected to include: 

BUSINESSES RECRUITING GRADUATE-LEVEL STAFF
As well as the impact on PDRA training of learning next-generation sequencing data assembly and analysis techniques, and optimising CRISPR/Cas9 somatic genome-editing and associated analysis techniques in the sterlet, the project will also provide transferable skills in project management, networking, team-working, and written and verbal communication. Such skills would be valuable preparation for employment in both the private and public sectors. Former lab members have gone on to careers in the pharmaceutical industry, consulting and medicine, as well as academia.

THE PUBLIC SECTOR
The embryonic lateral line placodes of the sterlet form mechanosensory hair cells in the skin that are just like those in the inner ear, as well as electroreceptors that detect the weak electric fields that surround living animals in water. Given the strong public appeal of electroreception as a &amp;quot;sixth sense&amp;quot; (see next section), our research could form the basis of new displays at natural history/zoology museums and aquaria: the PI knows James Hanken, Director of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (Cambridge, MA, USA), and Mark Martindale, Director of the University of Florida's Whitney Lab for Marine Bioscience (St. Augustine, FL, USA), and also has contacts at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA, USA) and Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station near the Monterey Bay Aquarium (Pacific Grove, CA, USA). 

THE GENERAL PUBLIC &amp;amp; SCHOOLS
The existence of a &amp;quot;sixth sense&amp;quot;, electroreception, used by sharks, rays, chondrostean fishes (paddlefishes and sturgeons), salamanders and weakly electric fishes to hunt live prey and even communicate, has great public appeal, hence the potential to stimulate increased public awareness and understanding of science. This is evident from popular media interest in our work showing that lateral line placodes in the paddlefish give rise to electroreceptors as well as neuromasts (Modrell et al., 2011, Nat. Commun. 2: 496), and hence that the common ancestor of bony fishes (including humans) had a lateral line placode-derived system of electroreceptors and mechanosensory hair cells: this was featured by the Daily Mail online (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2048216/Humans-descended-animal-sixth-sense.html); by Science &amp;amp; Vie (the French equivalent of New Scientist: No. 1132, Jan. 2012 edition, pp. 10-11); and by the weekly science supplement for To Vima, a leading Greek newspaper (print edition 25/12/11; http://www.tovima.gr/science/article/?aid=436005), as well as receiving online coverage from ScienceDaily.com, Futura-Sciences and other websites. Similarly, Discovery Channel news (http://news.discovery.com/animals/sharks-humans-common-ancestor-120816.html) and the NBC News website (http://www.nbcnews.com/id/48691443) featured our work showing that electroreceptors in skates are also lateral line placode-derived (Gillis et al., 2012, Development 139: 3142-6), hence that the ancestor of all jawed vertebrates had a lateral line placode-derived system of electroreceptors and mechanosensory hair cells. The PI is experienced in delivering talks to the lay public and schoolchildren, and her lab members presented a popular display during Cambridge Science Week's &amp;quot;Science on Saturday&amp;quot;, as well as becoming involved in researcher visits during the school holidays at the recently opened Cambridge Science Centre. The PI's lab is a registered project provider for the Nuffield Science Bursaries for Schools and Colleges, enabling interested Year 12 (lower sixth) pupils to spend 4-6 weeks over the summer in her lab, working on projects related to this or other lab projects. Bursary students learn about their own research project area in depth, gain valuable experience of working in a research lab, and, often for the first time, realise that science can be a career.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>351052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P001947/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9898EFC8-73AB-4E1E-A207-04A486D9F1A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal developmental biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
