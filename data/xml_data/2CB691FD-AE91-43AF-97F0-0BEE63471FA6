surface treatment to improve performance for example with respect to wear or lubrication or biocompatibility or electronic
properties. These surface coatings are often be extremely thin, being less than the diameter of a human hair. The goal of
this project is to develop an innovative model of a manufacturing process that applies thin film coatings to complex
engineering components using one of the processes known as physical vapour deposition. This is carried out in large
'vacuum vessels' at low pressure and the coating is created by creating a shower of atoms dislodged from a target surface
onto the engineering substrate. The specific process investigated here is called sputtering and it uses energetic charged
particles to bombard the target. With applications across the engineering sector advanced coatings &amp;amp; surface engineering
is worth more than &amp;pound;10.8B in direct UK turnover. Surface engineering as a whole, supports UK products worth around
&amp;pound;144B.
At the heart of the sputtering process is an ionized gas or plasma. This electrically conducting medium provides the selfsustaining
environment that transfers atoms of a target material and onto the chosen substrate. Targets are expensive and
target utilization is an issue. So we need a way to design a sputtering process for any given engineering component that
can be done in software avoiding the expense and delay of modifying equipment and coatings by trial and error. We plan
to develop a design tool that can be implemented in numerical simulation software running on a desktop computer in a
pragmatic time for design usage. It will accurately predict coating quality, distribution &amp;amp; target wear in complex industrial
coating equipment treating relevant, 3-D high value components. This numerical approach combines finite element &amp;amp; ray
tracing methods, producing a self-consistent multi-psics model for magnetic &amp;amp; electric fields, plasma &amp;amp; surface physics. It
takes into account the atomistic aspects of the plasma and surface (sputtering) processes within the macroscopic model.
Our contribution to this project is in the form of laboratory expertise and knowledge about low pressure non-equilibrium
plasmas. This will be combined with the modelling expertise of Cobham, the coating expertise of Teer Coatings Ltd and
needs of the surface engineering sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our contribution to this project is in the form of laboratory expertise and knowledge about low pressure non-equilibriumplasmas.

Sophisticated modelling is computationally expensive and this project has been exploring the extent to which faster modelling can be achieved. Our specific role has been in providing experimental measurements to benchmark the modelling. In particular we have been measuring charged particle density (hairpin probe), magnetic field distribution (Hall probe), spatial distribution of species in the sputtering environment (OES imaging) and the fluxes and energy of sputtered species (LIF).

We have identified important interactions between the magnetic field at the surface of a magnetron sputtering target and the energetic of the sputtered species. These are being prepared for publication in an article likely to be entitled &amp;quot;Influence of local magnetic field on fluxes and thermalisation of sputtered species in a DC magnetron&amp;quot;. An intersting low current DC magnetron mode has also been explored. This will be reported under the title &amp;quot;Apparent low current (DC) magnetron mode with high relative sputter yield&amp;quot; - it revelas an unstable low power regime in which the plasm flips between a state with a high cathode voltage with significant sputtering of electrode materila into the vapour phase and a lower ambient level sustaied in the background gas. 

As part of an outeach elemnt we have constructed an online remote-control experiment that can be used in lecttures and demonstrations to show the basic phenomena of electrical breakdown and plasmaforation in real time. It has been trialled in lectures and will continue to be developed as part of the Open University's OpenSTEM Labs.
