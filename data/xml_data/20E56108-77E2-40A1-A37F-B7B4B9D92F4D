However, gathering data on LCCGs outcomes and impacts is both pressing and challenging, for LCCGs themselves, and for those wishing to aggregate collective impacts to assist in shaping future policy decisions.&amp;nbsp; Although useful monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) tools already exist, they are often not tailored to the needs and capacities of community groups, thus limiting groups? ability to learn from the data and improve the effectiveness and affect of activities and projects.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In response, this project explores if and how participatory knowledge exchange methods can contribute to producing M&amp;amp;E resources and practices based on the needs of UK LCCGs. Specifically, questions addressed include whether M&amp;amp;E approaches can be developed that meet both the needs of LCCGs and achieve across-group aggregation of data. Also, what outcomes are produced when diverse LCCGs share experiences of, and co-develop, M&amp;amp;E resources? These questions will be explored through participatory workshops with researchers and LCCGs to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>identify priorities and needs&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>develop pertinent M&amp;amp;E frameworks&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>pilot M&amp;amp;E resources amongst participating groups, gathering qualitative and quantitative feedback on experiences and outcomes.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Communities have a pivotal role to play in meeting the UK's ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments and sustainable development goals. To do so it is vital that groups are able to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of their actions in a grounded and self-sustaining way, which will enable them - along with coordinating networks - to make meaningful and valid contributions to national-level debates. As such, this project has a wide range of beneficiaries, who are:

1. Academics and researchers, particularly those interested in action learning research with communities; monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) of low carbon/community groups; and best practice processes for community self-evaluation.
2. Coordinating and support bodies, in particular project partners Transition Network (TN) and Low Carbon Community Network (LCCN).
3. Participating community groups, through ongoing engagement and the piloting of relevant resources within their local groups.
4. Other community groups, including those not affiliated with TN and LCCN who will be able to access M&amp;amp;E resources online.
5. Policy makers and Think Tanks interested in the community-level mitigation and adaptation.
6. Media: particularly those interested in low carbon and community-level sustainability, and how this feeds into national policy and mitigation/adaptation strategies.
7. Members of the public with an interest in community-level change, M&amp;amp;E and/or UK mitigation and resilience policy.

How will they benefit? 
1. Access to, as well as synthesis and translation of, published and ongoing research into low carbon community initiatives and M&amp;amp;E resources.
2. The creation of participatory workshop space and processes to articulate and build relevant and user-friendly M&amp;amp;E resources.
3. Capacity building for M&amp;amp;E amongst participating groups.
4. Access to grounded and piloted M&amp;amp;E resources for both participating groups and other interested groups via online availability.
5. Dedicated online spaces to learn about, and reflect upon, community-level M&amp;amp;E.
6. Opportunity for TN and LCCN to embed rigorous M&amp;amp;E into ongoing organisational practices.
7. Availability of piloted aggregate data on collective community impacts, to provide evidence base for policy making.
8. User-focused reports and academic papers/conference presentations.
9. Strengthening of existing, and establishment of new, working relationships amongst academics, project partners, advisory network members and participating groups.

What are the impacts?
This project contributes directly to the ESRC's Strategic Priorities, and thus UK economic and social life. In particular, it contributes to the theme of 'Influencing Behaviour and Informing Interventions' by helping to improve community-level sustainability and the work of participating coordination Networks: and 'A Vibrant and Fair Society', by enhancing the contribution the voluntary sector makes to low carbon development. The impacts will include:
1. The wide dissemination of academically-informed, co-developed and piloted M&amp;amp;E resources.
2. Better informed public debate about, and policy making concerning, the role of communities in low carbon futures in the UK.
3. TN and LCCN groups that are able to better understand their impacts, and thus create programmes and projects to maximize future impacts.
4. Establishment of strategic knowledge exchange partnerships, to be maintained through ongoing working relationships and/or future research.
5. Contributions to academic debates through empirically-grounded research that includes the input from communities and coordinating networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Website constructed for use by project participants, to download M&amp;amp;E tools to be trialled</gtr:description><gtr:id>B197C4B3-A65F-4913-928F-FCBFE8AF2245</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participants have been able to access a wide range of downloaded M&amp;amp;E tools</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ce6c15b51b0.88486318</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Project website</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://mescproject.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited paper Luxembourg University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4282088D-0B3D-4568-9494-DEA7CC5068F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 50 people attended an open 1-day workshop on researching communities, held at the University of Luxembourg (December, 2016).

1. Project participants: participation in this project has had significant positive impacts on low carbon community groups trailing the monitoring and evaluation tools. They have reported to us, in extensive feedback taken towards the end of the project, the value of the capacity-building and training undertaken, both for the sustainability and well-being of their group and for the impact they are having on the wider community. It has also started conversations between groups and among regional networks, about the importance of Monitoring and Evaluation to future actions, and various regional hubs (such as the Bristol Energy Network) are putting in place regular and semi-formalised Monitoring and Evaluation processes
2. Networks: this project partnered closely with the Transition Network and, less so, with the Low Carbon Communities Network. The Transition Network has reported the notable impact this project has had on the time, skills and capacity they have to be able to help their thousands of groups around the world monitor and evaluate themselves. Aspects of this project have been taken up by Transition Network, as a key part of its training and support to groups. In addition, in early 2017 Transition took over hosting of some of the tools from this project, to further embed them in their organisation. This means that the tools package developed by this project is being put into direct use and implementation by one of the key global networks for community environmental groups. In February 2017, the PI received a follow-up email from Transition, stating how useful the tools are proving for them, to help monitor their groups and the growth of their network.
3. Further impact: a comprehensive project report was completed and circulated to project participants, including members of the Advisory Network who are influential practitioners in this field. One full length paper has been published Environment and Planning A. Another paper is under preparation. Finally, the PI has been invited to various events to report on project and connect with others doing similar work i.e. the Towards European Societal Sustainability conference in Edinburgh in May 2015: a workshop help by Nesta into Monitoring and Evaluation in September 2015; and 1-day seminar on community research at Luxembourg University in December 2016. In addition, she was approached in 2016 by the community energy group Leapfrog, and presented a seminar on 27th September 2016 in London, about the social impacts of community energy. Up to March 2017, there are on-going conversations about the PI working with Leapfrog on this issue, in the near future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BF1BD20C-F6FD-4CD0-B144-54E38BC07FDA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461d0653bab70.94657268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project sough to examine and trial the feasibility of UK low carbon community groups collecting their own monitoring and evaluation data. Main findings are:
1. Seemingly simple monitoring and evaluation tools can have a significant positive impact on the groups using them, in terms of these groups being able to plan better; to consider their own progress and sustainability; and see what aspects of their external impact needs further work, in reference to their aims and goals.
2. These tools however need to be adaptable and flexible, to mirror the needs and skills within the group. As there is a such a variety of low carbon community groups-in terms of size, focus, composition, and longevity-attempting to create 'one size fits all' monitoring and evaluation tools is neither feasible nor desirable. 
3. Such flexibility and adaptability diminishes the potential to collect comparable aggregate data across similar groups or a movement. However, the trailing of a template questionnaire for groups to send out to their members did generate some comparable data, particularly on the issues of participants involvement in/perception of the group, motivations for involvement; actions taken or intended to be taken through involvement in the group.
4. Although creating online tools is useful, groups need training and support in creating and undertaking their own monitoring and evaluation. This includes having a 'champion' within their group who is able to undertake the additional tasks that monitoring and evaluation requires, as it can be time-consuming and attract additional costs to the groups running.
5. There are still open debates about the best way to evaluate the social impacts of groups' activities, particularly around issues of the distribution of social and economic benefits.

Materials and processes developed from this project:
1. Material for, and the process of, a 1-day workshop to help low carbon community groups formulate their own monitoring and evaluation strategies. These workshops were run 5 times and have been iteratively improved over that time.
2. 12 monitoring and evaluation tools for low carbon community groups, which enable them to gather data on internal group processes and structure, and external impact. These tools have been trialled over several months by 20 groups around the UK, to evaluate their usefulness and the quality of data collected. Feedback from trailing groups has been used to improve these tools, which are currently located on the project website (see below) for anyone to access and download.
3. Whilst most of the above tools were developed from existing resources, two new tools were created by this project, to measure Equity impacts, and Cost Effectiveness of low carbon community groups' projects. These tools were trialled by one Bristol-based network, and have been improved from this feedback, though further work on their development is required.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings and outputs have been taken forward by the Transition Network: a central partner in this project. Through 2016, the PI worked with Transition to incorporate this projects' findings and tools into their on-going redevelopment of the support they offer Transition groups, as well as Transition's detailed web presence. This new package was launched by Transition earlier this year (2017) and they have reported to us it is proving successful. In addition, the monitoring and evaluation tools developed during the project trials could be developed even further. In particular, the Equity Impact and Cost Effectiveness tools produced some interesting data when trialled, but requires more field testing and methodological development before they could be widely utilised. Indeed, the PI is part of an ongoing conversation with the organisation Leapfrog, about the possibility of undertaking this work in the near future. Finally, finding ways to build vital capacity for monitoring and evaluation within low carbon community groups presents a challenge and requires some creative thinking, such as possible peer-to-peer training and processes or regional specialists.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A2BD8E19-368D-4B08-AA04-BDC3E6651EF7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461d2151b3c29.19589511</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://mescproject.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Transition Training</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>007C6863-8017-4F16-8366-4B16770A150A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ce513b5bb22.31364089</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Community Energy Strategy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DEF7FF2C-45E3-419B-BA31-52305297C5CF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ce30dd55c31.67377349</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-energy-strategy</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This data takes the form of qualitative feedback from groups who had trailed the monitoring and evaluation tools.
