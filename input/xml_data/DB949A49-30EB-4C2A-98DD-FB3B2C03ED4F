Each turn of the page enacts a critical moment of simultaneous construction/demolition and it is possible to consider the pop-up book and urban regeneration as analogous, using pop-up techniques to reinterpret a changing urban landscape, specifically the London 2012 Olympics site. The project re-defines the pop-up book focusing on its role as a 'structure of enchantment'(Montanero 93). Conventional history of the pop-up involves study of its instructional and entertainment formats, but my emphasis is on its lineage in mythical storytelling through which the structures of fairytales are built. The particular myth or 'structure of enchantment' examined and critiqued here is the utopian myth of progress inherent in the 'Olympic Story' as a large-scale urban regeneration project. \nPop-up books are referred to as 'living models', 'moveable books' or 'metamorphoses' (Haining 79), through which narrative/structural animation take place. This project draws on my film and animation experience to develop the pop-up genre beyond conventional formats, exploring and comparing the temporal and narrational structures of the book with those of urban space. The pop-up form enables the visualisation of progress as ruin inspired by artist Robert Smithson's notion of 'Ruins in Reverse' (67) in which 'buildings don't fall into ruin after they are built but rather rise into ruin before they are built.' He describes the dilapidated 'Hotel Palenque'(69) as the ultimate form of this-structure undergoing constant and simultaneous decay and renovation. \nBecause structures literally rise and fall with the turn of a page, the pop-up book is the optimum medium through which to explore the entropic aspects of a specific urban landscape undergoing ruination/renewal. Using this collapsible modelling technique I critique the idealised future projections of conventional architectural models, exposing the mechanisms of change and creating an unsettled landscape on the brink of major transformation. The fellowship's conceptual and practical timeframe follows the 3 stages of construction time (Olympic site built), event time (Olympics staged) and unfolding time (legacy begins). The notions of legacy and potential are key, as from ancient Olympia to a multi-layered industrial East End site this project looks at a history/understanding of ruination (Ginsberg 04,Picon 00,Makarius 04) as potential-opening up possibilities of change and alternative imagined futures.\nA series of 3 animated books (artefacts) finalised in 1 Olympic volume will be produced which aim to counteract/intervene in the effect of tabula-rasa urbanism-animating a structural landscape from visions of the past/present/future of this zone. The pages of these books comprise theatrical installations or 'constructed situations' built out of local histories/stories, documentation and projections, presenting a panoramic and choreographic view of the site's 'before','after' and 'in-between'. A further co-authored publication ('Structuring Enchantment') and conference will explore the parallel construction processes at work in the making of both books and site and examine the unfolding time of legacy. I choose to continue my interdisciplinary engagement with the London 2012 Games using the familiar and playful pop-up book medium to engage diverse audiences and collaborators from academia to local communities. I will explore/disseminate the stories and issues surrounding the Olympic site and legacy through workshops/seminars and the production and public launch/exhibition of the pop-up books and final 'making of' publication and conference. Reinventing the boundaries of a low-tech medium I combine the site-specific approach of my urban research practice with advanced model and animation skills to investigate this high-profile and contested regeneration site.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This interdisciplinary project - focused on a contemporary, high-profile regeneration site - has significant, lasting reach beyond academia. The extended impact of the project is fundamental to its realization and management as it involves key partnerships with government agencies/cultural organizations/community groups. It is a production and event-driven model of practice-led research in which every aspect involves collaboration and exchange, building on my substantial track record of communication and public engagement in the urban arena. I draw on and expand a wide network of existing resources, partners, and participants to maximize avenues for project impact, ensuring a lasting legacy for the way in which we model and imagine urban space in regeneration processes.\n \nThe reception of my current creative practice engaging with London's Olympic-led regeneration is of proven interest/relevance to the Olympic Delivery Authority, London Development Agency and Olympic Park Legacy Company as they increasingly see value in consultation and creative interaction with the site and its future. Partnerships within this development framework include British Waterways, London Thames Gateway Development Corporation and Lee Valley Regional Park. This extends impact to the commercial developer sector and posits interdisciplinary methods of addressing place that are being adopted by organisations such as Homes and Communities Academy and Leaside Regeneration (community-based social enterprise delivering a regeneration vision for the Lower Lea Valley).\n \nThis impacts on how current/future bid/host cities examine their Olympic sites. I am working on a tour of this model of creative/critical practice engaging with Olympic-led development with a Chicago magazine/festival and continuing collaborative action on the project 'Adaptive Actions' (launched at Centre for Canadian Architecture) that explores modes of creative urban living/critique. As my recent article in 'Critical Cities: Ideas, Knowledge and Agitation from Emerging Urbanists' (2009) attests, this project is part of a wider movement of urban research placing increased value on imaginative/critical spatial practices. It influences the ways in which urban and policy think-tanks (IPPR,Demos) approach Olympic development and legacy, and impacts on major stakeholders in the delivery of the Cultural Olympiad and culture programme/legacy for the Olympic Park, from Arts Council to Art in the Open, London Culture Consortium and Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. The project is critical within the drive to explore the role of arts/culture within regeneration and provides a model of how embedded practice can contribute new knowledge. My work is recognised by MUF architects within their cultural mapping of Hackney Wick's regeneration as they too place value on the area's layered industrial/cultural history. It is at the forefront of an impulse to document the changes taking place around the site and, as such, is a valuable contribution to cross-institutional collecting programmes such as Hackney Museum's 'Mapping the Change' and London Transport Museum, Museum of London and BFI's 'Collecting the Olympics' projects.\n \nThe project has massive local impact working with the Olympic Host borough (Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Newham, Waltham Forest, Greenwich) regeneration and culture teams to work with local communities during each pop-up book's research/production/launch. The project draws on local history and resident's knowledge/memories accessed through Hackney Society and Building Exploratory (part of Architecture Centre Network). Its highly charged subject (the Olympic site) and the immediacy of its creative methodology (the pop-up book) enables it to cross boundaries and prompt debate in a range of social, cultural and political spheres - from pop-up book launches at Hackney</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>263467</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Installation inspired by the works of Derek Jarman.

Through the event, a team of dedicated pop-up apprentices made the first edition of this pop-up book charting an alternative moving history of the area of East London transformed to stage the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Legend: An A-Z of the Lea Valley is a poetic miscellany of the facts and fiction of a changing landscape. With images made using reclaimed demolition material and marshland vegetation each pop-up page is a moving vision of urban change as pylons collapse, tower blocks grow, and bombs drop. This handheld animation of regeneration is local and universal charting and reimagining industrial decline, mutating place names, flora and fauna and local legends. The book is represented by Kaleid Editions who took it straight from production line to the 2014 London Art Book Fair at the Whitechapel Gallery where it was awarded the Birgit Skiold Award for Excellence.

The project originated in my long-term work in and love of this changing area. Through an AHRC Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts at the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL I developed the use of pop-up and other moveable book techniques as a way of examining and imagining a constantly changing urban landscape.

The work produced during the fellowship (from the final pop-up book, prototypes, public outings of work in progress and related publications examining other artistic inventions and methods of critiquing urban change) provides alternative histories and narratives, undermining dominant discourse and opening up debate and imagination around the way urban change in implemented and imagined. The work is about the possibility and potential of other ways of being in our built environment informed by multiple pasts, presents and futures often undervalued or ignored by policy and public. As such it has influenced various fields and ways of thinking as it infiltrates traditionally defined disciplines,sparks debate and prompts new collaborations and conversations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1AA14BAB-06DC-43A1-B31E-3AC7C28CBE3C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546b4d40460979.01139897</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Art based at the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL set out to examine urban change around the contentious London 2012 Olympic site through the reinvigoration of the pop-up book. Pop-Up and other moveable books have been described as 'structures of enchantment' and the project created such structures of enchantment, construction and collapse to provide an alternative to the other narratives and structures of enchantment propagated by regeneration agencies and developers. It went further in creating a public production line of a pop-up A-Z of the Lea Valley employing local and university recruited 'pop-up apprentices' to take on the challenge of creating a ltd edition pop-up book of the changing area.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>An unexpected outcome was the creation of a public production line to create a find edition of a ltd edition pop-up book. This theatrical and interactive element of the project was unplanned and exciting to take forward where the making becomes a performance. The project brought industry back to a site of former (printmaking) industry and employed ten pop-up apprentices to assembly the intricate books. I am currently planning a second outing/edition and my upcoming projects as Leverhulme Artist in Residence in UCL Chemistry also uses this model of performed, publicly accessible and immersive making. On site research on demolition sites and a process of image making for the pop-up books that involves the use of reclaimed demolition site materials is now the focus on new research, practice and collaborations examining creative re-use of materials and systems of waste and value in urban regeneration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9841D88B-F7E4-45BE-A466-399AEC2A2846</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546b4bfdd55dd2.29584071</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative
