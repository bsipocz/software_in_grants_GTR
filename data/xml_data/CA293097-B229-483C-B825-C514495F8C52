Moreover, transcriptional activity itself is known to impact on chromatin structure, with several chromatin remodelling complexes identified as part of the transcription elongation machinery. However, little is known about the impact of this transcription machinery on the chromatin of intergenic regions, the reason being that once transcripts are detected, chromatin alterations have already happened. Such studies therefore require an inducible model. Using such a system, our recent work uncovered a novel mechanism of chromatin remodelling that involves non-coding RNA transcription. The enhancer blocker protein CTCF binds to the chicken lysozyme -2.4 kb cis-regulatory element and represses lysozyme gene expression. LPS stimulation induces the transient expression of non-coding RNA transcribing through the CTCF binding site. This event drives the repositioning of a nucleosome located upstream of the silencer over the CTCF binding site and leads to CTCF eviction. The purpose of this proposal is to identify the molecular details of this transcription elongation dependent chromatin reorganisation associated with abrogation of gene silencing activity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>369578</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Summary: 

Chromatin is the name for the proteins that package the long DNA molecule within the nucleus of the cell and the way chromatin structure is organised controls access to specific genes. Differential chromatin organisation can be regarded as the basis of cell identity and failures in the establishment or maintenance of this organisation lead to serious developmental defects and cancer. Inflammation is one of the responses of the organism to pathogens, however chronic inflammation leads to multiple diseases. Macrophages, which are among the first immune cells to respond to infection, are activated by inflammatory stimuli. We have previously identified change in chromatin structure mediated by these inflammatory stimuli in macrophages and have shown that this chromatin alterations was dependent upon transcription of a RNA that do not code for a protein (ncRNA). Because ncRNAs represent most of the RNA produced in the cell, this proposal was aiming at understanding the mechanism of this observed chromatin alteration assuming it might be a common mechanism of chromatin remodelling.

Main Achievements

 We characterised the promoter region of the ncRNA, a sequence of DNA immediately upstream the RNA sequence and initiating the process of transcription. The activity of this promoter is strictly dependent upon the recruitment to this promoter of a DNA binding protein called NF-?B, one of the main regulators of inflammation. NF-?B recruits IKKa, an enzyme involved in the propagation of inflammatory stimuli in the cell. IKKa activates NF-?B and is known to alter chromatin structure. 
 We showed a direct interaction between IKKa and the transcription machinery, establishing a link between changes in chromatin structure within transcribed regions and inflammatory stimuli.
 In addition, we observed two different kinetics of IKKa association with transcribing regions. A short association happening up to one hour post inflammatory signal and a longer one beyond this hour. Prolonged detection of IKKa within transcribing region is dependent upon the presence of the protein HP1?, a protein associated with chromatin. When HP1? is present, IKKa is found directly bound to chromatin and IKKa dependent chromatin alterations are distinct from changes observed before 1 hour. Further investigation will be necessary to determine if IKKa association with chromatin can be correlated with chronic inflammation and/or NF-?B dependent cancers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>How signalling drives epigenetic changes is not well understood but is a key mechanism controlling differentiation and cancer. To our knowledge, it is the first time a direct interaction between the RNA polymerase and a &amp;quot;signalling&amp;quot; enzyme was shown. In addition, we observed a link between prolonged transcription and association of this enzyme with chromatin in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. It is still unclear how this association relates to acute or chronic inflammation. Consequently, this work will be mainly taken forward or put to use by academics in future research projects and in lectures. At this stage, it is difficult to foresee the use of this work in non-academic routes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4DBF7966-C093-45A6-B37D-F1D10993E79D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7b7803f948.07270106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>20FAEFB7-6887-47BA-A1A1-D50B23E189D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Heterochromatin protein 1 gamma and I?B kinase alpha interdependence during tumour necrosis factor gene transcription elongation in activated macrophages.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8f838be0d4880bce8ec0b7f8f914c3ec"><gtr:id>8f838be0d4880bce8ec0b7f8f914c3ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thorne JL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_13407_27_22649058</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>14D92E18-975D-42E9-90F4-DEF1CF08994C</gtr:id><gtr:title>A NF-?B-dependent dual promoter-enhancer initiates the lipopolysaccharide-mediated transcriptional activation of the chicken lysozyme in macrophages.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5e0eeec41945b341efdbcfea3c7ee745"><gtr:id>5e0eeec41945b341efdbcfea3c7ee745</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Witham J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_13407_27_23533622</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DB6EAD22-FF60-4EC1-BD9F-E8546535F65A</gtr:id><gtr:title>CTCF depletion alters chromatin structure and transcription of myeloid-specific factors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of molecular cell biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11051aa58fa893d99378a353608c0731"><gtr:id>11051aa58fa893d99378a353608c0731</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ouboussad L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1759-4685</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f93b93bb35dee4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G001391/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
