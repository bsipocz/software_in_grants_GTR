Public offices, private enterprises and technical innovation: the career of Assay Master Alchorne (1727-1800).</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Training Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I02478X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project examines the history of the Royal Mint (RM) during difficult years in the eighteenth century. It studies for the first time the Mint's distinguished but neglected Assay Master Stanesby Alchorne (1727-1800). Historians have held the RM in Alchorne's time responsible for the serious problems with the supply and quality of coinage, and compared it unfavourably with the entrepreneur Matthew Boulton's Soho Mint in Birmingham. This view has begun to be challenged. The project offers a case study of contemporary relevance to questions about whether, both in past and contemporary Britain, scientific and technological innovation is best supported by state institutions or private business. Given current plans to introduce private capital to the RM and changes in government policy on funding of academic research, it is especially timely.\n\nAs a Collaborative Doctoral Award, there is a second context. As part of its transformation, the RM is seeking to establish new roles for its Museum. A permanent visitor attraction will be established at the Tower of London, its collections will go on display, and a website will be developed. The doctoral student will, therefore, gain invaluable skills to enable them to be heavily involved curatorially as the Museum brings the Mint's heritage to a bigger and international public.\n\nMore specifically, the project will produce a scholarly study of Alchorne, using it to re-assess the capacity of an officer within a state-controlled institution to work efficiently in an era of scientific and technological change. On the one hand, with doubts about the cost and efficiency of the great gold recoinage and the inferior production of silver and copper coin, there is no doubt that the Mint was in need of some reform, which it underwent after Alchorne's death. On the other, Alchorne was praised even by the Mint's critics as attaining an unsurpassed standard of assaying.\n\nThe study will consider two complementary aspects. First is Alchorne, officer at the Mint. His place in the Mint's operational and administrative structure, as successor to the distinguished assayer and astronomer Joseph Harris, will be analysed, and the constraints and opportunities upon him identified. A valuable monograph will be produced detailing the month-by-month output of the Mint under his tenure. For the first time also, two systematic but unpublished treatises by Alchorne, one of the economics of currency, the other the product of a research trip to continental mints, will be studied.\n\nSecond is Alchorne the man of Enlightenment science, who performed metallurgical experiments, published in the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions, corresponded with luminaries like Boulton and Wedgewood, collected rare books and coins, and who was a distinguished botanist after whom is named a genus of medicinal herbs. To what extent was this innovative environment beyond the Mint of entrepreneurs and gentleman virtuosi reflected in his professional activities?\nThe project's objectives are to produce a Ph.D. dissertation on Alchorne and the Mint, to publish important sections and the analysis of the Mint's output in academic journals, to provide the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography with an entry for Alchorne, to provide material for the Museum's new exhibition space and website, and to provide the researcher with the skills to communicate the Mint's heritage to a wide public, for example in public lectures. It also aims to cast light on the question of state versus private sponsorship of innovation.\n\nAs the non-academic partner, the Royal Mint wishes to apply the results of this study as a pilot for new ways in which it will present aspects of its heritage to the public. A major benefit will be the acquisition by the Museum of personnel with scholarly skills and authority as it expands its activities. These are on top</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research encompassed by this CDA will have a considerable impact on the study of government, economics, business and enterprise, and scientific and technological change in Britain in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. A central focus on the career of Stanesby Alchorne will allow the research to be presented in an integrated fashion, so that the complex methodologies involved can benefit from full accessibility. \n\nThe proposed CDA has the potential for considerable impact beyond the academic community, both because of the intrinsic interest of the subject of the history of the Royal Mint in the context of national heritage and because of the specific non-academic communities for which the Mint caters. \n\nThe Royal Mint is not only a centre for technological research, development, and historical research in the area of currency manufacture, but a leading exporter of currency in the form of specie coin, medals and commemorative items for official use in over 60 countries. The scholarly research underlying the project, by making available new knowledge of the Mint's history during a critical period, will feed into the commercial research and development arm of the Royal Mint's contemporary functions. \n\nDissemination of the research will be made available beyond the immediate academic community. As part of its transformation from government agency to government-owned company, the Royal Mint is seeking to establish new roles for the Museum. Although its collections of coins, medals, master tooling, objects associated with the manufacture of currency and drawings and plans, are unrivalled in the UK, they are not currently accessible to the general public. The Museum's activities will be given a much greater profile, and the research to be undertaken for this project will play a key part as a pilot.\n\nIn addition, from 2012-13 the Royal Mint intends to establish a permanent visitor attraction at the Tower of London, which will form an outreach arm of the Royal Mint's activities to the public. The proposed research will play a crucial role in shaping the presentation, style and approach of the interpretation of material on display both at the Museum in Llantrisant and in London. It is anticipated that Joseph Payne will be heavily involved in the drafting of interpretative signs, labels, published guides and tours. Moreover, a dedicated section on the Royal Mint Museum's new website will be produced and maintained as a specific outcome of the project.\n\nIn these ways, the impact of the research and knowledge of the Royal Mint's heritage will be made available to visitors from the UK and overseas, and to users of the website worldwide. Elements of the research will also be disseminated through a range of public lectures sponsored by the Royal Mint. \n \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I02478X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
