This work will be based on experiments and modeling of oxygen combustion, and the replacement of air with produced O2 and recycled CO2. The research plan builds from this core to include affected ancillary
processes. Experimentation in simulated oxyfiring, and modeling of the gas and solids flow within the kiln and calciner will feed results to the remaining work. Scientifically the approach starts from the known and then adds layers of innovation. The cement industry has been making incremental improvements for 100 years and any changes will build from this base.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed work will open a realistic option in the UK (and globally) for decarbonisation of the cement industry. It is important to note that the project actually involves both enhancement of the efficiency of the cement production process and the production of a concentrated stream of CO2, suitable for sequestration.

Economic impact: The case for this technology is compelling if the global energy system is to decarbonise. Improved efficiency is win-win in terms of both CO2 emission and reduced resource utilisation (and in general is advantageous to the economics of the process, provided excessive capex is not entailed). The field of industrial carbon capture and storage is underdeveloped in comparison to that within the power sector, with fewer studies conducted. This is for two major reasons: firstly, much of the information relating to industrial processes is proprietary, and secondly the industrial sector as a whole (with the exception of gas processing) has been less forward in embracing the technology. The key reason for this is that whilst electricity has to be generated and used in reasonable geographical proximity, the same does not apply to many commodity products: Cement can quite easily be shipped. This means that the same policies driving low carbon electricity production (such as the EU ETS) are not as readily applied in areas less likely to impose carbon taxes. Hence, efforts to mitigate GHG emissions within the EU are very susceptible to &amp;quot;CO2 leakage&amp;quot; (the term generally used in the academic world) or alternatively &amp;quot;destroying our ability to compete internationally&amp;quot; (frequently the view of industry). In order to retain their competitive edge, G8 countries (including the UK) must innovate to ensure that their products remain competitive with countries where CO2 emission does not have a price.

By 2050, the IEA [1] has projected that in order to fulfill the aims of the &amp;quot;Blue Map&amp;quot; scenario, CCS on industrial sources will comprise 19 % of all GHG mitigation in the energy sector, and be approximately as important as CCS for electricity generation.

Turning specifically to the application of carbon capture and storage on industrial sources, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido) [2] states that &amp;quot;This area has so far not been the focus of discussions and therefore much attention needs to be paid to the application of CCS to industrial sources if the full potential of CCS is to be unlocked&amp;quot;. 

The combination of systems analysis and experimental development will allow us to rigorously examine the viability of the novel technology and the impact that it will have on the cement industry. The UK has the engineering and chemical engineering skills base to adopt and exploit improved methodologies, improved materials and/or processes that may be developed. World-leading UK companies would be well placed to exploit the work and significant opportunities for the export of products and services would exist as a result of the global natures of the cement business. Regulatory frameworks, government initiatives and societal push are increasingly aligned to aid the promote business opportunities in the manufacturing area. The universities involved provide commercialisation services and e.g. business and venture capital contacts to facilitate commercialisation and knowledge transfer.

The production of cement, the binding agent in concrete, contributes about 7-10% of current global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, mainly as a result of calcination of raw material limestone and burning fuels to maintain high temperature in a kiln during the production of cement clinker. These emissions are expected to increase by 50% by 2020 and more than double by 2050.

The project led to the development of a redesigned cement plant with improved material efficiency, including reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and enhanced waste disposal (alternative fuels). These objectives have been met by redesigning the manufacturing process, enhancing the re-use and recycling of waste concrete and producing longer lasting products, by enhancing the mineral properties of clinker. The scientific quality of the consortium is based on all PIs working at the forefront of their fields.

The redesign have replaced air with produced oxygen within the combustion process. Oxy-fuel combustion involves burning fuel in a mixture of recycled CO2 and pure O2 instead of air and results in a flue gas that is composed mainly of CO2 and water vapour, which is easily separated at low cost by condensation process.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D823BF6-F196-4BA6-9D49-B3B82942ED78</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545cc3b2d007c3.85795353</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Good-quality cements have been successfully produced in an oxy-fuel atmosphere in Professor Paul Fennell's lab.
