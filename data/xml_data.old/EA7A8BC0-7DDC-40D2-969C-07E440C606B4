While considerable academic attention has been focused on the role of 'world' and 'global' cities in national and international economies and the social challenges they face, a similar degree of systematic analysis has not been afforded to medium-sized post-industrial cities. Yet these cities have over the past three decades experienced a transformation in their economic and social base. The purpose of the seminar series was to examine the problems facing medium-sized cities: exploring the barriers inhibiting successful regeneration and the policy levers available for overcoming these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminar series considered the general factors reshaping the economic base of medium-sized cities together with the various strategies adopted for achieving regeneration. It also examined the social challenges affecting medium-sized cities. In particular, the series examined the changing demographic nature of these cities, inequalities between social groups, high levels of population turnover, and growing ethnic diversity. It brought together policy-makers and social scientists from a range of countries to consider the challenges and policy responses.&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18582</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>60000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ACORN and Local Enterprise Partnership funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Keele University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>930A1B80-D888-40F9-8424-9C76E3908AB2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56af31a468f2a0.73459884</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Keele University and Stoke City Council jointly-funding a PhD (supervised by Dr Catney) to investigate the governance and business engagement in Local Enterprise Partnerships. The studentship seeks to help increase Staffordshire LEP's capacity for policy learning and innovation. A second PhD is under development in association with a local housing association.
Arising from this seminar series, Dr Catney was asked to give a guest lecture to the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) in April 2010 localism and the regeneration of medium-sized cities. Potential for impact with this organisation was significantly affected by the withdrawal of public funding from its activities later that year. 
Dr Catney has given more than 26 interviews (March 2010 - March 2013) on urban regeneration to media outlets such as BBC Radio Stoke and BBC Radio Sheffield. In July 2013, he was also featured in a series of reports by BBC Radio 5 Live on Stoke's regeneration.

The series was vital in shaping the focus of three proposals. The first was a &amp;pound;2.4m bid, led by Professor Phillipson (with Dr Catney) in collaboration with Manchester and Sheffield universities, to the ESRC/AHRC Connected Communities call. The proposal focuses on intensive community-level research to explore high levels of disengagement in deprived communities. Following peer-review, the bid was unsuccessful. .

With the second, Dr Catney and Prof. Phillipson were involved in developing a proposal led by Prof. David Amigoni (Keele). Ideas from the project were used to develop a large multi-institutional bid to AHRC Connected Communities call on Communities, Culture, Health and Well-being. The project made it to interview stage but was unsuccessful. 

The third was a successful ESRC International Network bid on Population Ageing and Urbanisation [IPNS - ES/J019631/1]; some of the background to this was developed as a consequence of the seminars.

Dr Catney (May 2014) is also part of a National Science Foundation networking grant application on shrinking medium-sized cities in Europe and North America.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F49C1948-6963-40FF-BEA1-BC715A87C5D2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54648b7f605106.90057961</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A number of findings arose from the seminar series. The first was that the term 'medium-sized', while helpful for positioning a city within an urban hierarchy, is a complex term as there are various types of MSCs in the UK. It found that post-industrial MSCs are often characterised by high-levels of worklessness, poor educational attainment, and high levels of ill health. In part, explanations for this were related to geographical position (and the nature of the economic structure of city-region relationships); weak political and public service institutions; and outward migration of skilled sections of the population. Significantly, evidence was cited of the role that stigma can play in shaping decision-making by institutional investors for regeneration. The series also examined the responses to the problems of MSCs from the previous Labour government and the current Coalition Government. In particular, it examined the potential effects of the government's agenda is seeking to promote sub-regional institutions and reducing the scale of central government support for cities often heavily dependent on public spending. 
The seminars also considered alternative approaches to dealing with 'distressed cities', drawing upon international case studies. Three broad approaches were considered: neo-classical approaches of relaxing planning regulations to enable MSCs to compete; greater citizen involvement in strategic planning; and improving the quality of life in MSCs.
Subsequent to this seminar series commencing, a series of think tank reports started to highlight the role of MSCs in the national economy, e.g. the Centre for Cities (2010) and the Work Foundation (2010) both underscored the importance of MSCs for the national economy. Representatives from the Centre for Cities presented evidence at our second seminar.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The seminar series developed the concept of medium-sized cities and provided a forum for discussion on the position of this category of city in the urban hierarchy.
