The results of the interdisciplinary approach highlight the unique benefit of developing both the methodology and the pharmacy applications. 
Coronary heart disease is the subject of a recent guideline developed by the Department of Health and is a priority health area. The Community Pharmacy Medicines Management project, springboard to my completed doctoral program, was funded by the Department of Health to promote the development of an innovative pharmacy-based medicines management service. The Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) technique allows evaluation, from a patient perspective, of an alternative pharmaceutical service for patients with chronic disease. Different traditional approaches in benefit evaluations, such as clinical outcome, quality of life and patient satisfaction, are commonly used in pharmacy health services research. Their contribution to benefit evaluation is presented, possible limitations are discussed and results are compared to the innovative DCE methodology. Such approaches are then incorporated into the economic evaluation framework in order to advise how to maximise the allocation of scarce resources when implementing pharmacy health services. The impact on policy makers of different results from such alternative approaches is then discussed. Understanding the choices made by patients is important for health professionals and policy makers such that health promotion and health interventions can be improved to fully incorporate a patient-centred approach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1. What I have done

The aims of the PhD programme, supported by an ESRC/MRC PhD studentship, were twofold: to consider the implications of taking a patient-centred approach to evaluating a proposed policy change in community pharmacy and to develop and apply the DCE methodology to pharmacy. To do this I: conducted a review of the literature relating to benefit evaluation and its application to the economic evaluation framework in pharmacy; applied more traditional benefit evaluation approaches to the pharmacy setting, such as clinical outcomes, quality of life and satisfaction surveys; developed an alternative approach to benefit evaluation, namely DCE, looking at both different design approaches and welfare estimation issues when analysing the data; applied the DCE to pharmacy, comparing the results with those of other approaches and considered the impact on policy when different results are available from different approaches. 

2. What I will do

The aims of the fellowship are: training, disseminating, reanalysing data and developing new research ideas from my PhD work. A postdoctoral fellowship would allow me to write for peer reviewed publication the full results from the PhD and to enhance my research skills in three main areas (development of DCEs, their application to pharmacy, and their impact on benefit evaluations in health care). The proposed programme of work will cover three ESRC/MRC priority areas of research such as economics of health, prevention and management of chronic health problems and health services delivery. Publishing in journals of health economics, social sciences and primary care would help me to establish myself in the field of health economics and primary care in a distinctive way. I will bring my research to the attention of peers and will be subject to critical scrutiny by them. Presenting my work at local, national and international meetings to both academic and non academic audiences would be of benefit in terms of disseminating my work, networking and also in developing my oral presentation skills. The fellowship will secure time to re-analyse the DCE data adopting different methods of analysis and incorporating the output into an economic evaluation modelling framework. I would also develop future research plans and write research proposals to continue developing the DCE technique with application to pharmacy and broaden my expertise in health economics and health services research. Future research will be planned to develop external validity tests in DCEs, where DCE findings could be compared with respondents? actual preferences. Since DCE is a stated preferences technique we do not know if respondents are willing to choose in reality what they are stating with the DCE experiment. Given that patients spend their own money to purchase OTC drugs or to benefit from some pharmacy clinics, the community pharmacy offers a unique setting to apply external validity tests in health economics.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>140092</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Health Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Nurse and pharmacist independent prescribing 2</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8F23C98-9A3E-40E3-B384-78BE080A9641</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of findings with presentation at conferences and publication in peer reviewed journals is under way;

Overlapping interests supported the planning of collaborative work (three grant proposals were submitted with Universities of Keele/Southampton, Reading and LSE). I also contributed to a Department of Health funded project looking at valuing independent nurse and pharmacist prescribing services (collaborative work with Southampton and Keele) and to a EU-funded project evaluating cross-border care in Europe (13 EU partners project led by LSE).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>WMvEjS5ffeF</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Systematic Review and Empirical Comparison of Contemporaneous EQ-5D and SF-6D Group Mean Scores</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>11B0C468-72AE-402A-A165-7C954BE9E03C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper &amp;quot;Seymour J, McNamee P, Scott A, Tinelli M.
