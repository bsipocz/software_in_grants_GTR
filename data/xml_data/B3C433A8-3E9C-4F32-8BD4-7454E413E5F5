real time activated sludge monitoring system, that would enable the waste water industry
to dramatically cut their energy consumption and carbon footprint.
Fundamental to the process of dealing with wastewater is the generation of a stable population
of microorganisms in the process plant for the purification of raw sewage and commercial
waste. The process is continuous and kept in balance by adjusting flow rates of effluent and
by maintaining the correct oxygen content to allow efficient microbial growth and
purification. Air is forced into the &amp;quot;activated sludge&amp;quot; by large compressors to maintain the
gaseous composition. Key causes of poorly performing plants are inadequate plant operation
control and testing. Increasingly, biological monitoring is seen as the solution to optimising
processes and is a significant driver within the industry. Currently there are no microbial
monitoring systems suitable for real time process control. The industry spends up to 50% of
its energy OPEX on ad-hoc aeration of activated sludge with the aim to optimise bacterial
activity in waste water treatment plants. Currently the standard test is BOD5 which takes 5 to
7 days for results to come back to the plant by which time the ?situation? has dramatically
changed. Thus the test can be useless. The industry has been seeking a solution to this
problem for years. An on-line, reliable, real time BOD analysis device (or analogue) would
transform control and lead to enhanced discharge standards and lower, optimised, energy
consumption throughout the industry.
In order to address this business opportunity BACTEST will need to modify its current proven
technology platform CYTOMAIA that was designed to be used in a portable contamination
testing instrument (Speedy Breedy) such that the technology could be used in a larger device
that would permanently reside on a waste water plant sampling activated sludge, testing and
transmitting results to a monitoring centre. This would enable plant operators to have results
on the ?health? of bacterial activity every hour (as opposed to every 7 days) enabling them to
make more efficient use of aeration resulting is lower energy spend. In addition the data
generated by Shepherd will also be transmitted to BACTEST where a database will be grown
and software tools built to analyse waste water facilities to assist in management and planning
of waste water facilities.
Project outcomes from this TSB project will prove that our technology platform can be
modified as outlined above and will culminate in 2 prototypes being deployed on test waste
water facilities, one at Anglian Water in Cambridge, the other at Cranfield University.
Industry experts used to trouble shooting problem plants suggest savings of 20% should be a
target for well controlled processes.
We anticipate proof of concept will cost around &amp;pound;168,000 and take 12 months.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710027</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
