Eastern logics however, and much of our own everyday reasoning, commonly appeal to analogy by structural similarity and the transfer not of truth but merely of qualified belief. 
For example if I know that my 10 year old nephew enjoyed a Christmas party in the local swimming pool I might recommend this possibility to a colleague who wishes to arrange a birthday party for her 9 year old daughter.

Whilst such reasoning is clearly not foolproof, recent results of the PI, proposed RA and A.Hill, have shown that one can supply a solid theoretical foundation for the RATIONALITY of reasoning by such analogical similarity within the framework of Pure Inductive Logic. These results suggest three further questions: What are the boundaries on analogy by structural similarity as a rationally justified mode of reasoning? Can we develop a logic of analogical reasoning by structural similarity? To what extent can the roles be reversed and Western, Aristotelian, Logic be explained as derived from this alternative logic of analogy? 

These are the main questions that the proposed research intends to pursue.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The initial primary benefactors of the proposed research will be the academic communities detailed in the above `Academic Beneficiaries' section. In the longer term one would expect wider benefits to accrue through the following pathways.

Researchers in AI and IT are constantly monitoring ideas in logical theories of reasoning with an eye to possible implementation. Once published and disseminated, the proposed investigations into analogy with their direct link to transparent everyday argumentation would be prime targets for such consideration.

Rationality is a central topic within Philosophy (and the Humanities in general) because it is a key ingredient in the way we act, the decisions and judgements that we make, and the manner in which we justify them. Philosophers and Social Scientists are increasingly using their understanding of this concept to advise public and private bodies on issues of policy, the law, ethics, sustainability, education, advertising, entertainment, etc.. With the mathematical precision and clarity that we anticipate of our findings, and their planned widespread dissemination within that community, we would expect them to acquire relevance and influence in this pattern.

The proposed study of Indian and Chinese logics promises to foster a possibly better understanding of their heritage and culture in general.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>301845</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As the first part of our current proposal we have formulated and investigated a family of principles of analogical support based on structural similarity. Following the development of a `transfer property' across logical languages we have a very effective method for proving/disproving such principles from basic (rational) symmetry principles. For example enabling us to compare the support afforded by multiple analogies. These theoretical results encouragingly seem very much in line with everyday experience -- for example cases where multiple analogies provide less support than each individually. 

At the same time we have undertaken a mathematical formulation of the picture of analogical reasoning within philosophy as commonly proposed, for example in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and shown that it is seriously compromised. Hopefully when this research is better understood by that community it will prevent further errors of a similar nature.

As also proposed in the project we have written two papers on analogy in early Indian Logic which intend to throw a new light on some of the arcane questions therein. The first paper is intended largely for a philosophy audience and has been submitted to the Journal of Indian Philosophy, whilst the second is a more technical account aimed at the Inductive Logic community. 

I should add that this is a 3 year project and right now we are only up to 18 months so we would expect more to follow yet.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are publishing papers, providing additional documents on the web and speaking at numerous conferences and workshops.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B24E98F5-995E-4649-9BC4-80EAFA83BFDE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cdc8fa060b20.36871266</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6175964-1DC7-4A37-978A-2ED60C6F7D4D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pure Inductive Logic</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/66d8f8cd4ffad47cfe36bf6067ff2e85"><gtr:id>66d8f8cd4ffad47cfe36bf6067ff2e85</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Paris, J.B.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-107-04230-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5655d2d949ad61.56487281</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2348C115-272B-49BC-8431-65405BBDD453</gtr:id><gtr:title>An examination of the SEP candidate analogical inference rule within pure inductive logic</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Applied Logic</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b609f310760a51ffd38c33d0831374ea"><gtr:id>b609f310760a51ffd38c33d0831374ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Howarth E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d6a5e34200b8.13859655</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77B16308-B0BD-4885-981F-7D9BA19CA71A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Combining Analogical Support in Pure Inductive Logic</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Erkenntnis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9b6dcd4fce3cca1cd1af684b9b37a464"><gtr:id>9b6dcd4fce3cca1cd1af684b9b37a464</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Paris J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a17b82b71084.35753494</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C1B942A3-4D1A-45CC-B1D0-5FD536FD0D1E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Computational Models of Rationality, Essays Dedicated to Gabriele Kern-Isberner on the Occasion of her 60th Birthday</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/18a6ffd5bf292b69981c604f9db15d9f"><gtr:id>18a6ffd5bf292b69981c604f9db15d9f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Howarth,E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-84890-198-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58a17a4bc1b0a2.96754996</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A3902A6-8A8A-490E-B203-E089912B3DBE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constrained approximation of effective generators for multiscale stochastic reaction networks and application to conditioned path sampling</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Computational Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/73b12777ae9916557655ee74225de940"><gtr:id>73b12777ae9916557655ee74225de940</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cotter S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9844a64aef26.64130505</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L023989/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
