research income, currently in receipt of almost &amp;pound;200m &amp;amp; is one of EPSRCs Framework Partners. In REF 2014, 97%
of our research was judged as world leading or internationally excellent. 90% of our research impact was rated
world leading &amp;amp; we rank in the top 3 universities worldwide for the quality of spinouts.
We are training over 3,000 postgraduate research students, the majority within the EPSRC remit. Covering the
vast majority of the EPSRC themes, our research spans the spectrum of activity from fundamental science to
industrially relevant research.
As well as undertaking core research in individual disciplines, we actively encourage interdisciplinary
collaboration amongst strategic research groups, and with our research institutes these provide PGR
opportunities for cross-cutting, leading-edge research environments.
The training and supporting of PGRs to develop future leaders is vital to our mission. They form an integral
part of our research community making important joint contributions and adding intellectual vitality. To
embed this philosophy at all levels, the University has established a Doctoral College 
http://www.southampton.ac.uk/doctoral-college (DC) to provide:
 an inspiring research environment &amp;amp; support the development of independent researcher leaders
 a vibrant environment to help PGRs to connect &amp;amp; collaborate with researchers from other disciplines &amp;amp;
exploit their potential impact
 a route to oversee &amp;amp; enhance the support, training &amp;amp; monitoring of PGRs at group, faculty &amp;amp; University
level
 policy, training &amp;amp; advice to supervisors to guide PGRs to achieve their full potential
To attract the very best students regardless of background, we run a transparent admissions process with a
common application form, selection against a person specification, and all selectors receive diversity training.
All Faculty Graduls provide an extensive range of courses that broaden &amp;amp; deepen the technical skills
of our Doctoral Researchers (e.g. http://www.gradschool.fpse.soton.ac.uk/training&amp;amp;courses#AU).
Every student has an initial (&amp;amp; then annual) academic needs analysis that identifies any subject specific gaps &amp;amp;
involves an assessment of their personal, professional &amp;amp; research skills. All PGRs must complete an ethics
course. Monitoring &amp;amp; logging of all PGR progression &amp;amp; training activity is through a web-based PGR Tracker
system.
Each year EPSRC awards four-year DTP funding to the University of about &amp;pound;5m. The PVC Research &amp;amp; Enterprise
is responsible for internal allocation, advised by a panel of 4 senior academics from Engineering, ICT, Physical
Sciences &amp;amp; Mathematical Sciences, chaired by the Director of the DC. Once provisional DTP funding allocation
is received from EPSRC the panel distributes it strategically to support the research mission of the University,
EPSRC strategy &amp;amp; cross council initiatives, taking into account the EPSRC themes where the DTP has been
earned.
The panel provides a strong steer on DTP use (e.g., support of new initiatives, new staff, particular
interdisciplinary areas etc). Detailed allocation of funding to projects occurs at Faculty level who report back
on their implementation of strategy.
Up to ten Doctoral Prizes are awarded, based on a written case, presentation &amp;amp; interview with the DTP panel.
Competition is fierce with almost 4 applications for each place. CASE conversion is a strategic priority and well
over 10% of the DTP is reserved and distributed through a University wide competition.
Some 40% of our research portfolio involves a significant collaboration with companies that range from SMEs
to blue chip corporates. As a result, many PGRs also receive partial external funding, enabling us to
substantially multiply the number of DTP studentships, whilst enhancing the training experience &amp;amp; the
opportunities for impact</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8694380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509747/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
