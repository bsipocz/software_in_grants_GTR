Hairdressers use a lot of energy, water and chemicals, but preliminary research (Baden, 2010) indicated that, despite the increased concerns and public pronouncements on the importance of sustainability, little awareness has filtered into the hairdressing sector. This lack of attention to environmental issues by hairdressers then constitutes a social norm that is antagonistic to sustainability awareness, especially hair-washing, drying and colouring, which are activities that are also carried out at home. Thus the study aims to engage hairdressers, both in developing their own sustainability practices, and as ?catalytic individuals? to diffuse practices and ideas relating to responsible chemical, energy and water use across their social networks.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research helps in meeting the targets set by the UK Government (Dec 2008) to reduce emissions by 80% below the 1990 levels by 2050. Directly, as the aim is to enable the hairdressing sector to reduce their environmental impact in terms of reducing consumption of energy, water and toxic chemicals. We also expect a more long-term effect in terms of developing social norms of pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) in the wider population. There are also indirect impacts as we aim to determine the most effective strategies to enable SMEs to reduce their environmental impact and to explore the efficacy of a bottom up social marketing approach to PEB. 

Learning outcomes from the project will assist policy makers at Global, European, National and local level to design effective initiatives to promote PEB. For example, this bottom-up social marketing approach could also be extended to include other individuals who, by virtue of their wide and diverse social network based on their occupation, are in a position to model and thus 'norm' PEBs relevant to their areas of practice (e.g. taxi-drivers). 

The participating hairdressers benefit not just through cost savings, but through reputation enhancement, increased attractiveness to customers who value sustainable companies, positive employee responses and staying ahead of the increasing body of environmental regulation. In particular they will gain membership of the SE Business Carbon Hub and attain the Steps to Environmental Management (STEM) environmental certification which is specifically designed for SMEs. Working with other community groups also increases social capital and networking opportunities which can be key factors in local business success (Granovetter, 1985, Fuller 2006). 

The SE Carbon Hub and Kent County Council who run STEM benefit from meeting their targets to recruit small businesses. 

Participating hairdressers will be encouraged to share their experiences with other businesses via their personal contacts and networking groups, so that other businesses can also benefit indirectly as useful advice and information is fed into the business network. Other SMEs will benefit from the outputs of this project such as the online sustainable business pack (supplied via Sustainable Business Partnership) which will disseminate information and ideas regarding sustainable business practice. 

Suppliers of eco-friendly hair products will benefit through increased sales. 

The local community will benefit from reduced pollution and waste achieved as a result of the project. 

Hairdressers are at increased risk of certain cancers and skin conditions due to the toxicity of many hair products (Gube et al, 2011; Harling et al., 2010), and therefore benefit from decreased health risks as they switch to less toxic products. 

Customers of participating hairdressers benefit from exposure to more pro-environmental practices in the context of hair care, which may enable them to identify less toxic products for their own use, with corresponding health benefits, and cost benefits relating to decreased energy and water consumption.

Central hairdressing organisations (e.g. the Hairdressing Council, HABIA) have offered their support to the project, in terms of attending the events, disseminating information, knowledge and ideas about sustainability through their newsletters and networks, and incorporating best practice guidelines into any relevant training initiatives or educational materials. Those involved in training hairdressers will thus have access to information on PEBs and guidelines specific to hairdressing, mediated through these bodies, specifically HABIA which is the government approved standards setting body for the hair and beauty sector. Highbury College will assist in incorporating learning outcomes into their training courses. This increases the impact as new pro-environmental practices will spread through the sector through improved training programmes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78773</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>VTCT</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Knowledge Exchange with VTCT</gtr:description><gtr:id>EB1828D4-691D-45AB-B878-EAE3F65DA16C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We now have received ESRC Knowledge Exchange funding to work with industry bodies such as VTCT and City &amp;amp; Guilds - the two main awarding organisations for the Hair and Beauty Sector to embed learning outcomes into hairdresser training running from Nov 2014 for 12 months.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9d91d0eb9d91d2c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>VTCT are providing some funds &amp;pound;12000), and also premises and help in the form of staff time and resources to support this project.

We achieved a high uptake of ideas and the benefits to the salons included cost savings by using less products and energy, and also health benefits to hairdressers by switching to greener products. Hairdressers gained increased publicity by obtaining environmental management certification. In addition we worked with VTCT, a government approved awarding organisation offering vocationally related qualifications within the hair and beauty sector who are building our findings into their product range to develop new sustainability-related training modules for hairdressers. Positive environmental impact was also achieved as hairdressers passed on information relating to less resource-intensive hair-care to their customers. Results showed that a barrier to sustainability in hairdressing was lack of training, and so we have recently been awarded funds from the ESRC for knowledge exchange activities working with hairdressing colleges and trainers and awarding bodies such as City and Guilds and VTCT to integrate sustainability into hairdresser training.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>298AD9F0-7132-4F76-B0FF-FD66CF3B2657</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>541850a15c00a7.88091777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key Findings

1. Awareness and Implementation of Sustainability Issues and Practices

Hairdressers who took part in the project increased their awareness of sustainability issues such as energy efficiency, water saving, waste management within the salon, toxicity of products etc. Initially they felt the barrier in embracing all of this rested on resource issues, cost and budgetary constraints. Taking part in this project provided them with the motivation, inspiration and information to consider many sustainability issues, in their day-to-day salon activities. For example, our motivational expert explained, in simple terms, the importance of sustainability and the larger picture of using up a finite resource of a single planet, fittingly connecting it to their work, as a sector, in raising the self-esteem of people through their hair and beauty services and ultimately keeping the people happy. 

Our industry expert provided examples of successful ways salons have achieved cost savings through simple tips and techniques on energy efficiency- electricity and water saving and resource efficiency - hair products purchase, paper usage etc. The expert also shared technical tips on efficient blow-drying techniques, hair products usage etc. 

Participants at the follow-on event, shared their successes and barriers in implementing sustainability practices within their salon. They unanimously agreed on overall benefits to business across all fronts. For example:

? Cost savings across the salon on 

- Reduced electricity usage, changing to energy efficient light bulbs, quick and efficient blow drying methods, usage of innovative products such as thermal caps that replace hood dryers, etc.

- Reduced water usage - fitting flow restrictors, efficient shower heads, efficient use of washing machine, use of disposable eco-towels, washing hair/shampooing once etc.

- Reduced use of hair products - shampooing not more than once, tips for colour mixing, innovative reduced amount shampoo dispenser, switching to greener, environmentally friendly hair products.

- Reduced waste- monitoring product waste, resend packaging back to suppliers/wholesalers, wormery - vermicomposting waste hair, reduce paper usage within salon, innovative tips for appointment cards etc.

? Health benefits to hairdressers from switching to ammonia free and greener products. 

? Suppliers were able to discuss issues related to organic hair products and offer samples such as biodegradable eco-towels, organic hair care products for participants to take away and try.

? Hairdressers shared examples of reduced incidences of dermatitis with staff upon switching to organic colour products.

? Increased publicity and clientele confidence on businesses with green credentials, environmental certification etc. 



Hairdressers agreed to the importance of simple pro-environmental behaviours that would lead to many of the above. 



2. Awareness and Modelling of Pro-Environmental Behaviours (PEBs) to clients

Hairdressers, after attending our events, felt they were motivated and aware of PEBs. The next step, and where hairdressers could achieve the most impact, was in more environmentally friendly hair care practices to their clients. Key issues on modelling PEBs to clients, were minimising shampoo use in salons, and talking to clients about it, as shampooing and washing hair are normal activities carried out at home. The benefits of alternate products such as dry shampoos were discussed, and suppliers promoted the new range of dry shampoos which are more effective as well as being the hair care product with the lowest carbon footprint in the market. Blow drying was another key issue that was discussed by the experts as one that not only increases the electricity costs but also damages hair on repeated use. Tips and techniques for efficient blow-drying for both long and short hair, as demonstrated by the experts were well received by the hairdressers, and we encouraged them to pass such tips onto their clients.



Repeated hair colouring both involves toxic products and high energy and water use, and can also damage hair, and lead to health issues for the hairdressers. While some hairdressers were happy to discuss reduced levels of colouring to clients, others felt they should colour as often as the clients asked with no discussion of alternatives. However all hairdressers they felt very encouraged by the demonstration and results of colouring using 100% organic products, at our follow-on events. Many believed prior to the demonstration that organic hair colour was less effective, but the demonstration made it clear to all that it is actually more effective and has less negative health implications and is kinder to both hair and skin. However it does need a different mode of application and this was fully demonstrated. Many signed up to switching to 100% organic products following our event, and felt this will have a positive impact on their business. 



 Hairdressers were enthused with new information, and agreed that it made business and environmental sense to adopt these in their day-to-day activities and more importantly model these to their clients, as many of the above were carried out at home on a regular basis. 

The University of Southampton organised a series of TEDx talks on Sustainability and Project Lead Dr. Denise Baden, presented a very informative talk on this study. The video can be found here: URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mP0gnSSAhI. 

The key issue that we promoted through this project was that both section 1 and 2 above were intrinsically connected. 



3. Need for Embedding Sustainability within the Hair &amp;amp; Beauty Curriculum

A key finding through our events and work-shops was the need to include sustainability issues within the qualifications and curriculum for Hair &amp;amp; Beauty. Academic practitioners, educators and hairdressers felt the importance of including these key issues during learning and training for young hairdressers, early on in their careers, which will enable them take it forward in their professional work. HABIA , who are a project partner, have confirmed that they will use the findings of this study to inform the National Occupational Standards review for Hairdressing, Barbering and African type hair, during 2013. 



4. Innovative bottom-up approach to reach and educate members of the public

A key finding in this study was the effectiveness of hairdressers in acting as 'diffusers of PEB information' to the members of the public. We devised customer survey cards which included a short anonymous survey consisting of 4 questions, which we asked the participating salons to get their clients to fill in. The data was collected over a period of four-six months and different coloured cards were used (consisting of the same questions) one for 'before' and 'after' the events. The questions are shown below:





1. With respect to hair care at home, are your practices influenced by your experiences at the hairdresser e.g. in terms of how long to dry or rinse your hair, what hair products to use etc.?



2. Do you consider environmental issues in relation to hair care such as energy use in drying/styling hair, water consumption and toxicity of hair care products? 



3. Was there any indication of such issues being considered in your visit to the hairdresser today? 



4. Would you like the hairdresser to consider such issues? 



The responses and analysis of data show a significant difference in clients' responses from 'before' and 'after' the events indicating the hairdressers themselves have taken on board and felt motivated enough by our events to implement changes within their salons as well as model PEBs and talk about them to their clients. In particular with respect to question 2, an ANOVA revealed that customers who completed the customer cards prior to the intervention were significantly less likely to consider environmental issues in relation to hair care (M = 2.18, SD = .94, n = 474) than customers completing the survey after the intervention (M = 2.57, SD = .62, n = 302): F (1, 774) = 40.52, p &amp;lt;.001. With respect to question 3, customers who completed the customer cards prior to the intervention were significantly less likely to consider environmental issues in relation to hair care (M = 1.97, SD = .97, n = 470) than customers completing the survey after the intervention (M = 2.19, SD = .79, n = 302): F (1, 770) = 11.02, p &amp;lt;.001.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Actual/Potential ways for this research to be put to use:

1. Energy &amp;amp; Environmental Audits for Salons

Case studies cited at our workshop, including many ways the salons have made remarkable reduction in its energy consumption and product waste and also significant savings financially (&amp;pound;3500 per annum) by adopting more eco-aware practices, would serve as a motivating example for small salons and independent hairdressers to take up tips and eco-aware practices, which would directly translate to cost savings for their business. This could be done through a series of simple energy/environmental audits specific for the sector. 

2. Promotion of PEBs and More Greener Salons

The workshops and events served as a platform for discussions between hairdressers, educators, trainers and policy makers on issues around standard setting, for example, reduced amounts of shampoo usage, hair washing, blow drying etc. This has helped identify the gaps in this sector, in relation to the changing needs of this industry in the face of the economic recession and the larger issue of sustainability of small businesses. Through examples of cost savings and resource efficiency, salons and hairdressers can be educated on the importance of promotion of PEBs leading to greener salons. 

The TEDx talk by Dr. Denise Baden, on Hairdressers and Sustainability (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mP0gnSSAhI) video is expected to be used as a resource for the hairdressers, introducing them to sustainability issues. 



3. Embedding Sustainability within the Curriculum

The importance of embedding sustainability within the hairdressing curriculum, has been highlighted as a key finding through this study. The workshops provided a platform for all stakeholders across this sector (educators, trainers, independent hairdressers, suppliers, etc.) to discuss and identify the gaps in this sector. The need to include sustainability issues, within training and within the curriculum for the Hair &amp;amp; Beauty qualifications were unanimously agreed by all as this leads to change in behaviours/attitudes towards sustainability, energy and resource efficiency issues, within the trainees and early career hairdressers, who will then take it forward into their professional careers. This has led to a future collaborative project between University of Southampton and VTCT, UK's leading qualifications awarding agency to look at developing bespoke Environmental Sustainability modules for this sector and to 'train the trainers' in achieving successful delivery of these modules to future hairdressers. 



4. Development of innovative eco-products for the hair &amp;amp; beauty industry

The impact of this project could lead to more demand for eco-friendly products, such as more organic hair care products, products similar to 'thermal caps' which replace the energy intensive hood-dryer, biodegradable eco-towels, such as 'Easy-dry', more efficient water products such as tap-aerators, shower heads etc., more energy efficient hair dryers and other products for this industry. Suppliers of these products would see increased sales through increase in demand. 


 Potential to replicate in other SME sectors.

There is potential to replicate this innovative bottom-up approach to other energy intensive SME sectors, such as the printing industry (use of high energy and chemicals) or the hospitality and catering sector. There would be an imperative need to involve the policy makers and National bodies for these sectors, as well as the local authorities and educational institutions to ensure training and practice go hand-in-hand.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C03C780A-F87E-4F6C-A954-2D9895109183</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8016265861.70519377594a7c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mP0gnSSAhI</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Integration of sustainability into National Occupational Standards for Hair and Beauty sector</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>029DA312-60D6-408E-A9E2-D5790E98C0F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sustainability practices have been included in all technical units within the new National Occupational Standards for hairdressing and beauty (2015). For example as a result of our research and input they now no longer recommend shampooing twice as the default recommendation, and now recommend shampooing once as the default, and twice only if the hair type/condition demands it. This effectively cuts the carbon footprint, energy and water consumption associated with hair-washing by almost half, saving time and money and reducing water pollution as well as energy and water savings. This also has positive health and safety implications as many shampoos contain harsh, toxic ingredients so reduced shampoo use reduces risk of skin complaints and improves hair condition in most cases.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dfdec3062ae3.80966045</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.habia.org/standards-qualifications/national-occupational-standards-nos</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EEB4FA45-61F7-4E2B-9B4B-C42CD4069B2E</gtr:id><gtr:title>What hairdressers can tell us about sustainability</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/040053a6fd07ab092179b911e18aa028"><gtr:id>040053a6fd07ab092179b911e18aa028</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baden, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f83cb5e9764.94566556</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2DCBA7C8-24E1-48F1-856C-8DE27864F5F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Applying Behavioural Theory to the Challenge of Sustainable Development: Using Hairdressers as Diffusers of More Sustainable Hair-Care Practices</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Business Ethics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1afc1458650a3a43394fdbd1c4e7fa51"><gtr:id>1afc1458650a3a43394fdbd1c4e7fa51</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baden D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd5a11359d04.82042763</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A1B9CB9-21DE-48FC-9691-20FCA7BDFF11</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Role of Pro-Environmental Behaviours in Engaging SMEs in CSR- A Study of the Hairdressing Sector,</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b6a667a2fca9ba2a24e8c67aa7cd907f"><gtr:id>b6a667a2fca9ba2a24e8c67aa7cd907f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baden, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f851f402397.87380621</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B3D8B350-2BEF-4059-AF57-3E8A07DCBC10</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging Hairdressers in Pro-environmental Behaviours</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b6a667a2fca9ba2a24e8c67aa7cd907f"><gtr:id>b6a667a2fca9ba2a24e8c67aa7cd907f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baden, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f837cb2e7f3.09412034</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7202B0D0-61D8-4A03-91CE-881119E0DBCB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging SMEs in Pro-Environmental Behaviours : Innovative Sustainability Solutions for the Hairdressing Sector</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8f1a3dacb00f867b9f9abbb2e1bab559"><gtr:id>8f1a3dacb00f867b9f9abbb2e1bab559</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prasad, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f8418196f73.21887044</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>155399F5-FB7C-492C-865D-A23B503923B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging SMEs in Pro-Environmental Behaviours : A high-impact study of Sustainability solutions for the Hairdressing Industry</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b6a667a2fca9ba2a24e8c67aa7cd907f"><gtr:id>b6a667a2fca9ba2a24e8c67aa7cd907f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baden, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f84cb3e4f29.29260551</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F05D31A2-F884-4973-A831-9C85F781882C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inspirational Guide for the Implementation of PRME: UK and Ireland Edition</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1afc1458650a3a43394fdbd1c4e7fa51"><gtr:id>1afc1458650a3a43394fdbd1c4e7fa51</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baden D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f82bfba3f33.17707463</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J010375/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp;
