No other product at present is delivering this essential service, thus contributing to UK leadership in this field. Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, which contains a high-volume of recent and historical data on plants (over 7 million specimens), has become a hub for plant Red List assessment activity and innovation. Furthermore, as a result of advanced data capture techniques e.g. digitisation of specimen collections (Global Plants Initiative), a deluge of species occurrence data now exists - see also the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). However very few tools have been built to harness this primary data for secondary outputs such as extinction risk assessments. These assessments lead to conservation action and will safeguard species for the future, leading to the long term persistence of ecosystems that are vital for human health, wellbeing and economic growth. To ensure that the community can address growing challenges such as predicting the impact of climate change on species distributions, it is necessary to make further enhancements to GeoCAT and fully release it. 

In relation to the remit of our institution, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew's mission is: To inspire and deliver science-based plant conservation worldwide, enhancing the quality of life. Specifically, Kew is committed to identifying species of plants at greatest threat of extinction in order to guide conservation policy (Convention on Biological Diversity 2020 - Target 12, Global Strategy for Plant Conservation - Target 2) and action (in situ conservation, seed banking and propagation). 

GeoCAT is a user friendly product that makes light demands from the user, unlike statistical or GIS software that demand a high technical overhead. GeoCAT works in areas where internet connectivity is poor and requires very little experience and has therefore proven to be a valuable tool as part of capacity building projects for our global conservation partners. GeoCAT offers a consistent, transparent and data driven analytical method that can be used to provide baselines in threat status of species from which changes and trends can be monitored.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The enhancements and improvements proposed will enable rapid Red List assessment of large quantities of species - not only restricted to plants. Although the IUCN Red List contains 70,000+ species, it remains incomplete by a large margin with only approximately 5% of described organisms assessed. The rapid assessment of species with GeoCAT will lead to a more comprehensive Red List, indicating potential priorities for policy and conservation action. It will also help fulfil specific goals such as a conservation assessment for all plants by 2020 (Global Strategy for Plant Conservation - Target 2). 

GeoCAT will also make re-assessments of species easier and quicker thereby contributing directly to policy mechanisms such as the Red List Index (Convention on Biological Diversity 2020 - Target 12). As GeoCAT is open source the code can be downloaded and modified thereby allowing the user community to directly contribute to innovation and improvements in the tool. 

A key enhancement will be the harvesting of data from multiple sources. GeoCAT already links to primary sources such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and Flickr images. Links will be implemented for further data sources such as the citizen science projects iSpot (led by the Open University), iNatualist and Project Noah as well as other image platforms e.g. Picassa. 

Future planned innovations for GeoCAT include species distribution modelling and climate change impact modelling. These are key analyses that can help support Red List assessment (Davis et al. 2012 PLOS), but will be useful for other ecological studies. At a later stage the services of the JASMIN and CEMS clusters will assist the climate change modelling module planned for GeoCAT. In addition, plans are in place to develop other aspects of extinction risk modelling and incorporate these into GeoCAT, thus contributing and advancing this field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81843</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>United Nations (UN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)</gtr:department><gtr:description>EU BON/WCMC</gtr:description><gtr:id>BFA3F121-18BD-4C5D-AE6B-1A0AF91E2CF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Building on the success of the NERC release further funding for the tool has been granted to IUCN/WCMC under the EU BON funding umbrella to develop the tool further.

Please provide a brief summary.
The tool had a public release in March 2014 to a general audience, but the impacts during its development (before and during the award) have been far reaching. 
1. Two other data sources have been added and the number of users has been greatly increasing which has added value to natural history collections by increasing their effectiveness, access and usefulness.
2. Increasing the impact and usefulness of citizen science collection, through the addition of data sources from INaturalist and Picasa (Google images), as well as the existing services from Flickr.
3. Increasing the effectiveness, access and usefulness of social media for conservation and species observations, by using iNaturalist, Picasa and Flickr for species observations
4. Our web analytics show the Number of unique users is over 8,300 since 1st April 2014, which has shown a 60% increase in the last 10 months. Each user spending on average 4 minutes with the tool.
5. Our web analytics suggests we regularly have 100's of users with over 60 thousand page views and most are returning visitors. The majority of users are from Brisbane, Panama, Brno, Edinburgh and London.
6. GeoCAT has now been cited 155 times in the scientific literature (over 100 time since the NERC sponsored release one year and two months ago) and assuming two to ten assessments, is carried per publication indicates well over 312 - 1500 assessments using GeoCAT to calculate range based metrics for Red Listing. Furthermore, 209 assessments have referenced use of GeoCAT on the IUCN Red List.
7. Assessment have ranged well beyond plants to other groups in the terrestrial and marine environments
8. GeoCAT is being used by IUCN Red List Unit staff during training sessions and it is recognised as one of a suite of mapping tools used for Red Listing. 
We will continue to develop the training material including screencasts to promote the use of this tool which will increase its reach and impact for scientists, conservationists, educators and the general public in the future. Also we envisage that the open source tool and algorithms will allow the research to be taken further by others as well as this research group (as the EUBON funding shows).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E62A233A-EE5E-4A0D-A88E-6C42EB5ABF1D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cd9ccb80e72.07744512</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research grant was for the development and public release of GeoCAT (Geospatial Conservation Assessment Tool).

Major achievement to date (February 2016) are:
1) Several public releases of tool from beta to a stable version in March 2014, with many bugs fixed
2) The tool has been coded and enhanced allowing improved research methods and usability. The following features have been implemented within this period of development:
o Methodology and interface developed to handle multiple species - a highly requested feature from users.
o Other occurrence data sources have be added including the citizen Science project iNaturalist and Picasa images
o The ability to record temporal decline of distributions for example based on deforestation
o Options to display environmental data from other mapping sources have been added e.g. web mapping server, CartoDB, Google Fusion Tables and KML, which can be easily displayed in the map interface. Also addition of deforestation layer is available
o Behind the scenes improvement for speed, data integration and standardisation
3) Increased research capacity generated from training for specialists. GeoCAT has been demonstrated at many times (at least 50 times since March 2014) at IUCN training courses as well as at Kew Gardens.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The initial tool (Version 1) has was developed and released in March 2014, we have been working on and with continue to improve training, online help and snagging. 
Beyond the end of the funding this tool has continued to evolve and as it is open source the code and algorithms can be used by other groups, the GitHub repository has already been branched nine times (N.B. GitHub is an online repository distribution network of code, which others can freely download or fork and therefore develop themselves and resubmit). Building on the success of the NERC release further funding for the tool has been granted to IUCN/WCMC under the EU BON funding umbrella to develop the tool further. We are in talks with IUCN/WCMC on this development but we would envision that the GeoCAT will have the potential to develop in the following areas:
? Further Integration with other systems i.e. providing an occurrence output file compatible with IUCN's Species Information Service
? Addition of new algorithms i.e. minimum area of occupancy, fragmentation index, vegetation change, population change trends, Species distribution modelling coupled with climate change modelling
?
