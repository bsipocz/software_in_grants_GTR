MoPowered is applying to the TSB for support in delivering Version 2.0 of the platform during 2013.
MoPowered is special because it dramatically lowers the barriers to entry and costs for a merchant business that wishes to establish a mobile selling channel. MoPowered?s live operations platform provides merchants with a fully hosted and managed solution on a software-as-a-service basis; and MoPowered mobile systems are fully aligned with a client?s existing business systems for order management and payment.
There are c 100,000 online merchants in the UK of which c 75% are yet to mobilise their offering. This creates the opportunity to deliver significant growth and to demonstrate that the UK is a world leader in m-commerce. MoPowered already has a portfolio of 60 merchants ranging from enterprise retailers like Next plc and the Bestseller Fashion Group, to smaller mid-tier retailers like Proviz and Equichoice. Links to the SME solutions are:

- http://equichoice.mopowered.co.uk/
MoPowered processed over 1,427,00 mobile transactions in 2012 (685,000 in 2011). The plan is to have in excess of 200 merchants on the platform by the end of 2013, with significant growth in the UK and internationally in 2014.
The technology has attracted channel partnerships with many of the key players in the payments and eCommerce industry which is allowing it to become increasingly attractive to slightly smaller merchants. In conjunction with their expertise in mobile technologies, this allows MoPowered to better align with the merchants, developers and payment service provider communities to be seen as the most suitable partner.
In 2013, MoPowered is looking to build out the capabilities of the MoPowered platform that will:
- speed up the process for deploying m-commerce sites;
- increase the security and speed of checkout and payments; and
- enable MoPowered to operate across all the operating systems (i.e. iOS, Android, Windows and BlackBerry).
MoBank Limited is a private company registered in the UK.
