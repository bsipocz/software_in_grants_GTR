There are strong cultural beliefs that the pursuit of materialistic values - money, fame, material goods - leads to a happy, satisfied life. Yet, the research literature provides theories and evidence to the contrary: strong endorsement of materialistic values is linked to lower well-being. Materialistic individuals have lower personal well-being, are less likely to engage with community/environmentally friendly activities, suffer more dysfunctional consumer behaviours, and have less positive personal and social relationships. There is also recent evidence that materialism may lead children to perform less well in school.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This existing, large research literature needs systematic evaluation through meta-analysis, a higher-order form of data analysis that assesses the link between materialism and well-being across all studies containing relevant, quantifiable measures. It provides a systematic assessment of the actual strength of this relationship. Second, it investigates the link with different dimensions of well-being not examined together previously: personal, environmental/community, financial, interpersonal, and performance. Finally, it assesses factors that increase, diminish, or help explain the strength of the materialism-well-being link.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Given low well-being, environmental degradation, and economic difficulties, this analysis helps identify avenues for intervention and positive change.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38110</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Knox College</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Materialism and well-being</gtr:description><gtr:id>09C5610D-133F-4DA8-ACA9-F6F863AD7D91</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b955e0ceb955e0e2-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The research has strengthened collaboration with Tim Kasser, a leading researcher in the area of materialism and well-being, and he has been a co-author on two of the conference papers.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Limits of materialism - Invited keynote address at Sustainable Living Dissemination Event in London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B9DC0534-1800-481E-8B36-533FD33E77DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was intended to disseminate findings from the Sustainable Lifestyles Research Programme, headed by Prof. Tim Jackson, not only to academics, but to policy makers, research organisations, and business/industry.

Our innovative research showcase had three aims: a) develop awareness, policy, and advocacy; b) promote networking; and c) build interdisciplinary research. The event consisted of two parts. In the first, we presented our main findings on how a consumerist orientation impacts well-being, and particularly children's well-being. In the second, we hosted a multi-disciplinary panel discussion with leading academics, policy-makers, and campaigners to address the issue of whether a less consumerist orientation in children can help to support both well-being and sustainable consumption in the future. Our high-powered panel included:

Prof. Richard Wilkinson, whose work on inequalities and well-being is best known through his book The Spirit Level;
Saamah Abdallah, Senior Researcher on Well-Being at the New Economics Foundation;
Prof. Jonathan Chapman, whose interdisciplinary work on sustainable design is showcased in Emotionally Durable Design;
Prof. David Buckingham, whose media and communications research is summarised in The Material Child;
Prof. Andy Stirling, at the Science and Technology Policy Unit at the University of Sussex, who authored From Sustainability, through Diversity to Transformation; and
Prof. Agnes Nairn, engaged in research and campaigning work regarding marketing to children, who led the UNICEF-funded project on the role of materialism and inequality in Child Well-being in the UK, Spain, and Sweden.
The panel discussion was informed by questions generated by the audience after our research presentation, which included parents, educational policy makers, researchers and academics, as well as campaigners (e.g., LOKA, Child Eyes, Beat). The research presentation and panel discussion were filmed, and we are in the process of generating two video clip synopses to be featured on the project website. The feedback we collected on the day was enthusiastic. 100% of those who completed the feedback from enjoyed the event, 75% reported that they benefitted from the research presentation, and 62% were very positive about the opportunities to engage in discussion. Here are some examples of qualitative comments: &amp;quot;Awesome. Better than Radio 4!&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Wide range of views from different disciplines. Panel discussion very good choice and range&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Interactivity, comments of audience were linked to statements of the panel&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2917261489.58994252b352d78</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/psychology/consumercultureproject/overview/showcase</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What is the price of consumer culture?

world, are characterised by a consumer culture that highly profiles the pursuit 

of wealth and expensive possessions as an important life goal, and a 

pathway to a happy, satisfied life. Individuals differ in their endorsement of 

such materialistic values, and the stronger people's endorsement of 

materialistic values, the more they believe that the acquisition of money and 

material goods is a central life goal, and that money and material goods are a 

prime indicator of success and fame, as well as a key pathway to happiness 

and positive self-definition (Dittmar, 2008; Kasser &amp;amp; Kanner, 2004). 

This talk focuses on psychological research examining how individuals' 

endorsement of materialistic values is linked to their well-being. It briefly 

summarises different frameworks theorizing this link, and then presents 

findings from three recent or ongoing studies: (a) a meta-analysis of research 

on the link between materialism and personal well-being, (b) a two-wave 

longitudinal survey examining whether changes in materialism are 

accompanied by changes in well-being, carried out just after the economic 

collapse in Iceland, and (c) a study investigating buying motives as mediators 

of the link between materialism and well-being in UK and Indian respondents.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5523354295.1972722ab85686</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A9A99CA-79D3-4764-B674-0C9DDD86B505</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social psychology and policymaking: Past neglect, future promise</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Public Policy Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684"><gtr:id>7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfa5fa587f30b9</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6920C80-0A4A-4420-9526-7D6404657391</gtr:id><gtr:title>The pursuit of materialistic values results in poorer well-being : a meta-analysis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7648c98cae3de1a60b9919d4792f7939"><gtr:id>7648c98cae3de1a60b9919d4792f7939</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Helga Dittmar (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_3772273392cb416f5a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>94FFDB88-E6AA-49AD-B89D-401384E96639</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pursuit of materialistic values may reduce community-oriented values and behaviour : a meta-analysis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7648c98cae3de1a60b9919d4792f7939"><gtr:id>7648c98cae3de1a60b9919d4792f7939</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Helga Dittmar (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2620481715cb41671c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F2EE5C1-F190-4914-9641-8AE7EC9B1D4E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The relationship between materialistic values and environmental attitudes and behaviors: A meta-analysis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Environmental Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1f99c62ffbfbb37e7df6dad7c3382daf"><gtr:id>1f99c62ffbfbb37e7df6dad7c3382daf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hurst M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545caca6315573.24234114</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2A1DFBEC-B106-4025-AD57-2FD4E0C6DD77</gtr:id><gtr:title>The pursuit of materialistic values results in lower well-being : a meta-analysis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7648c98cae3de1a60b9919d4792f7939"><gtr:id>7648c98cae3de1a60b9919d4792f7939</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Helga Dittmar (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2326743673cb416b86</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-4020</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H036547/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
