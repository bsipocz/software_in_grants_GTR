The object of the work is to present the history of the later Russian empire as a coda rather than an overture. Although it would obviously be wrong to say that there was no social change whatever in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Russian Empire, the extent of social change was less, and its effect less destructive, than we might be tempted to suppose in the light of the revolutions of 1917. Hypotheses underpinning the research include the following: modes of employment diversified only slowly in the Russian Empire; regional centrifugalism was insufficient to threaten the unity of the empire; although population increased, families continued to operate in traditional ways; education reached a higher proportion of the empire's inhabitants, but still a relatively small minority; neither geographical nor social mobility was increasing very rapidly; 'communality' sometimes took new forms, but continued to prevail over intimations of individuality; belief systems, on the whole, remained backward-looking; and insofar as social change was nonetheless taking place in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Russia, countervailing official interventions of one kind or another tended to be equal to it. Why then did the Russian Empire collapse? Because it could not cope with the strain of warfare, and particularly with the social strains of World War One. In short, the research centres on the question whether the collapse of the Russian empire in 1917 had a long gestation. It proposes that social revolution was not always imminent in Russia. Although social harmony may not have been much in evidence either, social equilibrium - an equal contest between social change and social control - characterized the greater part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. War punctuated the equilibrium.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32537</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I am still working on the subject funded by this grant. My object is to show that nineteenth-century Russian society was developing rapidly, but not rapidly enough to bring about the revolutionary upheaval of 1917 without the very substantial additional impact on Russian society of the First World War. I am committed to a single major outcome which I have not yet completed. It was due to go to the publisher to whom I am contracted (Oxford University Press) in autumn 2014, but serious illness (hospitalization, endless tests) has necessitated delay. No new date has yet been assigned to the contract; the publisher is to contact me early in 2015 to see how I am placed. Meanwhile, I have published an article early in 2014 about a well-informed mid-C19th commentator who severely criticized the way in which the tsarist government abolished serfdom. His argument was that, although the end of serfdom was very welcome, the legislation on the subject which the regime put in place had the effect of slowing down the development of large-scale agriculture in Russia, i.e. it promoted social development but at a relatively slow rate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I expect my findings to be controversial when they are published in full. It is usual to say something like 'The society of the later Russian Empire was falling apart at an ever-increasing rate'. I accept that it was changing, but not rapidly enough to produce the revolutions of 1917. I am attempting to rehabilitate the argument that, from the point of view of a social historian is concerned, the First World War generated much more rapid change in Russia than the period (or any part of the period) 1796-1914.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD65A989-901D-49B2-9943-B8C352C0E968</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54639c466aaf69.63883169</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F28602D-861C-4179-827E-9C380EDEA332</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Anglo-Russian Critic of the Abolition of Serfdom</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Slavonic and East European Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2b61ac71e1388c40c5ec7c26ca3753e1"><gtr:id>2b61ac71e1388c40c5ec7c26ca3753e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>David Saunders</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54639525b570e2.13708395</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H005307/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
