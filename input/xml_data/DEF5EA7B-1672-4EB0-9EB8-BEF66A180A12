By investigating how this protein protects these cells, we aim to understand what role it might have in human skin cancer. 
Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) play fundamental roles in biology, influencing how cells behave during development, maintenance and repair of the body. They act by binding to specific receptors, one of which, Fgfr2b, is the protein that has this protective role.
Mice lacking Fgfr2b in their skin cells are very susceptible to skin cancer and the aim of this project is to identify why such cells are so prone to developing into tumours. As well as being relevant to cancer research, Fgfr2b is also implicated in developmental abnormalities, thus in addition to addressing questions of fundamental biological interest, our research will address clinically significant problems.
Hopefully, as a result of these studies, new drugs might be designed to stimulate the beneficial actions of these receptors and to have an impact on cancer development in man. 
My group consists of one post-doctoral fellow and one PhD student, and we are all interested in various aspects of Fgf biology. This project grant would fund an additional post-doctoral fellow who would be able to spend three years using our mouse model of skin cancer, together with cell culture approaches, to dissect out the mechanisms by which Fgfr2b protects cells from becoming cancerous.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The epithelial isoform of Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2b) is crucial for normal foetal development with Fgfr2b null mice dying at birth. Using Cre-Lox transgenics to target Fgfr2b deletion, we have shown that mice lacking epidermal Fgfr2b survive into adulthood and are fertile but gradually develop epidermal hyperthickening. By eight months of age, 10% of mutant mice develop spontaneous papillomas, while control littermates never show such lesions. Though bred on a tumour-refractory background, mice lacking epithelial Fgfr2b show exquisite sensitivity to carcinogenic insult, displaying a variety of oncogenic Ha-ras mutations and being highly prone to papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma development. These data demonstrate a role for Fgfr2b during post-natal skin development, a continued requirement for Fgfr2b in adult skin homeostasis, and provide the first example of a tyrosine kinase receptor playing a tumour suppressive role in the skin.
The research objectives of this project are to identify key factors that mediate this tumour-protective effect of Fgfr2b, with the eventual goal of developing targets for treatment and prevention of epithelial cancers. 
We will address two main hypotheses; (1) that keratinocytes lacking Fgfr2b intrinsically are susceptible to carcinogenic insult and (2) that the observed enhanced tumorigenesis results from environmental influences. There are data in the literature supporting each of these possibilities. Fgf-7, an obligate ligand for Fgfr2b, has been shown to upregulate several cytoprotective proteins in keratinocytes; at least one of which has been implicated as preventive in chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. Equally, Fgfr2b may regulate interactions between keratinocytes and skin cells responsible for limiting oncogenic transformation. For example, Dendritic Epidermal T-Cells (DETCs) express ligands for Fgfr2b, such that disrupting their interaction with keratinocytes may result in impaired immune surveillance in the skin. Mice lacking DETCs show enhanced skin carcinogenesis. Our preliminary data indicate Fgfr2b mutant mice display abnormalities both in DETC number and morphology.
Several approaches will be used including; primary keratinocyte culture to assess cell adhesion, signalling, proliferation, survival and response to carcinogenic challenge; in vivo skin carcinogenesis expression profiling and proteomics; and development of an organotypic skin culture model for skin carcinogenesis in which we can validate target molecules using siRNA down-regulation and viral over-expression approaches. Promising candidates will then be investigated further using transgenic mouse models.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>343675</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FGFR2: Oncogene or tumour suppressor</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>E1B8E187-491A-4DFE-80A2-DDE4FCB2F067</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20 min invited talk at Gordon Research Conference on FGFs
