Reserved Occupations in Britain, 1939-1945</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K00011X/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In the lead up to the outbreak of World War Two, the British government began to prepare for military conscription and the parallel control of its manpower resources. In 1938, following discussions between the armed forces, industry and the Ministry of Labour, the government devised a Schedule of Reserved Occupations (SRO) which made provision for 'skilled workpeople who would be required in time of war for the maintenance of necessary production or essential service' to be exempt from enlistment in the armed forces. Statistically, far more men remained on the home front (working in the heavy industries, such as shipbuilding, iron and steel manufacture and coal mining, as well as in 'white collar' occupations, such as the civil service and the medical profession). Yet, to a remarkable degree, the civilian male worker is largely absent from popular and cultural representations of World War Two in Britain whilst the figure of the 'soldier hero' remains predominant. Furthermore, male civilian workers of military age who remained on the home front were often vilified as 'shirkers' who were avoiding military service and were exposed to the discourse of effeminacy surrounding conscientious objectors. Fundamentally, this research project aims to explore the question first articulated by Penny Summerfield in Reconstructing Women's Wartime Lives: 'if wartime heroism and masculinity were embodied in the military man, where did that leave the civilian male worker?' (1998: 119)

This research builds on a pilot study undertaken by the applicants in Falkirk and will explore the extent to which male civilian workers made use of alternative sites of masculinity. For example, the hegemonic wartime discourse of masculinity, that exalted the combatants, potentially clashed with traditional 'hard man' notions of masculinity pre-existent in working class communities. In the latter areas the dominant inter-war discourse stressed the tough, brutal struggle in the workplace to win coal, forge iron and make ships by hard men desensitised to danger and risk. This 'hard man' masculinity may well have been sustained during the war and even been bolstered by it. In contrast, professional men with reserved status may have operated within the framework of 'respectable' or 'tempered' masculinity which also emerged in the inter-war period. 

An examination of reserved occupation workers/civilian male workers is important for three key reasons:

1) To date, there is no single socio-historical study of reserved occupations in Britain. Summerfield (1998) draws attention to the complexities surrounding the status of the male civilian worker whilst Peniston-Bird, in her work on wartime masculinities (2003), touches upon the question of reserved status.Yet no major work has been devoted solely to this topic which remains essentially unexplored. In 2004 Johnston and McIvor (the CI) flagged up the need for 'a systematic oral history of the &amp;quot;reserved occupations&amp;quot;'. Any academic research which looks at the question of male civilian workers on the home front has limited its focus to the role and function of the Home Guard (Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007).

2) There is no current dataset in existence relating directly to the topic of reserved occupations. Whilst it is likely that some interviews with male civilian workers exist within British archival sources it requires dedicated research to locate them. No systematic collecting has been done of those who were civilian workers for the duration of the war, contributing to their cultural invisibility. 

3) The lived experience of those in reserved occupations will soon be lost forever as this generation (now aged 89 and above) die so there is an urgent need to record the testimonies of surviving civilian male workers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a number of 'users' who will be interested in and will benefit from the proposed research:

The interviewees: Over the last decade there has been an upsurge in interest in commemorating the 'forgotten groups' of World War Two Britain, reflected in the recent issuing of commemorative badges to groups such as the Bevin Boys and Land Army members, and Heritage Lottery-funded initiatives such as Veterans Reunited. Those who served in reserved occupations remain a historically-neglected group whose contribution to the national war effort has not been explored or critically examined - a gap which our research proposes to address. There are indications of the timeliness and topicality of our proposed project. For example, Falkirk Council recently held a ceremony in which local men and women who served in reserved occupations were awarded the Freedom of Falkirk Council Area, the highest civic honour which the Council can bestow. Recipients at this event clearly valued the recognition of their wartime activity. In November 2008, to facilitate the planning and direction of our proposed research, we initiated a pilot project in the Falkirk region with reserved status workers, interviewing four men and one woman (later undertaking another two interviews in Glasgow). As with Falkirk Council, we will work in partnership with other local authorities to develop our project on reserved occupations. Contacts with Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils have been made. A positive aspect of the research is the sense of validation given to interview participants. Pilot interviews indicate that interviewees found the process of reminiscence and reflection on their wartime work a rewarding and enjoyable experience. Following strict ethical guidelines, interview transcripts are returned to interviewees for comment and correction. We have found that this is another positive outcome for interviewees, providing them with a printed record of their history to share with their families.

Policy-makers within national, local and devolved government: In addition to the initiative by Falkirk Council, a parliamentary debate in May 2008 underlines the relevance of our proposed research. A request by Labour MP Jon Trickett that those who worked in the mines during the Second World War receive an award 'equivalent to a Bevin Boy badge' resulted in a commitment by the then Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, John Hutton MP, to establish a way to recognise the contribution to the war effort 'not just by the miners, but by those in other reserved occupations, too.' (Hansard 22 May 2008, Vol. 476, col. 381) Our proposed research would, therefore, be of direct benefit to politicians and policy makers within local government, Westminster and the devolved parliaments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who are planning to take forward initiatives on reserved occupations. Currently, there is a huge deficit in academic research on this topic and a lack of information in the public domain. 

The wider public: One of the key mechanisms for identifying suitable interviewees would be via the pensioner associations of different occupational groupings. We would hope to work closely with these agencies and disseminate our findings via these networks. We plan to develop a website containing an overview of the project and, subject to copyright clearance, sample audio, video and written excerpts from interviews, increasing access to the collected material to participants and the wider public. A project blog will be created that will allow us to publish regular updates on the project and related items of interest as a categorised and searchable news feed. The system itself would be hosted on dedicated Enhanced Web Development Service servers at the University of Strathclyde. We would also seek to publicise our work in popular publications such as History Scotland, BBC History Magazine, People's Friend and Scottish Memories.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159562</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) We have conducted fifty six interviews - the first concerted effort to collect interviews nationwide with reserved men. 

2) We have amassed a wealth of autobiographies, posters, archived interviews, films, archival records and parliamentary papers.

3) Our interviews suggest that the consensus that civilian men were emasculated is far too simplistic. Our findings reveal there is much more complexity. WW2 provided the opportunity for civilian men to be in employment and earn high wages, which bolstered, rather than undermined masculinity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) We are publishing a book with MUP entitled Men in Reserve which will further academic discussions about masculinities, war, commoration etc. 

2) There have been spin-off articles and book chapters. (Pattinson's article accepted by Gender and History; McIvor &amp;amp; Robb's individual chapters in Pattinson &amp;amp; Robb's co-edited book on Masculinities in WW2 to be published by Palgrave.) 

3) We have presenting at national and international events including NACBS (Minneapolis - Pattinson, Robb &amp;amp; McIvor), PCCBS (Las Vegas - Pattinson &amp;amp; Robb), SHS (Portsmouth - Pattinson, Robb &amp;amp; McIvor), IHR (London - Pattinson &amp;amp; Robb), University of Strathclyde (Pattinson &amp;amp; Robb) &amp;amp; University of Kent (Pattinson).

4) There is a potential for follow-up funding to encourage more public enagegement - Falkirk gave civilian workers freedom of the city. No other places have done this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>88361796-5695-4D42-8AA6-1D703160C0A1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545240e71bedf3.57676719</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08E3263F-C1BA-4722-9D8D-3D28AB38D4B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Men in Reserve: British Civilian Masculinities in the Second World War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c15170f446ae221fc482e294d8731c3"><gtr:id>7c15170f446ae221fc482e294d8731c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Juliette Pattinson</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-5261-0069-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a584b24c46.81776224</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB67B30C-06CC-463C-89C0-1018DF28DB8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Shirkers', 'Scrimjacks' and 'scrimshanks'?: British civilian masculinity and reserved occupations, 1914-1945</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gender and History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c15170f446ae221fc482e294d8731c3"><gtr:id>7c15170f446ae221fc482e294d8731c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Juliette Pattinson</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a5d7530e00.25603894</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K00011X/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>03B74E2E-C5F1-44E1-BCE1-04FE5D560C76</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/K00011X/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>233762.84</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>3EC6474E-04B2-45C8-86E9-B489CE187C91</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/K00011X/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>159562.93</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
