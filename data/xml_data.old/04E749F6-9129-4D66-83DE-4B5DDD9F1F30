Thailand</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/F009275/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The rise of state societies is one of the major transitions in human prehistory. In mainland Southeast Asia, the origins of state society share similarities with many of the classic states studied worldwide: a background of simpler, loosely-integrated agrarian communities, some of which may have herded livestock or even still hunted and gathered. As people grew in number, specialised in their occupations, and agglomerated over many generations, state societies arose among these locally dense, interdependent populations. \n\nEarly states were often hierarchical, but they were also heterogeneous, often cosmopolitan, and composed of specialised socioeconomic groups that both competed and interacted in ways that manifested the state itself. People may have differentiated themselves across multiple dimensions: social spheres, occupations, residential neighbourhoods, and common family links. Among these, it is crucial to understand the role of kinship, which may have been the earliest organising principle of complex societies. As both population size and the scale of social differences grew, differences may have depended less and less on kinship ties, or, alternatively, come to be inherited along kinship lines. In the archaeology of early states, however, such phenomena have been very difficult to study because artefacts and other material remains are indirect evidence with respect to the migrations and differences of people.\n\nWhat is needed is direct evidence, from the prehistoric individuals themselves. Within the wider collaborative archaeological project on the origins of Angkor, I seek to measure isotopes in archaeological skeletons from the site of Ban Non Wat, in the Mun Valley of northeast Thailand. Here, the rise of social complexity may have occurred in a context that was often matrilineal (female-centred), which is unusual among pre-state societies. Ban Non Wat features the largest site-sample of human remains yet discovered in prehistoric Southeast Asia. With over six hundred excavated skeletons, ranging from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, the sample provides an unprecedented chance to investigate changes in kinship and social differentiation from simple agrarian origins to a complex, hierarchical and specialised society, becoming part of the Angkor civilization. \n\nIn samples of tooth enamel, my Ph.D. students and I will measure isotopes (chemical elements with different atomic masses) from hundreds of human skeletons from Ban Non Wat. Strontium isotopes, which differ from place to place, indicate the geographic area from which each person obtained his/her diet during childhood (when the enamel was forming). Carbon and nitrogen isotopes, which we will measure in both bone collagen and tooth enamel, inform about diet. Using radiocarbon dating to refine the chrononology, we will investigate how immigration patterns and diet changed through time, how these changes may have differed among women and men, and how they related to burial positions and artefacts. Such patterns serve as clues to the specialization and/or group affiliation of each individual. \n\nBy first identifying locals versus non-locals, we will identify basic aspects of kinship, particularly the immigration of women (patrilocality) versus men (matrilocality) into Ban Non Wat. In addition, by collaborating with colleagues from University of Otago, we will identify correlations through time between the geographic origins of individuals (isotopes), genetic relatedness (skeletal and dental traits), social distinctions (burial treatments, artefacts) and quality of life (skeletal biology) of individuals and groups. In this unique part of the prehistoric world, these multiple lines of evidence will provide an entirely new perspective on crucial social aspects of early state origin, including changes in social differentiation, migration, and kinship through time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128260</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Otago</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Anatomy</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mobility and community differentiation in the Bronze Age of Myanmar</gtr:description><gtr:id>204E63DE-9914-47BE-B468-FB9A6F857EA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Together with Dr. T.O.

Our project aimed to apply isotopic analysis to hundreds of archaeological skeletons from the Mun Valley of Thailand, in order to document the development of human society from simple agrarian origins to a complex, heterarchical and specialised society, culminating in state civilization. 

We hypothesised that during this transition toward state society, changes in kinship and social differentiation would develop alongside them. In prehistoric archaeology, kinship has been difficult to study because material culture can only reveal it indirectly, if at all. What is needed is direct evidence, from the prehistoric individuals themselves. 

To track prehistoric mobility, we measured isotopes and trace elements in archaeological tooth enamel to characterise the geographic origin of diet during childhood, when the enamel was forming. Our isotopic evidence for matrilocal kinship during the transition to agriculture is supported by genetic and archaeological evidence. Methodologically, our isotopic analysis of tooth enamel is compatible with molecular anthropology and new genetic evidence for coexisting populations. We also collaborate to consider how Neolithic diet and disease responses may have shaped vulnerability to disease today. 

In the wider view, this project has related archaeological evidence to human adaptation and environmental change in Neolithic societies to contemporary discourse on climate change. We model the Neolithic as a coupled social-natural system, focusing on the environmental and social impacts of early farming, niche construction, land tenure, specialization and emergence of social inequality. We use this evidence as part of a wider story, regarding the long prehistory of sustainability. One example is our review of social tipping points and Earth systems dynamics is in Frontiers in Environmental Science. The project results also feature prominently in my public lectures on prehistoric sustainability and I received a modest university grant for sustainability in my teaching at Bristol University.


Using multiple lines of evidence from both the field and the laboratory, my future students and I would aim to characterise migration, kinship and social differentiation from hunter-gatherer origins to during the rise of state-level society, in sites of Southeast Asia. The research uses isotopic analysis of archaeological skeletons to investigate a remarkable series of transformations in the past 10,000 years, from a world of dispersed, mobile hunter-gatherers, to one of closely-settled farmers, leading (in certain places) to the earliest state societies. These developments are especially significant in mainland Southeast Asia, where subsistence varied over time and space, and kinship systems often appear matri-centric along several lines of evidence (genetic, linguistic, archaeological). Over time, as population size and the scale of social differences grew, differences may have depended decreasingly on kinship ties, or, alternatively, come to be inherited along kinship lines. These regional-scale results, together with our site-specific studies,, have informed the modelling of human genetic diversity in early Southeast Asia via sex-biased post-marital residence systems.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AC592490-562C-4F26-AF5D-ECCFFA030200</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cd6de9ca8b4.82278725</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>* Overall for the Upper Mun River Valley of northeast Thailand, our isotopic results indicate that, from the Neolithic, culturally-mediated choices led to significantly different diet and material culture at sites within a ten kilometer radius. This evidence for cultural pluralism appears long before the advent of state society at Angkor, as differences between groups arose over many generations.



* Our isotopic evidence from Ban Non Wat, by far the largest cemetery sample of this study (over 100 adult skeletons) reveals high levels of cultural diversity in prehistoric Thailand. This diversity occurs in terms of human mobility, diet and subsistence strategy. This diversity evolves considerably over time with the intensification of rice agriculture and craft specialisation that occurs during the long transition from Neolithic to Iron Age.



* Our isotope results from the Iron Age site of Noen U Loke (c. 300BC - 500AD) contributed to our evidence for intrinsic changes in social complexity, new technologies and population growth in the Upper Mun River Valley. This evidence for intrinsic population growth (as opposed to extrinsic, due to immigration) at Noen U Loke is a crucial component of our emergent view of social complexity as developing within Southeast Asia, rather than through the traditional view of 'Indianization,&amp;quot; or of large-scale immigration from the pre-existing state society of China.



* Our isotope results from Ban Lum Khao, which correlated nicely with pottery types in the burials and sex of the skeleton, indicate that social identity, drawn from village of origin, was conveyed by material culture. Although Ban Lum Khao was probably an egalitarian community, our evidence suggests that distinct social identities were already emerging in the Upper Mun River Valley before 1000 B.C. 



* New radiocarbon dates at Ban Non Wat facilitated by this grant has provided a revolutionary new chronological framework for prehistoric Southeast Asia. As a result of the new dates, Neolithic practice now begins in the second millennium and hierarchical state-forming activity is dated to a 'starburst' around 1000 BC, which is right about the time we see solid evidence for social diversification from our skeletal-isotopic results.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our isotopic evidence from Ban Non Wat, by far the largest cemetery sample of this study (over 100 adult skeletons) reveals high levels of cultural diversity in prehistoric Thailand. These isotope data are available in our peer-reviewed journal publications, and thus provide a very useful baseline for all other archaeologists working in this region of Southeast Asia. 

Our new radiocarbon dates at Ban Non Wat provide a revolutionary new chronological framework for prehistoric Southeast Asia.

 Although this project was focused on mainland Southeast Asia, the techniques are widely applicable. Generally, by using isotopes to identify locals versus non-locals, basic aspects of kinship can be identified, such as the movement of women (patrilocality) or men (matrilocality) into new communities. In addition, we can identify correlations through time between the geographic origins of individuals (isotopes), genetic relatedness (skeletal and dental traits), social distinctions (burial treatments, artefacts) and quality of life (skeletal biology) of individuals and groups.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E7997636-0D19-432F-AEF6-5F45FCA19B9A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1547683041.1215155775b103c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset contains strontium, carbon and oxygen isotope measurements from the tooth enamel of 34 adults from Noen U-Loke, an Iron Age site (c. 300BC - 500AD) in the Upper Mun River Valley, northeast Thailand.
