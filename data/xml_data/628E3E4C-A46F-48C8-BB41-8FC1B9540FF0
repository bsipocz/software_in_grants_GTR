They have persisted through numerous major environmental perturbations, including the formation of global hothouse conditions in the Late Cretaceous and Eocene (and associated cooling events), the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, and post-Eocene global cooling trends. How have they responded to these past environmental changes? What can we learn from their history that can be applied to understand past and future responses of biota to long-term environmental change? Chelonians inhabit all three major global realms (marine, freshwater, terrestrial) and chelonian fossils are exceptionally common, have a well-established taxonomy, and their habitat preferences are well-understood. For all of these reasons, chelonians are a near-ideal model system for studying the biotic response of cold-blooded vertebrates to long-term environmental change. This is because we can compare groups characteristic of different habitats and regions as a replicated natural experiment to understand the differential effects of long-term change on ecological subsets of global diversity. Moreover, chelonians are globally threatened, and study of their past reactions to major environmental events will provide the baseline information needed to help predict their possible responses to projected future climate change.

The proposed project is completely novel. We will build a comprehensive database of all chelonian occurrences in the Mesozoic and Paleogene (220-23 million years ago). We will use these data to construct the first-ever rigorous estimate of global chelonian diversity during this interval. We will apply standard and newly developed statistical methods to extract the signal of diversity change from noise resulting from uneven sampling or other biases in the fossil record. We will then use these data to understand how chelonian diversity patterns differ among habitats and regions. Do changes in different regions and habitats occur out of phase or do they act together to create the global pattern? 

Most importantly, we will compare the observed diversity patterns with palaeoclimatic data, such as mean annual temperature and precipitation rates, in order to determine if any significant positive (evolutionary radiation or decreased extinction) or negative (decreased origination or increased extinction) changes in chelonian diversity correlate with global or regional environmental perturbations. All of this work will lead to the most detailed understanding of the relationship between chelonian diversity, distribution and climate ever attempted. This will greatly advance our understanding of long-term biotic responses to global change, will be timely in complementing existing work on other groups (primarily mammals), and will provide a deep-time perspective on current biodiversity trends in chelonians and other reptiles. These insights from the fossil record, the only dataset capable of documenting the long-term impacts of climate change, will be of direct relevance to those working on living species. We think that our results will be of major importance to zoologists, conservation biologists, palaeontologists, palaeoclimatologists and macroecologists.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this research will benefit four major groups of stakeholders in the UK and internationally:

1. The international scientific community, primarily those working on long-term responses of organisms to global climate change, specifically vertebrate palaeontologists, zoologists, climate scientists and macroecologists.
2. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including UK and internationally-based conservation charities, and UK government agencies charged with assessing the impact of predicted long-term climate change on biodiversity conservation strategies.
3. The UK public, which has high levels of societal interest in scientific issues relating to both long-term climate change and palaeontology/evolution. 
4. UK-based science educators in schools and colleges, as the proposed project is of direct relevance to topics covered by the National Curriculum, namely biodiversity and the impact of environmental change. 

Impact will be achieved in the following ways:

1. Scientific publication in high-profile international journals and presentations at professional meetings (communication with the academic community, NGOs, government agencies).
2. Popular scientific articles in the membership magazines of NGOs, such as those of the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-UK), in Natural History Museum publications, and elsewhere as invited.
3. A range of public outreach activities aimed a both school groups and the general public to be held in the NHM, in conjunction with the museum's educational specialists. These activities will include: 'Nature Live' events (aimed at the public, school groups), which involve 30 minute presentations with the museum and that allow direct communication between the scientists and audience; formal activity-based education events (for both primary and secondary pupils); and provision of a mobile exhibition ('Hands-on Nature') for use with the NHM public galleries (aimed at the public and primary school groups).
4. Public outreach beyond the NHM will include video-conferencing sessions with school groups around the UK. In addition, the 'Hands-on Nature' exhibit will be suitable for touring at other venues, including public science festivals.
5. NGOs (e.g. WWF-UK, Durrell Foundation, Institute of Zoology [IoZ]) and governmental agency representatives (e.g. DEFRA, Natural England) will be invited to attend a half-day workshop on the results of the project, accompanied by a briefing document on how this research might impact future biodiversity and conservation priorities and policy. WWF-UK and the IoZ have already expressed strong interest in the possible benefits of the proposed research (see Letters of Support).

The NHM is ideally placed to promote the results of the research to an exceptionally wide audience. The museum already has excellent, purpose-built facilities in place to deliver many of these activities and an unmatched track record in communicating science to a diverse set of stakeholders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>117679</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborative discussion - University of California</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE4EF988-A879-46A9-A670-D4D0477CA3EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Amy plans to maintain contact and update Barry with project progress as she develops her palaeo niche models with the turtle data</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b67876d0433.56471937-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Barry was happy to be involved/updated with Amy's project progress and provide physiological modelling results for comparison (when published) which would be complementary to her palaeo niche modelling research</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Amy has had discussions with Dr. Barry Sinervo at University of California, Santa Cruz about his current research on physiological modelling of turtles and climate constraints during the Eocene</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Zoological Society of London (ZSL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborative discussion - Zoological Society London</gtr:description><gtr:id>77D51E5D-344F-45F1-B7B8-1ED8CEC2C091</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Amy is currently in conversation about developing a phyloclimatic niche model using the palaeo turtle distribution data and palaeoclimatic variables with Chris at ZSL.

Understanding the additional impact of global warming and changes in rainfall patterns on their diversity and distributions is therefore paramount to their conservation.As turtles live such long lives, it is impossible to conduct experiments to test for the impact of warming over several generations. The group used a novel combination of state of the art climate models and the deep time fossil record of turtles during warmer times.

The results of this study show that during periods with much warmer climates, turtles and tortoises were able to stand the heat in the warmer tropics - as long as there was enough water to support those species living in rivers and lakes. Some groups of turtles have maintained similar niches over millions of years. They have withstood warmer climates in the past and their ability to adapt to the rate of environmental change happening today will be an important factor in their resilience to future climate change.

These findings were communicated with stakeholders at an engagement event at the NHM in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>35D9B739-776F-4B1A-AF77-32D30FB16A25</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5450151388fbb5.49696903</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) Elucidating the impact of future global climate change on the biogeographic distributions of reptilian ectotherms is of key importance due to their close physiological ties with the thermal environment and their current vulnerable conservation status. Despite this, no studies have yet exploited the deep-time fossil record to address this question, particularly within a rigorous and quantitative model framework. For the first time, we apply an ecological models to quantify the testudine (turtle) climatic niche, and test for niche stability between the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian, ~ 72 - 66.0 Ma) and modern. Our findings suggest significant niche stability for several testudine families and ecotypes over an extended evolutionary timescale. We find that long-established testudine families show greater climatic niche stability whereas those diversifying close to the Late Cretaceous display larger niche expansion towards the modern. This is the first study of its kind for any Mesozoic vertebrate group and provides an exciting benchmark for the extension of ecological modelling methods, most frequently applied in the modern or recent palaeo-record to date, to further deep-time palaeoclimate intervals. As such our findings are extremely timely and relevant for conservation policymakers.

2) The application of transfer functions on fossil assemblages to reconstruct past environments is fundamentally based on the assumption of stable environmental niches in both space and time. We quantitatively test this assumption for six dominant planktic foraminiferal species, main species to carry information about past climates in the ocean. We contrast reconstructions of species realized and optimum distributions in the modern and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using an ecological niche model. Niche stability was greatest for (sub)polar species, with greatest expansion of the niche observed for tropical species. The lower observed niche stability for (sub)tropical taxa T. sacculifer and G. ruber (pink) suggests that (sub)tropical temperatures could be underestimated in the glacial ocean with the strongest effect in the equatorial Atlantic where both species are found today.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>discussions with conservation groups, NGOs or general conservation policy decision makers
