Established by Poincare in a series of inspiringarticles in the late 1800's much of the work in low-dimensionaltopology was combinatorial in nature. In 1979 Thurston revolutionizedthe field by revealing deep connections to many other, more geometric,areas of mathematics.The geometric theme in low-dimensional topology has expanded to include coarse geometry. One striking success of this theme was the work of Masur and Minsky [1999, 2000]; they introduced the idea of using coarse geometry to understand the complex of curves. The complex of curves, defined by Harvey, is a combinatorial analogue of Teichmuller space.The novelty proposed here is to use the methods of Masur and Minsky tostudy and solve combinatorial problems, some first encountered byPoincare, in low-dimensional topology. The themes running through theproposal include handlebodies and Heegaard diagrams, the recognitionproblem for the three-sphere, the structure of the mapping classgroup, and the cobordism group of automorphisms of surfaces.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct impact of this project will be on the UK and international community of low-dimensional, geometric, and three-dimensional topologists. The project is also highly relevant to coarse geometers and researchers in the fields of Kleinian groups, Teichmuller theory and the mapping class group. To ensure this impact, all completed work resulting from the grant will be posted on the PI's website, uploaded to the arXiv, and published in journals. The PI will give conference and seminar talks on the completed work, both in the UK and internationally. Furthermore, all software written for the project will be open source and posted on the PI's website as well as to CompuTop.org.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88321</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is joint work with Henry Segerman.

A torus link is a link that can be drawn on a torus. A Seifert surface spans its link, somewhat like a soap-film clinging to its supporting wire-frame. The surface acts as a bridge between the 1-dimensional link and the 3-dimensional space it lives in.

The torus links and their Seifert surfaces live most naturally in the 3-sphere, a higher dimensional version of the more familiar sphere. We transfer our sculptures to Euclidean 3-space using stereographic projection. The Seifert surface is cut out of the 3-sphere by the Milnor fibers of the corresponding algebraic singularity. We parametrize the Milnor fiber, following the work of Tsanov, via fractional automorphic forms. These give a map from SL(2,R), the canonical geometry of the torus link complement, to the 3-sphere.

The patterns on the Seifert surface arise from two applications of the Schwarz-Christoffel theory of complex analysis, turning a Euclidean triangle into a hyperbolic one. The pattern used is our maker's mark - a stylized Whitehead link.</gtr:description><gtr:id>50F2ABFD-FC83-4D33-A5E7-5D07FD6FE99D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The (3,3) Seifert surface and its various relatives appeared in our solo show at the Simons Center.

The mathematical work funded by this grant has found artistic expression via joint work of Henry Segerman and myself. For example, three of our 3D sculptures were displayed at the juried art exhibition of the 2012 Bridges conference. Our piece Dual half 120- and 600-Cells won &amp;quot;Best use of mathematics&amp;quot;, one of the four prizes awarded; it was subsequently pictured in Scientific American. Since that time we have participated in numerous art exhibition (solo and joint), permanently installed pieces in three universities, given numerous public talks, designed centerpieces for a gala at the Museum of Mathematics, and so on. Some of our work is freely available at the file-sharing websites Thingiverse, and can be printed by anybody with a 3D printer.

As promised in the impact plan for the grant all of the software (written by myself and my postgraduate student at the time, Mark Bell) has been posted online and is freely available for download, use, study, modification, and sharing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D4492AB7-54D2-4264-A2A6-4135A77162E9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e16917252b19.16146021</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research carried out under this grant lies between topology and geometry. All of my work, in one way or another, comes down to the &amp;quot;problem of moduli&amp;quot;. That is, suppose we have a surface B: say, an inflated balloon. By pressing our fingers into the balloon we can distort the &amp;quot;geometry&amp;quot; of the surface, while leaving the &amp;quot;topology&amp;quot; unchanged. The problem of moduli asks what geometries are possible for a given topology. Moreover, it asks how these different geometries are related to each other. 

Here is how to attack the problem: we collect all of the possible geometries (eg all distorted balloons) into a &amp;quot;moduli space&amp;quot; Mod(B) and ask questions about this new object. As one quite simple question, we could ask &amp;quot;what are the most efficient paths in moduli space?&amp;quot;. In our toy example, we have two distorted balloons B and B'. The question asks for the quickest way to move, through the space of all such, from B to B'. 

So, when studying the geometry and topology of a space B, we naturally begin to study the geometry and topology of Mod(B). All of my work focuses on moduli spaces of low-dimensional objects, such as curves, surfaces, and three-dimensional manifolds. For example, Leininger and I showed that the the &amp;quot;thick part&amp;quot; of moduli space of marked surfaces contains hyperbolic planes. Futer and I studied the moduli of tori that appear as the boundaries of hyperbolic three-manifolds, and so on.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Please see the section on Narrative Impact for an artistic (and, to a lesser extent, economic) application of some of my work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ED7059B8-89FE-47A2-A22B-A3AB1D3F91EE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e16fc8ef53d0.88530307</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Schleimer_S/0/1/0/all/0/1</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Twister is a program by Mark Bell, Tracy Hall and myself for constructing triangulations of surface bundles and Heegaard splittings from a description of a mapping class of a surface.
