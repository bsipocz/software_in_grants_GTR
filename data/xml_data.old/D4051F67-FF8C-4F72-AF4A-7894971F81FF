&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>how is the rapid expansion of mobile phone usage impacting on young lives and how can policy makers support the positive aspects of change (and constrain negative elements)?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project builds directly on previous research on children?s mobility in which baseline quantitative data and preliminary qualitative information was collected on mobile phone usage. In this study a wider range of issues will be covered, eg:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>changes in gendered (and age) patterns of phone use over time; phone use in building social networks to support job search etc&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>impacts on education, employment, livelihoods and health status&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>safety and surveillance&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>possible connections to migration&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>youth identity, image &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>exploitation/empowerment questions. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;Mixed-method, participatory child-centred studies will be conducted in the same 24 sites across Ghana, Malawi and South Africa (urban, peri-urban, rural, remote rural in two agro-ecological zones per country).&amp;nbsp; It will build on the baseline data for 9-18 year-olds through repeat and extended studies, plus additional studies with 19-25 year-olds&amp;nbsp; (to capture changing usage and its impacts as our initial cohort move into their 20s). The country research teams will include available ?child? researchers from our previous study. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We aim to achieve impact both among Direct and Indirect Beneficiaries. 

Direct beneficiaries include: 
a) Young people (male and female) in our 24 study communities, who suffer many disadvantages in their lives and for whom mobile phones offer new opportunities and life chances, but also new dangers. (Their parents/carers and dependents will also benefit.) Girls and women would benefit particularly from better understanding of both potential advantages and dangers of improved phone access for expanding their (virtual) mobility; those in the remotest locations and from the poorest socio-economic groups may benefit most, given common constraints on their access to income and livelihoods, since the mobile phone offers enormous potential to leapfrog physical mobility constraints; 
b) Mobile phone network companies which need to maintain a positive public profile, by alerting them to potential hazards so that they can work to introduce safeguards; 
c) government departments and 
d) NGOs/CBOs which are directed at safeguarding young people and promoting their well-being. With each of these groups we will disseminate and discuss our findings about opportunities, dangers and relevant potential safeguarding measures. 
e) Young researchers (especially those currently unemployed) from the Child Mobility study who, through work in this project, will obtain direct financial benefit plus additional work experience valuable for their career development. They will consolidate the research techniques they learned in the CM study and benefit through further engagement with Country Consultative Group (CCG) members (youth, health and other ministries, NGOs, phone network companies etc.) (The CCG meetings are crucial for sensitisation of key actors, promoting commitment, ownership and dissemination of research outputs, so that country-wide policy and practice impacts are generated.) 

Potential Indirect Beneficiaries include young people, their dependents and carers across the 3 study countries (i.e. constituting well over half the total population per country) and other potential users. 

Target audiences include in-country Ministries of Women and Children's Affairs, Communications, Employment, Health, Education, Transport; local youth-focused NGOs/CBOs, and those working in livelihoods, communications, education, health etc; in-country and international private sector mobile phone network providers; international NGOs focused on young people; relevant bilateral and multilateral agencies (e.g. DFID, SDC, World Bank, UNICEF); African Technology Policy Studies Network; National Forum Groups of the International Forum for Rural Development and Transport (IFRTD). 

Our project evidence base and policy guidelines will have wide value in our focus countries, across Africa and beyond, promoting sensitisation to young people's needs among both our identified beneficiaries (particularly youth, their parents/carers and dependents) and target audiences (policy makers, practitioners and the private sector), and to the positives and negatives offered by mobiles phones. It should help maximise the benefits of rapid mobile phone adoption among young people and minimise the disbenefits, with consequent improvements in the well-being of young people, their dependants and carers in Africa (and elsewhere). Particular attention will be given to dissemination to local and international intermediary organisations that will deliver findings on to end-users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>465367</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge food security forum meeting on new technologies and food security</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CC2D677D-18AD-4FC8-BB3B-862B67A3EB64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to present and discuss the role of new technologies in food security alongside Oxfam and Vodafone - part of a University organised series of debates [I spoke on transport and phone connectivity in Africa].</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b0bf90c0ac34.11607126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Ghana Education Service Management committee on pupil and teacher phone use issues</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D98E48AE-1C79-4E65-B9D5-70724D0A1BAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with GES management committee one week prior to and in preparation for ESRC funded Workshop on responsible phone use in Ghana [including presentation of main project findings].</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58383a1e668af8.52471878</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>participation in Impact Initiative - Child Poverty Research Day, IDS Sussex</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4F47455-618D-49A5-BDC0-9333CBD6A84B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact Initiative - Child Poverty Research Day - paper given on phones study livelihoods issues [DU, G.Porter]

Further details re impacts in education, transport/mobility/security and associated with our co-investigation methodology are provided below: 

Education sector: 
ESRC Global Challenge Research Funds [15k] have supported further work with the education sector in Ghana and Malawi. We have used our project findings to produce draft advice sheets for head-teachers in both countries on promoting responsible phone use among pupils and teachers and are now working with the national education authorities in each country and head-teachers to review the agreed advice and then promote its adoption nationally [workshops completed in Ghana with Ghana Education Service and teachers; and in Malawi with MoEST and teachers]. Publication of our findings in the UCT Children's Institute annual Child Gauge publication for southern Africa 2015 and a request for a piece on phones and educational issues in Africa from the Conversation has subsequently led to various requests for media interviews, including a Channel Islam International radio interview from Johannesburg and email communication (Oct 2016) from the e-learning unit in South Africa's Department of Basic Education regarding an intention to refer to our findings in their policy recommendations. All of this will help bring attention to the need to actively promote more responsible phone use. South Africa's National Association of Child and Youth Care Workers (NACCW) also asked for - and were granted- permission to reproduce the education brief (prepared for South Africa last year) in their quarterly journal which goes out to CYCW staff around the country. This takes the key messages to those professionals working with youth at community-level and those responsible for their education and training - so a potential powerful network in terms of helping youth navigate the risks and reap the benefits of mobile phone technology. An article outlining our work in the education sector has also been published by the African Technology Policy Studies Network (ATPS) newsletter, Technopolicy Africa Issue 004 [http://www.atpsnet.org/Files/ATPS_Newsletter-_Technopolicy_Africa_Issue_0004.pdf. ]

Transport/mobility/security:
Advisory work on gender mainstreaming in the transport sector [by the PI] has continued with the African Development Bank, supporting promotion of improved understanding of current and potential linkages between physical and virtual mobility and the implications for girls' and women's safety in transport contexts [based on our project findings]. We have also been contacted by disability and other NGOs interested in our work, following on from the IfRTD newsletter reporting our findings (December 2015). A small advisory input on transport and ICT linkages has been made into a Cities Alliance project, funded by the UNDP, on the informal urban economy in Uganda; other [PI] advisory work supporting NGO studies on transport, including ICT linkages, in Kenya [for IFRTD], in Tanzania [for HelpAge] and Nepal [under the DFID-funded ReCAP programme] has also commenced.

Co-investigation methodology: 
Our co-investigation methodology continues to attract interest and resulted in the PI being invited to Germany's Transport Research Institute, and to present in a Devex Webinar on Research into Practice, sponsored by the DFID-funded ReCAP programme. A further new collaboration between the PI and HelpAge International in Tanzania building on this approach has also now commenced.

This includes a quantitative survey of phone use [N=4,500: 9-18y= 3000; 19-25y=1,500] and intensive qualitative research with young people aged c. 9-25y, their carers and other key informants [N= c.1,600 transcripts]. The mixed method approach, supported by our in-depth experience in these 24 sites since 2006, enables extensive triangulation. Input from young peer researchers [trained initially 2006] has been extremely valuable. 

Key developments in young people's phone ownership/usage: comparing 2007/8 and 2013/14 data: Ownership of mobile phones (all types) increased massively in all three countries (from 0.6% to 8% in Malawi, 2% to 16% in Ghana, 21% to 51% in South Africa). Usage levels have also expanded substantially: regarding the week prior to survey, usage had expanded from 9% to 35% in Malawi, 17% to 42% in Ghana, 56% to 77% in South Africa. Levels of ownership and use thus still vary substantially, with South Africa in the lead, followed by Ghana, then Malawi (reflecting overall wealth differences between the three countries, as in 2007/8). Both ownership and use, unsurprisingly, continue to be more heavily concentrated in urban areas (with better network reception). Gendered patterns of ownership evident among 9-18 year olds in Ghana and Malawi in 2007/8 still prevail, but in South Africa our survey data suggest there is parity now. Basic phones, ubiquitous in 2007/8, still dominate, but by 2013/14 around 40% of 9-25 year olds in South Africa said they were accessing the internet through smart phones and around 1/10th in Ghana and Malawi. Unsurprisingly, smart phone usage gradations are evident by settlement type, with lowest access in remote rural locations, highest in urban areas. 

Key findings [2012-15] relate to education, health, mobility and livelihoods.
Education: positive educational value among pupils mostly revolves around its use for mundane purposes (e.g. clarifying homework tasks). Negative impacts were widely recorded: academic performance affected by disrupted classes (pupil and teacher usage); disruptions in sleep patterns associated with cheap night calls; time lost through prolonged sessions on social network sites; harassment and bullying; widespread access to pornography. 
Health: Mobile phones are widely used to facilitate access to healthcare. Young people used mobile phones principally to call people in their personal networks for assistance and/or advice in the event of illness (less often, for assistance/advice from health professionals, the internet, radio/TV shows, SMS 'health tips'). Ability to make effective use of the healthcare-facilitating possibilities of mobile phones was circumscribed by the extent and quality of personal networks, Meanwhile, healthcare workers use their phones informally to support poor communities, but at substantial personal cost. 
Inter-generational relations: Many young people are already 'experts' in phone use and recognised as such by older family members (often passive, episodic users). The role they are often expected to take on as 'infomediaries' is giving them a new source of power within the family as information hubs. Their phone competency also increasingly contains/limits surveillance efforts and associated supervision. 
Gender relations: Networks of romance are now increasingly managed/consolidated through the use of mobile phones. A strongly gendered phone etiquette prevails; gifting patterns and obligations are often highly gendered from a young age. The phone has become strongly implicated in juggling of multiple relationships. Speculative calls to unknown females, including through random number calling, is common among boys and men. Friend requests on social network sites are widely accepted, even those coming from total strangers. 
Mobility/transport: Mobile phones are now used widely for key transport-related activities: organising everyday travel, coordinating/synchronising towards better space/time management; organising transport in emergencies [especially health emergencies]; substituting for physical mobility [especially where incomes are low, road conditions poor, transport costly, irregular/ unavailable, traffic accident rates high, threats of robbery/harassment/violence high, females face family-imposed travel constraints]. The potential to leapfrog physical mobility has uncertain implications for gender relations; much depends on specific context. 
Livelihoods: Mobile phones facilitate job search and livelihood opportunities for some young people of both genders, in all sites, but especially urban areas. Youth draw on their social networks utilising a complex mix of social and economic strands. Direct employment in phone-related enterprise is generally combined with other petty trades or small enterprises. Phone usage to build livelihoods and configure new ones is less prominent than we anticipated, though it is used very extensively to garner resources. For youth who are unemployed or in formal education, the phone has become an essential tool in securing financial and other material resources to support everyday living expenses, especially from older family members. Mobile money is increasingly used to organise transfer of funds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the academic community we envisage follow up of our findings particularly in the education, health, livelihoods and transport/mobility sectors: within our research group, Alister Munthali and Augustine Tanle will take this forward in the education sector, Kate Hampshire and the UCC team in the health sector (in connection with a Wellcome grant), Ariane de Lannoy, and the UCT group + Gina Porter in livelihoods, Gina Porter and all three country teams in the transport/moblities/migration sector. Additionally, we anticipate interest from other academic researchers in these areas and potential collaborations between our team and external groups (for instance on urban/smart transport with the Institute of Transport Studies, Leeds University and on phones in migration with UCL and Middlesex). UCC and Durham are now participating in a new funded GCRF transport network on meeting the needs of vulnerable poplulations [led from ITS Leeds, K. Lucas] and will hold a meeting for the network in Cape Coast in May 17. 
 
In the non-academic sector, we have already provided detailed feedback to our study communities and continue to have interactions with members of our Country Consultative Groups [government, NGOs, private sector]. We are in discussion about promoting responsible phone use with ministries of education, UNICEF (e.g. the Malawi office has requested and received our Malawi survey data) and UNESCO based on our education/youth findings and received ESRC Impact Acceleration Account funding to run workshops with headteachers in Ghana (conducted Oct 2016) and Malawi (conducted Nov 2016) with some modest follow-up from Newton Funding in Malawi. The transport sector findings have been circulated through IFRTD, an AFCAP training programme and are currently being fed into an AfDB staff transport training programme and gender mainstreaming guidelines to encourage transport projects to take more account of the potential for mobile phone/transport connectivities. Our findings in diverse sectors (inter-generational relations, health, livelihoods, transport) are proving of considerable interest to HelpAge International and other NGOs [including disability-focused NGOs]. Through policy briefings on education and health prepared with UCT's Children's Institute (and our contribution to their Child Gauge publication) we expect to have continued engagement with government and the NGO sector (for instance, Love Life), particularly across southern Africa. We will also continue with our efforts to engage with private sector network providers.
