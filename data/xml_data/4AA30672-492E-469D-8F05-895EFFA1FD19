'new economy' continue to be widely debated. As firms reorganise work and seek to minimise labour 

costs in the recessionary context, 'flexibility' for many workers has come to mean increased workloads, 

less predictable schedules, and more unsocial work hours. Household life has also become more 

complex with more dual earner and lone-parent households, decline of the extended family, and 

greater eldercare responsibilities in the context of increased life expectancy. Simultaneously, the 

neoliberal attack on social provisioning has transferred the burden of care down to the 'natural' level 

of home where most women retain major responsibility for the everyday activities of social 

reproduction. The overall result is an ongoing, complex, gendered, multi-variable balancing act 

between the competing demands of paid work and responsibilities, commitments and life interests 

beyond the workplace, for which workers have only finite time and energy.

As the neoliberal attack on social provisioning has transferred the burden of care down to the 'natural' level of home where most women retain the major responsibility for the 'messy and fleshy' components of domestic and family life, significant gender variations in work-life stress persist. Studies have highlighted, therefore, the importance of employer provided 'work-life balance' (WLB) arrangements as a means for improving gender equity in market employment and household caring, and for combating the increasing work pressures that are destabilising many households and communities. Yet despite the profound moral and social significance of WLB, it is increasingly recognised that employers are unlikely to implement meaningful WLB arrangements unless they can identify 'bottom-line' economic advantages that arise from their implementation. However, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence to support the so-called 'WLB business case'. At the same time, conventional WLB business case analyses often sideline social equity concerns of workers and their families, and in their focus on revealed output measures of firm performance, say little about the underlying determinants of firms' competitive performance in the New Economy. 



In response, this paper presents new empirical evidence from two high tech regional economies (Dublin and Cambridge) to develop an alternative socioeconomic analysis focused on: (i) gendered experiences of work-life conflict in the IT industry; (ii) the arrangements that different groups of IT workers and their families find most useful in ameliorating those work-life conflicts; and (iii) the mechanisms through which workers' use of those preferred WLB arrangements helps foster and support routine learning and innovation processes within knowledge-intensive firms.

As part of this, the desirability and means of achieving an appropriate work-life 'balance' (WLB) has attracted a lot of attention. WLB provision is recognised as an important means for improving gender equity in market employment and household caring, and for combating the increasing work pressures that are destabilising households and societal integration. Problematically however, evidence of progress by employers in providing WLB arrangements is limited, resulting in continuing hardship for many workers and ongoing gender inequalities in the labour market. Scholars have argued that employers are unlikely to implement meaningful WLB arrangements unless they can identify 'bottom-line' economic advantages that arise from their implementation. However, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence to support the so-called 'WLB business case'. Additionally, 'few scholars have demonstrated the mechanisms through which such [WLB] policies function (or do not) to enhance firm performance' (Eaton 2003: 145-6). 

Based on a comparative study of IT firms in Dublin, Ireland and Cambridge, UK this research explores gendered conflicts between work, home and family amongst IT workers; the kinds of WLB arrangements that different worker cohorts find most useful in reconciling those conflicts; and the everyday mechanisms through which worker uptake of those preferred WLB arrangements can also enhance the kinds of routine worker learning and innovation processes widely recognised to underpin firms' competitive advantage. The research also examines the impact of different WLB provisions on knowledge spillovers between firms within regional economies, and their mediation by institutional structures at the regional and national scales. The research has involved 68 in-depth interviews with IT workers, managers, and labour organisers; two regional surveys of IT employers (150 firms in total with combined local employment of 8068 workers); and a WLB / labour mobility survey of 162 IT workers. 

The research findings highlight a series of common sources of work-life conflict amongst knowledge workers in the IT sector including: temporal variability of work hours over product development life-cycles; communication between international work team members in different time zones; evening and weekend trouble-shooting; and the continual need to maintain skillsets in a dynamic industry. In contrast to enlightened policy rhetoric, the results also suggest that everyday conflicts between the activities of work, home and family are felt most acutely by working mothers with dependent children, who continue to undertake the majority share of household labour and childcare. Women make up on average 23% of employees in the IT firms studied. The most commonly cited negative work-to-home spillovers include: missing out on children's activities, interrupted sleep patterns, stress and exhaustion impacting on relationships with children and partners, working when feeling unwell, missing out on leisure time and hobbies, and reduced quality of life. These, in turn, motivate many workers to seek flexible working arrangements to effect change for the better. 

While workers' preferred WLB arrangements vary within gender groups (by job function, department, household situation) and for individual workers over the life-course, the research has also identified worker dissatisfaction with the kinds of WLB arrangements most commonly available to them: flextime. While flextime affords some advantages by allowing workers to re-jig the temporal pattern of hours worked, it fails to address what for many workers are the underlying causes of work-life conflict: commonly, total work hours and lengthy commutes. The results indicate the advantages afforded to workers by greater spatial flexibility of work (e.g. teleworking) and/or by reduced total work hours (e.g. 3 or 4 day weeks) as: more time for extra-curricular activities, hobbies and interests; better quality of personal time; reduced levels of stress and exhaustion; and better quality of time spent with children. 

The research findings highlight three key mechanisms through which the provision of these worker-preferred WLB arrangements also enhance everyday learning processes within knowledge-intensive firms: (i) self-determination of temporal pattern and spatial location of work yielding a self-identified improvement in workers' concentration, motivation, engagement and creativity; (ii) the reduction of work-life conflicts and stress which otherwise undermine workers' abilities to interact and communicate effectively with colleagues; and (iii) the potential to attract and retain a more demographically diverse workforce thereby widening firms' repertoires of perspectives &amp;amp; skills; networks of external contacts; and hence capacities for comprehensive problem-solving in the face of new events. The results also indicate a series of challenges to learning that arise from non-traditional working arrangements, but that these are mediated by corporate culture (e.g. work group ratification / managerial buy-in of WLB take-up) and the use of ICTs to facilitate team interactions at a distance. Of the 150 IT companies surveyed, 61% identified increased worker productivity as a consequence of their WLB provision, and 54% an improved corporate environment for learning and creativity. These managerial perceptions of the benefits of WLB provision are consistent with measured improvements in firm performance over the same time period (2004-7). Only 5% of companies perceived a negative impact of WLB provision on worker productivity, and only 2.5% a negative impact on corporate environment for learning and creativity. 

The research also identifies the impacts of formal WLB provisions and informal WLB practices (especially managerial trust and support) in shaping decision-making around gendered patterns of job-to-job interfirm mobility, and their mediation by different national gendered welfare regimes. In short, many IT workers are responding to differential employer provision of WLB arrangements by voting with their feet: one third of workers surveyed identified 'poor WLB provision' in their previous company as a v/important reason for leaving that company (PUSH); and two thirds of workers surveyed identified 'better WLB provision' as a v/important reason for moving to their current company (PULL). Importantly, this research indicates that the kinds of worker mobility so widely celebrated in the regional learning and innovation literature - and in regional development policy - as positively underpinning regional economic competitiveness are in fact premised on: a gendered dissatisfaction with work-life conflict; unequal divisions of household labour; uneven &amp;amp; often inadequate employer WLB provision; and worker concerns that stretch far beyond 'the economic' around issues of care &amp;amp; improved quality of life. As such, the research contributes new insights to important inter-disciplinary and policy debates on the future of work and socially sustainable regional competitiveness in the New Economy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research expands the evidence base to support the WLB 'business case' articulated by policy-makers and HR professionals. Despite its popularity, there remains a relative dearth of empirical evidence to support the WLB 'business case', and previous studies are limited by three major conceptual / methodological problems identified in this research: (i) prioritisation of employer needs at the expense of workers and their families; (ii) limited focus on output measures of firm performance rather than the underlying sources of firms' long-term sustainable competitive advantage; and (iii) atomisation of firms from the regional industrial systems of which they form part. These three limits frame the alternative regional learning / WLB mutual gains analysis developed in this research concerned to: identify the kinds of WLB arrangements that workers and their families find most useful in reducing work-life conflicts; to identify the intra- and cross-firm mechanisms through which different bundles of employer-provided WLB arrangements can also enhance firms' learning and innovative capacities; and to explore how those WLB-learning outcomes vary geographically within and between regional economies. These research findings are especially salient in the context of the economic crisis and strategies recovery. The research suggests that far from being just a short-term cost to employers that might be sacrificed in pursuit of post-recessionary cost savings, WLB provision represents a crucial (yet under-researched) component of firms' long-term capacities for innovation, learning and socioeconomic competitiveness.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>531BF1BD-DEBF-483C-B7CC-50512C90B0FF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5622623474.917024775ff16a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-000-22-1574-A/read</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>538DCF5E-1DE4-432B-AAF1-B56B4E9A1B11</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gendered Geographies of High-Tech Regional Economies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geography Compass</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e24435d10b7879eb5b4e52b60b9f6028"><gtr:id>e24435d10b7879eb5b4e52b60b9f6028</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>James A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfbbfbb65963f0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D62BC2B5-2A45-423E-99B7-11158191BDEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Work-life 'balance' and gendered (im)mobilities of knowledge and learning in high-tech regional economies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Economic Geography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e24435d10b7879eb5b4e52b60b9f6028"><gtr:id>e24435d10b7879eb5b4e52b60b9f6028</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>James A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545240cd080d36.84934094</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B5930188-BAAE-47DF-A8C7-3BFC03E958B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Work-Life &amp;acirc;??Balance&amp;acirc;??, Recession and the Gendered Limits to Learning and Innovation (Or, Why It Pays Employers To Care)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gender, Work &amp;
