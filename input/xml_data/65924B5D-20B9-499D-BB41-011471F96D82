The key idea is investigate the spinning disc atomisation process, which is the cheapest and most efficient atomisation method applicable to numerous materials, both theoretically and using theory-guided experiments, and incorporte the findings into a technological platform using the help and resources of an industrial company experiences in this kind of upscaling. Besides its main deliverable, the research will also develop a methodology of investigating a multi-faceted industrial problem where the multiplicity of potential outcomes of the technological process is controlled only implicitly by a few operational parameters.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The wide use of the spinning disc atomisation (SDA) process is due to the fact that it is the
simplest, cheapest and most efficient atomisation technique. The proposed research is the first of
its kind, as it is aimed at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the process, including (a) the
modelling of SDA as a whole, with different elements of it interacting and influencing each other, as
it ultimately leads to the 'end product', i.e. droplets with a certain distribution of sizes, (b) verifying
the findings experimentally via targeted theory-guided experiments, (c) integrating the results into a
technology platform via Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. This 'holistic' approach ensures that the
obtained knowledge becomes an operational tool that will allow the industries to control and
optimize their use of the SDA in various technological conditions as well as design new
technological processes. The map of regimes to be computed and experimentally verified in the
course of this project will serve as a guide allowing one to make reliable predictions and informed
decisions in designing SDA systems and optimising their governing parameters. Thus, firstly, there
will be an immediate impact of the proposed research as its results will be turned into an
operational tool and become directly transferable to the industrial users. Both of these aspects will
be ensured via Tata Consultancy Services Ltd which is an industrial partner closely involved in this
project.
Secondly, the proposed research will develop a methodology of investigating industrial processes
characterized by an implicit connection between the few operational paramters and a rich variety of
the potential outcomes. This situation is common to a number of emerging technologies and a
methodology how to deal with the problem with a minimum of expensive and time-consuming
experiments will be of great value to, and have an immediate impact on, a number of industries.
Thirdly, extensions of the SDA technology to include additional physical and chemical factors, from
thermal to electromagnetic, to manipulate and control the process will all need the reliable
description of fluid mechanics of the SDA as the background flow, i.e. the first approximation to
build on. The methodology of the proposed research provides a framework to incorporate these
effects. In this sense, the proposed work is 'open-ended', as it allows one to set up consortia and
innovation companies to develop new technological processes.
Fourthly, the proposed work will forge a new collaborative link between the UK and India as well as
of both UK-based and India-based teams with industry. This framework will allow the teams to
initiate new long-term research programmes aimed at addressing the needs of specific
technologies.
Documentation
The main deliverables of the project will be accumulated in the computer-based form, which,
together with detailed descriptions of the products, will ensure efficient knowledge transfer to
potential users. The results will also be documented by the industrial partner who will ensure
compatibility of the platform to be developed with the existing tools. The results, as well as
additional information accumulated in the course of this study, will be continuously documented
internally to ensure continuity of the work beyond the duration of the proposed project.
Dissemination and Exploitation
On the industry side, the results will be disseminated via Tata Consultancy Services that has many
links with the users of the SDA process world wide. On the academic side, the findings of this
project will be disseminated widely by presentations at conferences, symposia and workshops, such
as DFD APS, ILASS, EUROMECH and ISCST, as well as by publication of papers in the
appropriate scientific and engineering journals, such as J. Fluid Mech., Phys. Fluids, Atomization
and Sprays, Chem. Eng. Sci., Int. J.

The developed computational platform is now capable to operate in a range of industrially-relevant regimes. Given that the spinning disc atomisation technology is an integral part of many industries, the University of Birmingham is beginning to engage potential industrial users of the developed platform. Morgan Advanced Materials as one of potential users indicated its interest in becoming a beneficiary of the obtained results.

The development of the platform has created many know-hows, including the methodology of dealing with 3-dimensional unsteady free-boundary flow in the complex geometry of the transition zone and the way of incorporating mathematical models of different type operating in different regions of the flow domain. This methodology and the experience gained in its implementation constitute the most far-reaching aspect of the research that has been carried out. It has been disseminated via a number of research forums, from the general-purpose colloquia and conferences (BAMC 20165, EFMC 2016) to the specialized meetings involving, in particular, industrial practitioners (ILASS 2016, EMN Meeting on Droplets 2016).

A particular far-reaching outcome of the investigation is that it has been discovered that the entire research output produced in the area of curved liquid jets worldwide has been fundamentally erroneous in a very demonstrable way and hence could only massively mislead its potential users, notably in such industries as micro-atomisation, glass fibre manufacturing and nano-thread generation. As one of the outcomes of the project is a detailed study showing where and how the mistakes occurred and what the correct procedure and results are. This study, which now paved the way for different applications involving curved liquid jets, has been reported at the 11th European Fluid Mechanics Conferenced (Seville, Spain, 2016) and generated considerable interest among practitioners. A paper laying out a verifiable mathematical framework for this class of fluid flows and an analysis of the errors published in the literature has been accepted by the top journal in the field (Journal of Fluid Mechanics).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EFF3CC6C-5E9F-40E9-98B9-0B704F867E65</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5efc82edc92.96740766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The mathematical model and the corresponding numerical platform now cover the spinning disc atomisation process in its entirety, from the wavy film flow on the spinning disc up to the formation of drops from the ligaments in which the fluid leaves the disc. 
The key findings obtained so far are as follows:
1. The most important finding is that there exists a synchronisation between the waves in the film and the waves that go down the ligaments and eventually break them into drops. The corresponding phase diagram relating the amplitudes of the two waves effectively plays the role of a 'signature' characterising a particular regime of atomisation. This fact gives one a 'shortcut' to the practical usage of the theoretical knowledge potentially allowing, in some cases, to by-pass the intricate consideration of the complex 3-dimensional unsteady free-boundary flow in the transition zone.
2. It was discovered also that the ligaments leaving the disc rotate at an angular velocity different from that of the disc: they lag behind with the relative difference depending on the flow rate and the angular velocity itself. This fact, which has never been reported previously, can have considerable implications for the design of the spinning disc atomisation process, in particular for geometry of the disc edge.
3. It was shown that all results on curved (in particular, spiralling) liquid jets reported in the world literature in the past 20 years have been profoundly erroneous, and the correct procedures and results have been formulated.
4. In developing a new computational algorithm, a method of matching models with different dimensionalities operating in different regions of the flow domain has been formulated and tested numerically.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The developed computational platform can now be used and, with the industrial involvement, generate tangible economic impact.
