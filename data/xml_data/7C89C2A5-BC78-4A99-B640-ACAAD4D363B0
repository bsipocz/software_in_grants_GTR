These eight films - including creative documentaries, an artist's feature film and specially recorded in-conversations with leading intellectuals - address marginal and untold histories of performance in inventive ways, and raise issues around the place of performance in new directions of contemporary thought.

The project will result in the professional post-production and distribution of these highly original and diverse works, making them available in screening formats and as purchasable DVDs. Alongside this, screenings to targeted media-industry professionals will be organised and contextualizing launch activities with major cultural sector partners will be mounted for diverse audiences. 

The commercial dissemination, screening and contextualizing events will combine one-way and interactive engagements that will facilitate knowledge exchange. Contextualising events will significantly broaden the audience and critical reception of the research concerns of Performance Matters beyond its existing substantive academic and artistic audiences, especially to popular art, media and film festival audiences.

Through carefully considered interactive engagement, and follow-up events, Crossovers will also develop new and sustainable relationships between media-industry and other public-sector professionals and the individuals and institutions associated with the project. Building on the way that Performance Matters developed the research engagement of public sector partner the Live Art Development Agency, Crossovers will not only foster development of the Agency's publishing arm, but will also lead to sustained forms of knowledge exchange between performance scholars/organisers and film festival directors, video distributors and commissioning TV editors.

In this way, Crossovers is designed to build sustainable professional relationships around performance studies media-products that will have lasting effects beyond the period of the award.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries of this project fall into three distinct categories: the cultural sector partner and its organisational collaborators; specific invited media professionals and other cultural sector workers; and numerous audience members for the film works (and contextualising events) with interests in contemporary art, film, performance, club, sub-cultures and popular thought.

The impacts achieved in the last three years of Performance Matters (evidenced in an Impact Case Study for both institutions in the coming REF) focused on the generation of new ways of thinking, the forging of new forms of creative expression, and the impact on participating cultural organisations in terms of their cultural practice and expansion of their user constituencies. Considerable change has been initiated for the main cultural sector partner and charity LADA (as evidenced in their supporting letter). The major programme of research work over the last three years has substantially developed LADA's educational, training and creative research profile, has generated new aspects of its archival and commercial publishing activities and expanded its user community in terms of its reach and diversity. This Follow-on Funding project will help to move the agency's work into active collaborations with committed new media and visual arts organisations; will help transform the nature of its publishing activities towards accessible moving image production and distribution; will create greater interaction with journalists and broadcast media, and through these means will considerably extend its user community in terms of scale and genres of interest. This will be achieved within the one-year period of the award. Further impact is envisaged beyond this point, however, as LADA will continue to build on the media relations and publications programme initiated by follow-on funding, adding new titles and expanding its users still further in subsequent years.

Specific influential media professionals and other cultural sector workers are targeted by the screening and knowledge exchange strategy in this project, which will create further pathways to impact in a range of film festivals and programmes, galleries, critical reviews and other cultural events. Crossovers will enhance and shape an interest in performance and its discourses in the public sphere, both through debate at the screening events, and in negotiating, where possible, further dissemination of Crossover titles through broadcast, exhibition and sale. We will gather evidence of impact both from professional attendees at our screening events (through audience surveys), and through keeping a log of all reviews and programmes that take on Crossovers films. 

The audience for these accessible DVD works (and their contextualising events) spans diverse constituencies of interest across the arts and popular thought, and will shift these constituencies' understandings of the status, cultural and critical potentials of performance. Wide, popular, interdisciplinary dissemination of this kind strengthens audience attendance across the sector and deepens and enhances the quality of engagement with performance-related cultures and thinking.
 
As an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation LADA has considerable expertise in monitoring audience numbers and engagement through quantitative and qualitative means. Quantitative indicators the partners will use will include DVD sales, audience attendance figures, audience surveys demographics alongside self-nominated mailing list database figures. Qualitative indicators will include audience and participant surveys and testimonies from key contributing artists and organisations. The partners will monitor and report back on the initial impact through these means, feeding this analysis into their monthly managerial evaluations. As impact is ongoing it will be consistently monitored by LADA in these ways beyond the term of the award.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95356</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A feature-length documentary, directed by Gavin Butt and Ben Walters, edited by Tom Frederic with music by Morgan Quaintance.

Through the moving, funny, provocative and inspirational stories of 12 unique figures, This Is Not a Dream charts a path across four decades of avant-garde experiment and radical escapism. It traces the influences of Andy Warhol, John Waters and Jack Smith to the perverted frontiers of YouTube and Chatroulette, taking in subverted talk shows and soap operas, streetwalker fashions and glittery magic penises along the way.

The film is based on exclusive interviews shot in London, New York and Berlin with Dickie Beau, Dara Birnbaum, Nao Bustamante, Vaginal Davis, Cole Escola, Vincent Fremont, Alp Haydar, Holestar, David Hoyle, Kalup Linzy, Glenn O'Brien, and Scottee.

The video revolution of the 1970s offered unprecedented access to the moving image for artists and performers. New worlds began to unfold: you could talk back to the mainstream by hijacking its images and upending its values; you could reach out, through the camera, to fellow freaks; and you could create dreamscapes to explore other ways of being. This Is Not a Dream charts the lineage of this revolution and its continued impact on contemporary art and performance.</gtr:description><gtr:id>807FD1C5-30F8-44FE-8BCF-A50C1F3E4F86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A series of public screenings sometimes accompanied by performances and discussions.

An invitation for self-organised gatherings to host and experience the work - anywhere from a sitting room and work place to public spaces and venues - it also appeared at venues across London including Millbank Media Centre at Millbank Tower and OrganicLea, a workers cooperative on the edge of the Lea Valley.

Party for Freedom was loosely based on Vladimir Mayakovsky's 1921 play Mystery-Bouffe, telling the story of the Clean and the Unclean. It explored performances of liberation and political nakedness; and responded to the changing landscape of Dutch politics following the assassinations of controversial Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn in 2001 and film director Theo van Gogh in 2004, and the ensuing popularity of Geert Wilders, the Dutch politician and leader of the far-right Partij voor de Vrijheid [Party for Freedom].

Including newly commissioned punk, experimental and contemporary classical music by Finnish composer Timo-Juhani Kyll&amp;ouml;nen, all-girl post-punk band Woolf, and London-based musician Morgan Quaintance, the Party for Freedom moving-image work featured an irreverent array of characters and scenarios, developed through workshops and filmed in the lush setting of a 13th-century church in the English countryside. Questioning the currencies of perceived Western freedom, the work drew on trash aesthetics, leftist sentiments grounded in the 1960s and 1970s avant-garde, the hippy movement and far-right populist claims positing Islam and immigration as a threat.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BE8A0ACE-779B-469D-86F8-63CDEF382615</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An exhibition of Party for Freedom was shown at Overgaden, Copenhagen, from 7 September - 27 October 2013 and at Photographic Gallery Hippolyte, Helsinki, from 4-27 October 2013.

In this relaxed but intensive exchange Massumi discusses issues that have recurred across his writing: the nature of events, their sensuous and affective forces, immaterial art practices and their critical potential under capitalism, belief and hope and their relation to political agency. Taking in the scene as it goes by, the film constantly counterpoints these ideas with a micro-attention to the environment and the minor events the two figures are moving through. Charged ideas are quietly elaborated against a vibrant, restless backdrop of everyday life.

Brian Massumi is the author of major works in contemporary philosophy including Parables for the Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation and Semblance and Event: Activist Philosophy and the Occurrent Arts. He is also the translator of significant works of French philosophy including Gilles Deleuze and F&amp;eacute;lix Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus, Jean-Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Lyotard's The Postmodern Condition, and Jacques Attali's Noise.

Low-end showbiz memoirs, sensationalist biographical documentaries and cheap-to-make TV clip programmes compiling lists of 'The 100 Top/Best/Greatest...' are referenced alongside the faulty mechanics of museological, archival and curatorial approaches to assimilating live art. The result is a comedic performative critique of performance art historiographies.

Mel Brimfield is an artist working in film and performance. Between 2006-2008, she was Associate Producer at the Collective Gallery, Edinburgh, and also founded Brown Mountain College of the Performing Arts with Sally O'Reilly and Ben Roberts.

Drawn to conversation by reading Lingis' numerous books, Heathfield pays a visit to the philosopher's house near Baltimore where he discovers revealing dimensions of his ways of being and thinking.

The film assembles a rich patchwork of fragments taken from their dialogue over a period of two days. Lingis makes dynamic forays into thoughts that have preoccupied him in over forty years as a writer and traveller, drawing on his influences in phenomenology and ethics, and his extensive encounters with many places and cultures. The discussion moves from questions of the face and the gaze of others, the sensual experiences of weight and being touched, through considerations of performance, sculpture and dance, to meditations on mortality and suffering.

Alphonso Lingis is one of the most original voices in Contemporary American philosophy. He is the author of fourteen major works over the last forty years, including The Community of Those Who Have Nothing in Common, The Imperative, Dangerous Emotions, Trust, and Violence and Splendor. He is also the preeminent English translator of the works of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Emmanuel Levinas. He is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Penn State University.

As the dialogue with Adrian Heathfield evolves, writing emerges as a site and instrument for encounters with other voices and otherness, mortality and mystery, the infinite and the 'not yet thought'.

Recorded in Cixous' home in Paris, the conversation is punctuated by various interruptions and affinities (animal and familial) that are taken into the movement of her thought. Cixous' discourse flies between subjects as diverse as the song of the poetic, the temporality of invention, the re-thinking of the tragic, and the word becoming flesh and air in theatre.

H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Cixous is an eminent French thinker, writer, educator and theatre maker. Her experiments in writing, including the development of 'l'&amp;eacute;criture feminine' for which she is renowned, have had a wide-ranging influence on the fields of feminism, cultural theory, philosophy, literary criticism and theatre practice. She is Professor Emerita of Literature and Women's Studies at the Universit&amp;eacute; Paris 8 and Andrew D. White Professor at Large at Cornell University, New York.

A Conversation with Bernard Stiegler

In this dynamic exchange shot at the philosopher's residence in the heart of the French countryside, Stiegler re-evaluates his work on the logics and consequences of capitalism; its affects on individual and social well-being and transformative potential. Turning to questions of the status of art in relation to other forms of labour, Stiegler outlines a new vision of cultural industries based on economies of contribution and on technologies oriented towards care. In the face of a 'war on sensibility' Stiegler makes an impassioned call for the revivification of spirit.

Bernard Stiegler is the author of numerous works of philosophy including his three volume series Technics and Time (Stanford), For a New Critique of Political Economy (2010), Uncontrollable Societies and Disaffected Individuals (2013) and What Makes Life Worth Living (2013). He was the Director of the Department of Cultural Development at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris and is one of the founders of the political group Ars Industrialis.

In 2015 there were screenings at Stockholm University of the Arts and at Barn Cinema, Dartington (part of the Associated for Medical Humanities annual conference). On each occasion the events included extensive questions and discussion. There was an additional screening in 2016 by Camden Philosophical Society at Camden Public Library, Maine, USA.

The Whitechapel Gallery event was attended by 34 people and the Rich Mix event by 97 people from diverse backgrounds, locations and professional contexts.
Transfigured Night was subsequently translated and subtitled in Spanish and screened by Mapa Teatro at the Experimenta Sur festival Bogota, Columbia 4/6/14. The event was attended by 80 people drawn from artistic communities all over South America as part of the Experimenta Sur initiative.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8298916973.4520060cb92afe</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.richmix.org.uk/whats-on/event/dialogues-art-performance-film/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DVD Launch: Mel Brimfield - This is Performance Art: Parts One and Two</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4289501-AF15-4722-982A-40475E5B1D95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first screening of Mel Brimfield's fictional television documentary series, marking the fragmentary and unreliable nature of performance art's historical record.

Screening and Symposium
Rich Mix, Screen 2
Thursday 30 January 2014

This day-long symposium and screening event included the showing of two films from art writer Adrian Heathfield and photographer Hugo Glendinning's Performance Dialogues series: Transfigured Night and Technologies of Spirit. Speakers were drawn from film-making practice, fiction, photography, theatre and visual arts theory: Deborah Levy, Alan Read, Irit Rogoff, Mike Dibb, Gareth Evans, Hugo Glendinning and Adrian Heathfield. The event involved extensive public conversations.

The event was attended by 97 people from diverse backgrounds, locations and professional contexts.
Contemporary Theatre Review subsequently published a piece on the event including an edited sound recording of part of the conversation:

An invitation for self-organised gatherings to host and experience the work - anywhere from a sitting room and work place to public spaces and venues - received extensive response. The film-event also appeared at venues across London including Millbank Media Centre at Millbank Tower and OrganicLea, a workers cooperative on the edge of the Lea Valley. An exhibition of Party for Freedom was shown at Overgaden, Copenhagen, from 7 September - 27 October 2013 and at Photographic Gallery Hippolyte, Helsinki, from 4-27 October 2013. Screenings at Hippolyte were accompanied by live music from an eight-piece ensemble on 3, 4 and 5 October. Many events included extensive audience discussion.

The non-academic beneficiaries of this project fell into three distinct categories: the cultural sector partner and its organisational collaborators; specific invited media professionals and other cultural sector workers; and numerous audience members for the film works (and contextualising events) with interests in contemporary art, film, performance, club, sub-cultures and popular thought.

For the Live Art Development Agency, our cultural sector partner, there was an extension and diversification of its discursive and educational programming, an increase in its publishing outputs, as well as an expansion of its user constituencies in terms of reach and diversity. The work created active collaborations with new media and visual arts organisations; helped transform LADA's publishing activities towards accessible moving image production and distribution; created greater interaction with broadcast media professionals; and extended the organisation's user community in terms of scale and genres of interest.

Media professionals and curators were involved in discussion of this project's processes and outcomes creating further pathways to impact in a range of film festivals and programmes, galleries, critical reviews and other cultural events. 

Crossovers enhanced and shaped an interest in performance and its discourses in the public sphere, through debate at the screening events, and through the negotiation of further dissemination of Crossover titles through screenings, exhibition and DVD sales. These filmic works impacted beyond the national context with many international screenings of the works and in one instance translation and subtitling into another language.
The wide audiences for these works strengthened, deepened and enhanced high quality engagement with performance-related cultures and thinking.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>807870FA-C4AB-40DD-B879-6AD7E478A824</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546395f796ceb0.78411292</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project produced, screened, distributed through DVD, and critically contextualized seven artistic and documentary film works evolved from the previous three years of Performance Matters research. These films looked at the multiple histories of performance art as it engages with mainstream TV, appears on the internet, in subculture, in stand-up comedy and in avant-garde art. Other documentary films explored ideas of performance in contemporary thought, through conversations with internationally renowned thinkers working at the forefront of their disciplines. Screening, contextualizing events and liaison work with broadcast and media professionals sought to embed and extend the avenues of dissemination, cultural influence and audiences for these works and their associated ideas. The project explored and demonstrated the increasing cultural force of performance in culture and in critical thought, making distinctive contributions to documentary practice, artist's film and video and the essay-film. It involved contributors and performance audiences that hitherto have been remote from academia, thereby expanding the stakeholders of contemporary performance research beyond the Higher Education sector.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research outputs of this project are of interest and use to artists, curators, critics and general audiences wishing to find extended reflection upon the history, forms and ideas associated with performance and live art. They present accessible filmic approaches to a range of artists, art works and thinkers with an important impact on contemporary cultural production. The outputs will be of particular interest to media and broadcast professionals who are seeking to provide exposure to this cutting-edge creative and critical work for a broad public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>656A37D0-DD51-4E96-B223-E3017A8F3601</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1268816703.24952967760367a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K003461/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>287497FB-DD4A-44CC-AC13-DBAFADC9AD82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A41F90B5-A81F-42AC-908A-49DB7154F85A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art Theory &amp; Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4DC83A15-ACD4-4667-BA6F-2DB8EFCF166F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theories Of Theatre</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02EB1D72-607A-4467-BF3A-A60E567738E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Time-Based Media HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
