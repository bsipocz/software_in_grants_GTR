But why is this, how did this come about, and what roles can palaeontology play within wider public debate? This network seeks to answer these questions, bringing together an international group of humanities and social sciences scholars, scientists, museum professionals and participants from the cultural sector. Mixing theoretical and practical discussions on the public circulation of scientific ideas, we will investigate the dynamics and importance of palaeontological concepts in the modern world, while also developing new understandings and methods for science communication more generally. 

A series of workshops and associated public engagement events will investigate how palaeontological ideas have interacted with public debates, both in the present and historically. We will examine the reasons why palaeontologists have engaged with the public, why public audiences have been interested in palaeontology, and how these interests have impacted on one another - sometimes collaboratively, and sometimes tensely. We will consider the different ways that palaeontological ideas and objects have been presented through science books, lectures, talks, artworks, film, computer games, and other media. We will also consider how and why some subjects - such as dinosaurs, exotic fieldwork, and human origins - have increasingly dominated public presentations, while other aspects of the field have often been neglected or seen as problematic. These discussions will lead to consideration of new directions which palaeontological outreach and engagement can take, whether this be to new audiences, new genres, new agendas, and engagement with wider concepts and issues. In doing so, we will seek to provide new perspectives on the role and character of science in public life, and on the background to wider debates on evolution, nature and the environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network will have an integrated impact strategy, linking the workshops with public engagement events and a concerted program of online activity. This strategy will allow us to promote the activities of the network, and involve public audiences in our discussions, inspiring reflections on the background, practices and potentials of the public discussion of palaeontological ideas. 

A program of online activity will take advantage of the expertise of members of the network to reach a wide audience. Much of the new presentation of palaeontological research has been conducted through new and online media, particularly social media, online journalism and podcasts. The writers for major blogs and creators of podcasts like The Guardian's Lost Worlds series (Mark Carnall, Elsa Panciroili), Tetrapod Zoology (Darren Naish, John Conway), Palaeocast (Dave Marshall, Elizabeth Martin) and Laelaps (Brian Switek) are key contributors to the network. Details of the network's activities will therefore be discussed on science and palaeontology blogs, news-stories, and podcasts. The network itself will have its own online presence, which will be integrated within the above networks. It will be coordinated and publicized through an online platform based at www.poppalaeo.com (set up for the exploratory workshop held last year). This will feature accessibly written blogposts from the network participants, and host videos of talks, events and discussions at the workshops. 

The second strand of public dissemination will take advantage of the network's museum links and cultural partners to host public events. Each workshop will feature a public lecture or discussion, which will be free for ticketed members of the public. These will be held in the institutions hosting the workshops (King's College London, the Teylers Museum, and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences), and would aim for an attendance of 50-150 people each. These will include: a one-evening pop-up exhibition; a panel discussion on the history of palaeontological concepts; a fossil handling and reconstruction session; and a discussion and film screening on palaeontology in the media. Through hosting these events, we will be able to build the profile of the network, test new means of public engagement, and a springboard for future activity. These public events would also include recorded segments, to be hosted on the online platform. 

The workshops would not just involve impact and public dissemination activities, but will also aim to develop new methods of impact and public dissemination. Through forming a cross-disciplinary network, and engaging with the research and public context discussed above, we will be able to build new strategies and agendas in the public discussion of science which could be adopted by other projects in the future. Through working with museums, science communicators, broadcasters, journalists and artists, we will aim to reassess and develop the ways in which palaeontological ideas and models are depicted in public, integrate insights from a variety of different sectors, and encourage debate, discussions and potentially diversification of palaeontological presentations in the wider public arena. 

It is also anticipated that this strategy will develop considerably through the workshop discussions, which will generate ideas for new impact activity. The PI, CI and other participants will aim to promote the activities of the network and its discussions through articles and submissions to the online platforms and print media, and take advantage of opportunities for wider public engagement through exhibitions, the media and public events as they arise.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R007411/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
