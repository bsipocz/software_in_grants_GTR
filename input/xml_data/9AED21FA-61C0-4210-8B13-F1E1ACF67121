These changes have been recognised, but the historical impact of this transition in the period after 1950 has not been fully explored. The structure of local governance increasingly excluded many social groups, especially from planning decisions. These, however, had a profound impact on large areas of the country and especially on urban Britain. Long-term historical social changes accelerated this growing dislocation between local government and the community. On the one hand, a new post-war discourse emerged around notions of welfare as well civil and consumer rights which gradually changed social expectations and aspirations. The failure of government (local and national) to deliver in, for example, housing led to frustration and dissent. On the other hand, established communities were physically broken-up due to both slum clearance programmes and changes in the patterns of tenure. Consequently, social networks were irrevocably eroded. Social cohesion deteriorated as civil society declined. Furthermore, changes to local government undermined their position as an integral part of civil society, creating an ever increasing gap between the council and the community. The result was increasing disaffection and, in some areas, a breakdown in social stability. 

The project will highlight this long historical process of change and fragmentation. It will examine the legislative changes to local service delivery, social change and attempts by the state (through local authorities and other institutions) to bridge the gap between 'government' and 'community' through key policy initiatives such as participation schemes and various community development initiatives. These were part of a top-down approach in the 1970s, often experimental, to include people in the planning system by developing participatory democracy. They constituted a state-led attempt to react to the aftermath of economic, social and physical changes to many communities by creating a sense of community by providing basic facilities and by forming teams of professionals who were instructed to work in the communities and to help local people to create civil groups which reflected their interests. They worked in some of the most deprived areas of Britain, including inner city London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and Glasgow. 

Yet the schemes floundered and the problems continued. The community teams themselves became disenchanted at the scale and structural nature of the problems they faced. Moreover, local disillusionment amongst many residents reflected a lack of identity, pride and connection to the community. Poverty, unemployment and racism underpinned the growing social fragmentation. State policies floundered in these areas, leading to a breakdown in community relations which was underlined with the urban riots in many inner city areas such as St. Paul's, Moss Side, Toxteth and Brixton. These riots raised many issues related to the deterioration in community relations, social stability and a breakdown in trust, especially between the communities and various public bodies and institutions. They were the culmination of years of neglect and the erosion of social cohesion. Appreciating the historical process is necessary to identify and fully understand the challenges, social changes and political policies and structures which led to this growing fragmentation in some inner-city communities. 

Completing this monograph will, therefore, add to our knowledge and appreciation of what continues to be an important and topical issue.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By placing the issue of governance and social exclusion into the historic context this project will benefit policy makers and practitioners alike who are concerned with developing community structures and relations as well as social stability and cohesion.

The general potential beneficiaries include:
1. academia (history, politics, social policy, sociology, human geography).
public sector/policy-makers within national, local, devolved and national government. 
2. government agencies (national, regional and local).
3. third sector (civil society groups).
4. general public (developing improved community relations).

The research has the potential to contribute to community relations by increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy.

Pathways:
I am currently organising a conference to be held in Bangor on September 13-14 2012 (supported by the College). This links directly into the key issues to be explored in the project. The conference, History, Communities and Social Cohesion, will bring together historians and academics from other disciplines, especially social sciences. It will also include policy practitioners, including representatives from the Welsh Assembly Governments Department for Social Justice and Local Government. Invitations have also been made to Department for Communities and local authorities. The aim of this conference is to address a number of interrelated topics central to the building of communities. In particular, it will be structured around two key questions:

1. how do you create, maintain and develop sustainable communities?
2. how do you achieve cohesion and stability?

The aim is to look at these issues in both a historical and contemporary context and to promote debate and ideas between academics and practitioners.

In 2013 it is intended to host two workshops which will have a more narrow focus than the conference. These will look at civil society, social stability and local government. Again the intention is to bring together academics from different disciplines and policy practitioners to debate and discuss the ideas coming from the project and to place these in a broader context. The lessons about the limitations of state action in creating cohesive and stable communities are not restricted to parts of inner city Britain but can, and will, be applied contemporaneously to all areas of the country.

Building on exisiting work with policy makers as a Specialist Groups Advisor (for the Communities and Local Government Committee), and by developing new contacts made from the workshops, further consultancy work will lead to greater interaction with practitioners from all levels of government and the Third Sector.

The conference and workshops will be promoted and supported by a web site to be designed by the Bangor IT department. This will be developed further as an information and educational tool for the general public.

Track record:
I have organised a number of international conferences and panel sessions. 
I have taken part in a number of important workshops 
I have also advised television and radio programmes on numerous occasions.
I have advised and made contributions to industry practitioners publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68687</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>workshop on community building - the role of governments</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E99CC571-A281-4194-B3A3-B26C401B28BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organized workshops, 10 May 2013, 'Community, stability and the public sector,' Participants included a range of academics in the morning sessions and Lord Dafydd Ellis Thomas, Albert Owen MP, the Leader of Conwy Council and representatives from the Welsh Assembly in the afternoon session.

Workshop 1

Programme
Community Building
Community building, or community development, has been a concern of the state, local government and voluntary agencies since the 1960s and the 'rediscovery' of poverty. From the late-1960s and throughout the 1970s, successive governments initiated a number of action-research pilot projects, such as the Education Priority Areas, Community Development Projects, Neighbourhood Schemes, Quality of Life programmes, Six Town Studies and Comprehensive Communities Programme. The problem was defined in terms of 'individual pathologies' and 'transmitted deprivation.' Community development focused on creating self-help and mutual aid groups to address what was perceived as problem from within certain largely urban areas. However, these projects were fraught with problems, not least of which was the profound structural economic problems facing old industrial areas, rural and urban.
Governments were accused of little more than tokenism. Increasingly, under Labour and then Conservative governments, community development became centred on the fundamental need for economic regeneration. This, however, did not necessarily lead to the type of community development needed for the poor and disadvantaged. Since the late-1990s, the state, local authorities and devolved assemblies and a range of voluntary organisations have attempted to redress the balance in policy and approaches to community development. These workshops will raise and debate some of the issues, historical and contemporary, in community development:

Specifically, it looks at:

1. The impact of policies, economic developments and social change on inner city communities.
2. State reactions - Plowden Seebohm, Skeffington and Redcliffe-Maud reports.
Then it focuses on a range of pilot projects, including:
3. Education Priority Areas.
4. The Community Development Project and the Inner Area Studies
Then it focuses on what these projects published about the problems and challenges they faced in:
5. Housing.
6. Local government relations with communities.
7. Developing mutual aid. 
8. Economic decline.
Then it looks at small projects:
9. The Neighbourhood Scheme and the Comprehensive Communities 

This research looks at how the major paradigm defining urban deprivation and state solutions (built around state planning and welfare models) gradually morphed with notions of urban renewal to create an approach based on regeneration. In effect, this research identifies the time when the language of regeneration starts to define the issue of deprivation and of answers to resolving the problem. Both the Inner Areas Act and the idea of Partnerships were introduced as a way of securing both economic and social development.

The main themes explored include:
The failure of post-war state policies to challenge social division and relative poverty, especially in housing, managing economic change and immigration.
The limits of area based initiatives.
The limits of pilot projects.
The failure of social planning.
The struggle to develop a coherent urban policy.
The drift towards regeneration with an increasing emphasis on economic rather than community/social development as the model for effective change to the inner city.

In summary, the project looks at both policy and the results/limits of the projects and reforms introduced by successive governments. It looks at the shifts between paradigms, between community development, welfare and planning as a solution to community fragmentation, between urban renewal through physical redevelopment and at an emerging set of ideas based on the notion of regeneration.

It also looks at continuities. A discourse around perceptions of the causes and possible solutions to deprivation provided the framework in which policy-makers operated. This discourse highlights the continuing importance of political economy, of the values in classic/neo-liberalism and progressive liberalism in shaping policy. Consequently, it shows how the urban poor continued to be marginalized. not just by economic circumstance, but by socio-cultural prejudice and discrimination and how policy failed to recognize or address these fundamental problems.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key findings might be of interest and use for policymakers and stakeholders. Althugh I have already held two workshops (funded by the AHRC), now the research is so much more advanced I would like to organize further workshops to disseminate the research and to feed it into contemporary debates and discussions on deprivation, governance and state policies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6C0796E0-79BC-4485-AFA9-E44D8CE336BD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b891d7227b7.50372934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3C3AB0A8-E93A-4E46-96E2-5D31584D1D75</gtr:id><gtr:title>Deprivation, State Interventions and Urban Communities in Britain, 1968-79</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e798887255d633b6d848cace297acca"><gtr:id>4e798887255d633b6d848cace297acca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shapely, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>ISBN 978-1-4094-5162-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545b89fa3a0e02.45413608</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J008052/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
