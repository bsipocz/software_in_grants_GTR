Telomeres consist of specific DNA sequences and associated binding proteins that protect chromosomes from DNA damage. One of the main factors that affect DNA damage and repair is the chromatin context within which the DNA damage occurs. Chromatin is the native form that all eukaryotic genomes are found as; not as naked DNA but rather as a combination of DNA with proteins that compacts genomic DNA to fit into the nucleus. Chromatin has a profound effect on all processes that require access to genomic DNA. Therefore the cell has developed means of regulating chromatin structure. One of the most important of these is the action of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes (Snf2 proteins). These Snf2 enzymes use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to change chromatin structure and thereby alter the accessibility of the underlying DNA.

Snf2 proteins are known to regulate DNA repair throughout chromosomes. However, their function at telomeres is much less understood. This is important to address as mutations in some Snf2 proteins are linked to inappropriate DNA repair at telomeres that define a subset of human cancers. Therefore, we need to understand the nature of chromatin remodelling at telomeres and how this affects DNA repair. 

This is a complex topic and therefore our best chance of understanding the underlying mechanisms lie in studying model organisms with simplified DNA repair and chromatin remodelling pathways. We will use budding yeast, a single-celled eukaryote that for many years has pioneered our understanding of how chromatin affects DNA repair. The budding yeast Snf2 protein Uls1 was recently found to bind telomeres and its deletion results in telomere fusions (a type of inappropriate DNA repair). Our research will address how Uls1 works, what its remodelling and why this affects telomeres. 

An additional aspect of Uls1 that makes it worthy of study is its connection to SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like modifier). Cells commonly use the attachment of reversible marks (post-translational modifications) to proteins as molecular switches and SUMO is one such modification. However, in the context of DNA damage, SUMO is particularly important as it regulates DNA repair processes. How Uls1 co-ordinates chromatin remodelling with changes in sumoylation status may reveal novel insight into telomeres and DNA repair. 

This work will begin to answer fundamental questions about the nature of chromatin remodelling at telomeres: a basic biological problem. It will also lay the foundation for future research into the links between chromatin remodelling, SUMO modification and telomere maintenance that may have translational impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes (Snf2 proteins) play key roles during DNA damage signalling by 1) opening up chromatin structure to allow repair and 2) re-establishing the correct chromatin configuration once repair has finished. Their importance in DNA repair is highlighted by the fact that mutations in several Snf2 proteins are linked to cancers. However, the role of Snf2 proteins at telomeres is much less understood. Telomere maintenance shares many aspects in common with DNA repair. The recruitment of DNA repair proteins to telomeres is required for normal telomere maintenance by telomerase. However telomeres need to supress DNA damage signalling to prevent DNA repair resulting in telomere fusions or recombination.
Recent data suggests that telomeric chromatin structure strongly affects how prone telomeres are to recombination. Moreover, mutations in Snf2 proteins are linked to increased telomere recombination. However, the precise function of chromatin remodelling at telomeres and how this promotes telomere integrity are unclear.
This proposal will tackle this by studying the budding yeast Snf2 protein, Uls1, which binds telomeres and whose deletion results in increased telomere fusions. By using a combination of cell biology and biochemistry, we will characterise Uls1 function. Identifying the proteins it interacts with and its genome-wide localisation. This will be used to generate hypothesis regarding the identity of its substrates and these will be subsequently testing using in vitro biochemical assays. 
We will also study Uls1's SUMO targeted Ubiquitin ligase (StUbl) activity by identifying Uls1 SUMO targets. The role of Uls1 in changing telomeric chromatin structure in vivo will be assayed directly using the dam methylase. We will achieve a complete molecular understanding of Uls1 and why it is required for telomere integrity. This work in budding yeast will be a model for understanding chromatin remodelling at telomeres in other species.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>I will aim to achieve greater impact in a number of ways:

1) Academic impact. Chromatin remodelling is a fundamental biological process and chromatin remodelling enzymes are found in all eukaryotes. Therefore our research has the potential to make significant theoretical advances in basic biology. Telomeres need to suppress DNA damage signalling but counterintuitively these same DNA damage proteins are recruited to and required for normal telomere maintenance. This is one of the oldest unsolved mysteries of telomere research and it would be fascinating if chromatin remodelling held the key to solving this mystery. I will communicate our results via scientific conferences and via publications.

2) Public outreach. I will strive to promote a greater public understanding of science. This will benefit the public but also the wider scientific community by highlighting the role each plays for the other. I will communicate with the public about general science but also of the specific benefits of basic biological research using model organisms and how they have helped human health. I will achieve this via outreach activities such as the Fife science festival and via talks to the general public via the brightclub.

3) Scientific training. As part of this grant I will recruit a post-doctoral research associate (PDRA). During the course of this project, I will have to opportunity to train him/her in yeast molecular biology, live cell imaging and chromatin biochemistry. Moreover, they will also have access to the award-winning career development courses offered at St Andrews via CAPOD. I will mentor the PDRA to promote their career progression. 

4) Societal/translational impact. Aging-related illnesses and cancer represent a major health and financial burden both in the UK and worldwide. Telomeres act as cellular clocks and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes have a major impact on cancer. Indeed, SWI/SNF is the most commonly mutated chromatin regulating complex in human cancers. Therefore understanding how these processes are linked can open up new means of tackling cancer and cellular aging. However, before this can happen, we need a detailed mechanistic understanding of the enzymes and processes involved. It is precisely this that our work aims to address. 

5) Commercial exploitation. I do not envision that there are any immediate opportunities for commercial exploitation of our work. However, should this change, I will take advantage of this to patent and/or licence any technologies resulting from our work. I have familiarised myself with the relevant authorities within St Andrews (Knowledge Transfer Centre). This will benefit the University of St Andrews and help to grow the UK's science economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>435253</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>European Researchers Night</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F462B7E1-8722-46F2-99EB-96093818DDF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On Friday 25th September from 19.00- 23.00 we held a ResearchLIVE! event as part of the EU Researcher's Night celebrations. I was involved in setting up a stand with posters and two microscopes to introduce the general public to the use of model organisms (Yeasts, C. elegans and D. melanogaster) as well as GFP in modern biological research. Members of the general public were invited to use the microscopes to look at different fluorescent animals as we talked to them about how we use these in our research. We had a capacity audience of 248. It drew audiences from as far as Kirkcaldy including scout groups from SIMD areas. 
Outcomes and impacts include requests from uniformed youth groups for further interaction, development of further training in practical PE for researchers and inclusion the funding bid for Exploration 2016/2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5a4442512e0.51633710</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.facebook.com/events/789375151161712/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M008142/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6FACFC06-C057-4BBC-8936-6881298CB318</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ageing: chemistry/biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6EF57B2-8ACD-48E6-9B45-98507446B053</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigenetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
