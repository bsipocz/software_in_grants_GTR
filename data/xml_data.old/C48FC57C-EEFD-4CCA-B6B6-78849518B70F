Fertility is a key determinant of profitability in commercial broiler breeder operations, and remains a considerable limiting factor in broiler productivity in the UK. Marginal (~1%) reductions in fertility cost the poultry industry millions of pounds annually, so the economic benefits of optimizing fertility are obvious. High flock fertility can also be associated with increased bird welfare. As one of the world's premier broiler breeding companies, Aviagen Ltd is a major supplier of grandparent broiler breeder stock to UK industry and globally. The Aviagen breeding program seeks to optimise a range of traits related to reproduction, health, production, environmental impact, robustness, food security, welfare, sustainability, and involves the assessment of &amp;gt;1,000,000 chickens annually. Key to Aviagen's balanced breeding goal is a strong focus to improve reproductive performance, by determining factors underpinning variation in fertility. Variation in broiler fertility has multiple sources: our preliminary analysis of 18 recent Aviagen broiler breeder flocks reveals significant fertility variation across different flocks, within flocks across different individuals, and within individuals as they age over time. This trend is reflected on a national scale. The European Ross 308 breeder (the major UK broiler breed supplied by Aviagen) has a 40-week target hatchability of 83%, but shows large variation in hatchability across UK flocks. While measures to improve fertility can be adopted, such as assisting flocks with replacement males, these measures are not always cost-efficient or effective. Clearly, fertility in broiler breeders has a complex, multifactorial nature, which can only be resolved by simultaneously considering multiple proximate behavioural, physiological and genetic mechanisms. Improved understanding of these correlated factors offers the opportunity for developing new selection and management tools to optimize genetic progress, bird management and thus animal balance and welfare. Key to this pluralistic approach is an understanding of the evolutionary significance of fertility-related traits, and the
way these have changed in broiler chickens through domestication and selection. Here, we propose a Stand Alone LINK research grant, which seeks to resolve the mechanisms underpinning infertility in British broiler breeder commercial stocks, which capitalizes on the synergistic combination of the expertise of TP's lab in the evolutionary ecology of chicken reproductive behaviour and fertility dynamics, and Aviagen research infrastructure and resources and extensive expertise of broiler breeder production and fertility in the UK. Three factors make this project particularly novel and robust. First, a novel automated genotyping technique recently developed by Aviagen, which enables high-throughput, real time parallel parentage assignment in pedigree broiler breeder flocks. Second, a series of quantitative tools and immune-physiological assays newly developed by TP's lab to study fertility at multiple levels, from the social structure of entire populations to in vitro molecular interactions. Third, a well-established partnership between TP and Aviagen through a CASE PhD scholarship, which is generating substantial preliminary results that inform the hypotheses and approaches proposed. We aim to harness these breakthroughs to identify the causes of variation in fertility in Aviagen broiler breeder stocks at three integrated levels: (1) social mechanisms, (2) inherent male or female factors, and (3) male*female incompatibilities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Resolving the mechanisms underpinning variation in fertility is a key challenge in livestock production, where breeding for increasing efficiency of resource use has drastic knock-on effects on fertility rates.

1) The main beneficiary of this research will be the POULTRY INDUSTRY in general, and the UK BROILER INDUSTRY in particular. 
2) A related beneficiary will be DEFRA in its priority to improve the productivity and competitiveness of British food and farming businesses.
3) NGOs, learned societies and 3rd sector organisations focused on ANIMAL WELFARE (e.g. RSPCA, ASAB).
4) The GENERAL PUBLIC will also be a beneficiary of this research due to the tremendous interest in issues associated with the Food Industry, Food Safety and Animal Welfare. 

How will they benefit from this research? 
1-2) By ameliorating infertility problems of the broiler breeder industry the proposed research will foster global economic performance, and specifically the economic competitiveness of the British poultry industry. 
3) Infertility problems are likely to be associated with poor welfare of the flock, especially through suboptimal mating behaviours, intra- and inter-sexual aggression, which can lead to severe (lethal or sublethal) consequences for members of the flock. 
4) By generating new knowledge and disseminating information on the different causes of infertility and how science can help the industry develop more efficient and animal friendly ways to manage flock fertility.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>415155</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU Munich)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof Bernd Kaspers, Institut f&amp;uuml;r Tierphysiologie, University of Munich, Germany</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E045B0B-B0E6-463E-91C3-7EB390635000</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is expected to make a key contribution to future publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2bb153789c4.34704906-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Access to knock-out birds (homozygotes and heterozygote controls) for experimental work.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration seeks to harness the power of chicken genetic knockout lines developed in Munich to establish the causal effect of antibody response in sperm agglutination.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at local primary school (S.S.

This evidence comes from (1) Long-term datasets of domestic flocks, and (2) Behavioural studies of domestic and red junglefowl flocks. 

1. Studies of long-term datasets generated the following key results. This work presented three key results:
i. Domestic flocks are variable in their overall levels of fertility and groups tend to experience a decline in fertility late in life.
ii. Males are highly variable in their lifetime offspring production (Figure 7) and this variability was common across replicated mating groups.
iii. Males were highly repeatable in their weekly offspring production across replicated mating groups. This suggests that some males consistently perform well across their lifetime while other males consistently perform poorly.

2. Behavioural studies have illuminated four key results:
i) Male and females displayed striking variation in their rates of sexual behavior within groups. 
ii) The observed variation in male and female mating behavior was strongly related to offspring production. Firstly, individual male offspring production was strongly related to male behavioural rates of sexual behaviour. Secondly, female fertility was also related to the frequency of female mating behavior. Thirdly, the relationship between sexual behavior and offspring production extended beyond the period of observation (Figure 3). In other words, male lifetime reproductive success and whole group fertility were strongly related to the frequency of sexual behavior in early life.
iii) The frequency of sexual behavior declined with the age of groups. Our results of domestic flocks indicate that groups observed 5-8 weeks after commencing production displayed higher rates of sexual behavior than when observed later in life (15-18 weeks after commencing production). Suggesting a role for declines in the sexual behavior of groups to influence the observed late life decline in fertility.
iv) In red junglefowl groups these patterns are mediated by male age and aggression. A male's reproductive success was determined by the number of females mated (precopulatory sexual selection) and his paternity share, which was driven by the polyandry of his female partners (postcopulatory sexual selection). Pre- and postcopulatory components of male reproductive success covaried positively, and males with high mating success also had high paternity share. Two male phenotypes affected male pre- and postcopulatory performance: average aggressiveness towards rival males, a trait linked to social status, and age. Aggressive males mated with more females and more often with individual females, resulting in higher sexual exclusivity than for less aggressive males. Similarly, younger males mated with more females and more often with individual females, suffering less intense sperm competition than older males. Older males had a lower paternity share even allowing for their limited sexual exclusivity, indicating they may also produce less competitive ejaculates.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of this research are expected to inform the husbandry and farming protocols of the broiler industry in order to maximise fertility.
