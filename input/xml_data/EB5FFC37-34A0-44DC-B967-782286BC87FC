Formed by two Cambridge University undergraduates in May 1968, Henry Cow existed for ten years, producing some of the most complex, varied, and imaginative music of the 1970s. The group cycled through more than ten musicians in various combinations, but its steadiest membership included multi-instrumentalist Fred Frith, saxophonist and keyboard player Tim Hodgkinson, percussionist Chris Cutler, bassist John Greaves, oboist and bassoonist Lindsay Cooper, vocalist Dagmar Krause, and bassist Georgina Born. Its music ranged widely across different styles: precise, electrified chamber music; jazzy solos with accompaniment; wild group improvisations; live electronic music and studio experimentation; rhythmically propulsive rock; art and cabaret songs; and multi-sectional suites comprising several or all of these styles. Although they released several albums, Henry Cow was primarily a performing ensemble, and toured extensively throughout Europe and Scandinavia, where they found enthusiastic audiences and likeminded musicians working in the spaces between traditional musical genres. \n Henry Cow and its former members recorded and performed with a wide variety of musicians. In the rock world, their partners included Robert Wyatt of Soft Machine, Dave Stewart of Egg, Mike Oldfield, Captain Beefheart, Faust, the Residents, and Brian Eno. Among the classically trained composers with whom the band engaged were Roger Smalley, Heiner Goebbels, Michael Nyman, and Cornelius Cardew. The list of well respected improvisers who collaborated with members of Henry Cow included Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill, Annemarie Roelofs, Steve Beresford, Irene Schweizer, Phil Minton, Maggie Nichols, Sally Potter, Zeena Parkins, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago. This broad network of cultural production evidences a web of attachments characteristic of British experimentalism.\n The members of Henry Cow often remarked on their indebtedness to American experimental music in the 1950s and 1960s. These transatlantic connections originated in three sources: John Cage and his successors in the downtown New York milieu, Ornette Coleman and the free jazz movement, and the adventurous rock-identified ensembles of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. A central issue for this study, then, is how Henry Cow, as well as its wide range of collaborators, received these American musical traditions and adapted them to fit into a British cultural context. This project will not, however, limit itself to matters of reception, for its overall goal is to document and analyse the entire field of British experimental music in the 1970s. In what ways did the jazzers, rockers, improvisers, and composers interact with each other? \n Although Henry Cow performed many pieces of through-composed and notated music, its prevailing musical practice was improvisation. Unlike many of their contemporaries in the British free improvisation scene, the band often added recognizable licks and vamps into its spontaneous music making, creating space in its group dialogues for a sense of musical history and style. This kind of referentiality was anathema to the free improvisation movement, which was more invested in purging all recognizable musical signs from their playing in search of a 'blank slate' state that could condition the interactions of the group. I will seek to investigate further the different meanings that improvisation acquired for the various scenes of spontaneous music-making in the UK, and what different musical protagonists-rock bands, 'free' music ensembles, and trained composers-felt they could gain by turning to improvisation in this period.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Any research project concerned with popular music is prima facie one that will address non-academic beneficiaries. The central protagonists in my narrative, Henry Cow, shared large concert stages with Pink Floyd, the Velvet Underground, Mike Oldfield, and Captain Beefheart. In other words, Henry Cow was a successful rock band with thousands of fans. This community has persisted into the present day, when websites devoted to Henry Cow attest to a continuing popular interest in the band and its members. \n\nThus, by simply engaging with the popularity of a popular music group-by virtue of its very subject-No More Songs will garner the attention of readers outside of academia. For this community of listeners devoted to the contemporary genre-crossing, hybrid musical networks of adventurous rock, free improvisation, live electronic music, and new music, my project will foster community identity by providing a detailed history of the scene and shedding light on the various traditions that have produced today's musical landscape. This history will also be important to those musical practitioners who emphasize improvisation in their work. \n\nNo More Songs will, necessarily, make its impact at a single point in time, although reviews will continue to keep it in the public view for anything up to three years after publication. The University of California Press, who I expect will publish the work, will ensure that the book is sent for review in more popular journals in addition to the obvious peer-reviewed scholarly journals that carry reviews; these mainstream sources will include Jazzwise, The Wire, Musicworks, and Signal to Noise, in addition to important online magazines such as All About Jazz, Perfect Sound Forever, Paris Transatlantic, Splendid E-zine, and Point of Departure. The monograph will also be available as an e-book as a matter of course, and to judge from the PI's previous monograph with UCal Press (Experimentalism Otherwise: The New York Avant-Garde and its Limits, 2011), the current work will also be published in paperback at a cost affordable to those without access to scholarly libraries.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to plan so many years in advance, the promotion of No More Songs will likely involve broadcast media and concerts. A noncommercial, 'sound art' radio station based in London and streaming online around the world, Resonance FM would be the perfect fit for a series of radio programs discussing the book and presenting music from the history it outlines. The PI has cultivated personal ties to staff members at the station, and members of Henry Cow also enjoy close relations with the institution. A short series of broadcasts promoting the book would reach listeners worldwide, enhance the understanding of British music in the minds of this audience, and will likely trigger interest in such other media as Radio 3 and BBC 3 and 4. To celebrate the publication of the monograph, it is also likely that the PI will organize a series of concerts, featuring former members of Henry Cow and their musical collaborators. Again, it is far too early to predict the details of such an event, but London's Caf&amp;eacute; Oto presents one obvious venue-as the unofficial home of London's experimental music scene, the caf&amp;eacute; has hosted concerts by most of the members of the band over the years. In both of these cases-radio and concerts-the monograph will provide innovative content for British cultural industries.\n\nAlthough the oral history archive associated with this project is a specialized resource, and thus not directed at the general public, the stories it will contain will doubtless be useful to cultural producers-concert promoters, record labels, radio broadcasters, and writers of program and liner notes-for years to come.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64046</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I022511/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
