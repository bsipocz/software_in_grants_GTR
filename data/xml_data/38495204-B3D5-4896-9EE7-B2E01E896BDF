However, there is still a dearth of serious academic research that could inform policy and practice in digital as well as sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation. There is a particular paucity of research on how early-stage entrepreneurs utilise supportive infrastructures such as innovation hubs (Gryszkiewicz &amp;amp; Friederici 2014) along their creative trajectories. As a result, our understanding of digital entrepreneurs in the UK remains rather limited and (mis)informed by scholarship that disproportionately emanates from North America. 

To address this void, the present study investigates frontline innovators and their trajectories within London's rapidly growing digital economy, complementing recent macro-level surveys by government-related agencies. It is guided by the assumption that promising digital business models-including the models that underpin TransferWise and Funding Circle (both of which are London-based startups)-typically develop within collaborative networks of digital entrepreneurs. The main research question posed is: How exactly do person-to-person interactions that unfold within such networks shape original business ideas that (in some cases) lead to success? This study proposes that digital business models emerge via a fluid process of 'networked creativity' whereby entrepreneurs engage in a series of creative interactions with relevant others. The immediate setting for the study is London's 'hubscape' (its interlinked innovation hubs, their various events and shared collaborative culture) where entrepreneurs interested in technology, profit-making, fairness, sustainability and transformative change all find supportive bases.

This project transcends existing organisational and entrepreneurship research by examining three types of digital entrepreneurs (for-profit, social-ecological, and transformative) and by making two radical design choices: First, it tracks actual creative interactions (Hargadon 2002; Hargadon &amp;amp; Bechky 2006; Long Lingo &amp;amp; O'Mahony 2010) between early-stage entrepreneurs and their interlocutors. Second, it recasts the business model as a so-called boundary object (Star &amp;amp; Griesemer 1989; Carlile 2002)-a schema that diverse participants can 'work on' without fully agreeing about its details. It then brings these elements into a coherent research design that shows how the evolution of entrepreneurial business models can be traced with precision at each step (see Case for Support). The study draws inspiration from connective ethnography in developing a unique approach to 'following' both entrepreneurs and their emergent models at the micro-sociological level. 

Among the very first serious studies to directly examine collective creativity along individualised entrepreneurial trajectories, this inquiry will make a transformative contribution to academic research as well as policy and practice. It will challenge purely individualistic ('hero') models of entrepreneurial action and ideation (that are partly rooted in Joseph Schumpeter's classic work) by demonstrating how, as Sautet (2002) has previously suggested, the challenge of entrepreneurship in this era of high-tech and complexity is how to bring together knowledge that is distributed across different individuals so as to create value. It will craft a highly potent account of entrepreneurship that fully reflects our societies' transition to knowledge-intensive work, collaborative networks and increasingly collectively-driven creativity. As such, it hopes to spur a series of related studies by a range of scholars. Through a solid impact strategy based on continuous engagement with key stakeholders (primarily, innovation hub staff and founders) and the media, this study will shift mindsets, behaviours and institutional practices with the ultimate goal of boosting the creativity and success of digital and sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is expected that this study will exert a significant social and economic impact beyond academia. This will be achieved through continuous engagement with clearly identified stakeholder groups, in addition to the wide dissemination of research results via academic and non-academic media outlets. Prominent London-based organisations tasked with catalysing digital entrepreneurship, including innovation hubs in particular, but also labs and accelerators, constitute the primary stakeholder group (though this inquiry will also be relevant for similar organisations in other regions within the UK and globally). This summary names the most important stakeholders, outlines their core knowledge needs and briefly explains how impact will be ensured. 

(1) Key stakeholder organisations in London: Central stakeholder organisations in London include the Digital Catapult Centre, Impact Hub Westminster (where the PI is a member), Impact Hub Islington, Hub Youth Academy (which is a programme based at Impact Hub Islington rather than a hub organisation as such), Future Cities Catapult and Level39. The PI has held substantial in-person discussions about this project with staff at the first four organisations, all of which have expressed their willingness to cooperate (e.g. by giving access to prospective research subjects and attending workshops, based on mutually agreed-upon conditions). These hubs host hundreds of digital entrepreneurs and continuously explore new ways to accelerate their members' work. They are thus highly likely to benefit from this project. 

Other stakeholders will include (1) early-stage entrepreneurs who stand to benefit from new insights into how entrepreneurial ideas evolve in practice (in contrast to the heavily stylised popular literature); (2) national and local governments that have promote digital and sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship (e.g. the UK's Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills and Innovate UK); (3) lawyers and legal scholars considering the nature of creativity, innovation and intellectual property with reference to collective creativity and collective knowledge (or knowledge as a public good); (4) sustainability scientists who lack familiarity with entrepreneurial methods for reworking the economy around sustainability goals. The wider public will benefit from an alternative understanding of digital innovation and of entrepreneurship as a driver of greater sustainability. 

(2) Stakeholders' knowledge needs: Consultations with the above-mentioned innovation hubs have revealed that they have special needs in relation to (a) tracking users (staff wish to know in richer detail about the prior backgrounds of particular users and about their activity patterns); (b) demonstrating impact (staff are keen to better conceptualise and demonstrate their organisations' impact); (c) understanding the full context of support (staff are aware that entrepreneurs use hubs as only one among many resources; they see a need for a more accurate of picture of the relative role of hubs).

The present project's findings will be able to respond to each of these needs. Moreover, the proposed project will be among the first to systematically examine actual creative interactions at and around hubs--a vital but under-researched part of their support processes.

(3) Ensuring that impact is delivered properly: Impact will be ensured through continuous engagement with stakeholder groups (which will produce trust to facilitate substantial knowledge transfer and co-construction of recommendations, innovation support frameworks and online publications, etc.). This project will follow a five-step impact delivery plan as detailed in the attached Pathways to Impact document.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196473</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our grant period started in May 2016 and will conclude in November 2017. We are currently in the middle of empirical data collection but we are also pursuing a concurrent impact strategy consisting mainly of practitioner workshops (coworking space founders and hosts). We briefly describe these activities here. Readers should note that these are early-stage impact activities that, while generating impactful interactions with stakeholders and setting the stage for future large-scale impacts, have not necessarily produced tangible or highly visible impacts as of yet.
 We first engaged practitioners through a successful workshop on the &amp;quot;magic of creativity and coworking hubs&amp;quot; in November 2016 with about 15 participants from commercial and civil sector-driven coworking spaces in London. This workshop introduced key findings from organisational collective creativity research (the literature we have reviewed during our study) and engaged participants in a focused discussion on the various dimensions of interpersonal creativity around coworking spaces (that emerges during conversations of different types) as well as supporting factors. This workshop moreover gave our research team a clearer understanding of how practitioners view the dynamics of &amp;quot;creative clashes&amp;quot; (that are central to their branding and identities) within their organisations and confirmed that coworking space founders and hosts care very much indeed about creativity even if they do not have the resources or time to track it in any systematic way. We will run another workshop - this time on the future of coworking - on 27 March 2017 to continue to engage practitioners and build a network through which we can subsequently hope to disseminate our key empirical findings (which will be available from late 2017 onwards and published a year or two later). We will then organise a final conference with both academics and practitioners, (ideally) together with a collaborating external organisation. All of these efforts have immediate impacts while strategically building the preconditions for broader long-term once our empirical findings become available. A key long-term objective is to make a contribution to the shaping of coworking in the late 2010s and the early 2020s by creating knowledge that can inform the facilitation of collective creativity within diverse collaborative communities and amid a growing need for sustainability-oriented work spaces and new enterprises.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F7F882D5-9974-4B6D-8914-AB15CDC046E4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca6f12f02a82.33037695</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N007301/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2F0BA056-5E00-4769-9080-8085A23EC6F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Entrepreneurship</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE390962-5CA1-4D76-A6D5-A303DED717E8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Knowledge Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7A58901-77B0-4F9E-8784-604D48D233C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sustainability Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
