Such faith in the authority of a historian who had written over two thousand years earlier (and who had of course never offered any such argument, since Athens had no paper money) may seem to be a symptom of the hold of classicism over the educated elite of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. However, even as the idea of 'history as the teacher of life' began to lose ground over the course of the century, as the modern world became ever more conscious of a vast gap separating its experiences from the world of classical antiquity, Thucydides retained his importance. Rather than a guide to action, his work became a model of critical analysis. His diagnosis of the workings of politics, already an important influence on Hobbes (who had translated the work) continued to influence political and social analysis, liberals and conservatives alike finding there insights and understanding sympathetic to their own perspectives. He displaced Tacitus as the model historian, not least because he offered a detailed methodological justification of his work that chimed with the expectations of the new 'scientific' historiography; Leopold von Ranke, for example, wrote his doctoral dissertation (sadly lost) on Thucydides, and the influence on the imperative to show 'wie es eigentlich gewesen' - even if it is not, as it has been argued, a direct citation - is undeniable. For Nietzsche, Thucydides was the epitome of 'realism' in philosophy, a perfect counterpart to Plato and Platonism.\n\nEven today, Thucydides is regularly cited, as the founder of critical history, as a pioneering analyst of democracy and its limitations, and above all in the field of international relations and war studies. The Melian dialogue is the 'locus classicus' of what has been labelled as the 'classical realist' school of international relations, with Thucydides seen as a key influence on figures like Leo Strauss, Kenneth Waltz, Robert Gilpin and Henry Kissinger; 'Thucydides on War' remains a regular course in the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nRemarkably, the history of the reception of Thucydides since antiquity has never been studied in depth; neither the history of scholarship and the publication of editions, translations and commentaries, nor his far-reaching influence in historiography, political science, philosophy and international relations. Detailed studies within the field of Classics, looking at the narrative and rhetorical structures of Thucydides' work, its relation to contemporary science and its place in the development of classical historiography, are entirely unknown to those working on relevant material in other disciplines; conversely, debates on the place of the History in the development of international relations and political theory are largely unknown to classicists, while the highly politicised Thucydides of the American neo-conservatives seems to float free of any historical context. The aim of these workshops is to bring together scholars from different disciplinary traditions to discuss how Thucydides has been read, studied and reinterpretated over the centuries, and how his work has influenced the development of different attempts at understanding the modern world.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11720</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>512800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Thucydides: reception, reinterpretation and influence</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/H001204/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>70565962-7FED-413C-9E7F-829A8D40C20A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ec9c4aa5ec9c4be</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The most striking outcome of the three research workshops as a whole is a new sense of the prevalence, if not ubiquity, of references to Thucydides in historical, social and political debates in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has long been remarked that it would be a challenge to find a writer in this period who did not engage to some extent with classical antiquity; in the course of the workshops, it began to seem as if the same might be said for the specific instance of Thucydides and his History. The second major finding was the variety of readings and interpretations of the work, and the varied and contradictory ideas of its author. We began to explore the question of whether this implied that Thucydides was in essence a blank space into which almost any set of ideas and assumptions could be projected, or whether the variability of interpretation could be attributed to different national traditions, different disciplinary approaches or different levels of engagement with the text as a whole rather than a limited number of 'set piece' passages determined by the school or university curriculum. A third theme, which again needs to be explored at greater length, was the different ways in which Thucydides could be used; sometimes as the foundation of an argument, sometimes as a key authority or crucial source of evidence, sometimes as a mere rhetorical adornment. Overall, it is clear that Thucydides' influence was widespread, to be identified in the development of historiography, political and social theory and international relations / but never simple.



This has important implications for the study both of the modern reception of classical antiquity and of the development of social, political and international relations theory; it also emphasises the need for these disciplines to establish a dialogue and to explore one another's methodological approaches ('reception' versus 'history of ideas'). The workshops have identified a significant number of questions for future research, and it is clear that the planned four-year research project will be insufficient to cover the whole subject but will have to narrow its focus; we hope, therefore, that the workshops will stimulate research beyond the activities planned by the PI and others involved in the organisation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A number of the papers from the International Perspectives session engaged directly with current foreign policy debates and the continuing evocation of Thucydides in them, and so we hope that publication of the papers and future research may lead to further debate outside the academic sphere.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>81CD2967-03CD-4D4C-B65C-92E626384C83</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2894713378.413313477926dde</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government/ Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E71623DC-1113-4544-B5D1-EC3A56833C0D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thucydides and the Modern World - Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8cf2c55e385373007977fc69e02b3a6d"><gtr:id>8cf2c55e385373007977fc69e02b3a6d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morley N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-107-01920-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>542eac536ffe64.05875902</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>58628B6C-592A-4ED5-BE95-9150541B7236</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7e502a96c61ca7ecbb21fccd73fbb7f2"><gtr:id>7e502a96c61ca7ecbb21fccd73fbb7f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harloe, Katherine; Morley, Neville</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-107-01920-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_98749332783c0528aa</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E006116/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>89068F3B-44C7-45D9-92CB-8BE148301439</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Reception</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
