Several years ago we found that the reproduction in fish living in many UK rivers had been damaged by exposure to chemicals contained in the WwTW effluents that disrupt the body's sex hormone systems. The chemicals identified were oestrogens (female sex hormone) and included natural oestrogen hormones, pharmaceutical oestrogens taken by women as part of the contraceptive pill, and some industrial chemicals that mimic oestrogens because they are similar in structure. Feminised fish in the wild is of concern because we have shown that they have a reduced capacity to breed and this may lead to adverse effects for the population. Disorders in male human reproductive health occur that are very similar in nature to effects seen in wild fish and some of these effects have been associated with exposure to EDCs. Studies in the laboratory with fish have shown that it is possible to induce some of the feminised responses occurring in wild populations with the environmental oestrogens identified. Recently however, we have found that effluents throughout the UK contain anti-androgenic activity in addition to oestrogenic activity / anti-androgenic activity would suppress the normal male sex hormone system (androgens) and thus also feminise males. For some effluents the potency of the anti-androgenic activity was very high and there is an urgency to identify the chemicals of concern, not least because they may have adverse effects for humans too. In this proposal we intend to first identify the chemical structures responsible for the anti-androgenic contamination of UK WwTW effluents. This will be done by fractionating the test effluents and screening the fractions with a cell based assay that can detect anti-androgen activity. The chemicals with anti-androgen activity are ultimately identified using high resolution analytical chemistry techniques. This approach will also be undertaken using bile (a fluid found in a small sac as part of the liver) from fish exposed to WwTW effluent to find out which of the anti-androgens found in the effluents enter the fish and build up in their bodies. Many chemicals taken into the body undergo change (metabolism) and our team (EMH) has considerable expertise in recognising chemical structures derived from other chemicals taken in from the environment. We will then test how potent the anti-androgens identified are in fish by first measuring their ability to inhibit production of an androgen (male sex hormone) dependent protein called spiggin in the stickleback. In the final part of this work we will take the most potent anti-androgen found and expose roach (a fish in which disruption of sex in wild populations in UK rivers is well documented) from embryos and up to 1 year in age and measure a range of endpoints to assess how the chemical effects the development of sex (whether it becomes a male or female fish) and effects on the machinery required to produce eggs (females) and sperm (in males). This work will provide a more informed knowledge of the health impacts of EDCs for the better protection of our aquatic resources and biodiversity. Identification of anti-androgenic compounds in wastewaters, will also likely allow their sources to be identified and facilitate an assessment of exposure and risk to human health. The work will contribute to environmental impact assessments and have importance in the regulation of discharges and thus is of very wide interest to the government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, industry and the wider public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>281927</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SCIDIP-ES - Scientific Data Infrastructure for Preservation - Earth Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration/partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>4AE5A1A0-F0E4-4604-98F4-0506C56DD1D9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9dc41aab9dc41be-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Collaborations with UK Environment Agency, defra, Brunel University, Sussex University, Anglian Water plc, South west water plc., National Institute of Basic Biology and Min of Environment ?

Objectives: To overall determine the significance of anti-androgens (AAs) in UK effluents in disruption of sexual function in wild fish, with three specific aims: 1.) To identify the chemical structures responsible for the anti-androgenic contamination of UK WwTW effluents, 2.) To determine the relative potency of the anti- androgens identified in fish using a biomarker response (spiggin) in the stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), 3.)To determine the ability of the most potent anti-androgen identified to induce disruption of sexual development in roach (Rutilus rutilus).

Identification of AAs in WwTW effluents: We used bioassay -directed fractionation techniques to profile the anti-androgen activity in WwTW effluents. Analysis of extracts of effluents from WwTWs with primarily domestic or hospital influent inputs revealed complex profiles of anti-androgen activity comprising 21 - 53 HPLC fractions (Hill et al, 2010, Environ Sci. and Technol. 44: 1137-1143). Structures of bioavailable AAs were identified by exposing juvenile rainbow trout to WwTW effluents and profiling the bile for androgen receptor activity using yeast (anti-YAS) and mammalian-based androgen receptor transcription (AR-CALUX) screens. The predominant fractions with AA activity in both androgen receptor screens contained the germicides chlorophene and triclosan, and together these contaminants accounted for 48% of the total anti-YAS activity in the fish bile. Other AA compounds identified in bile included chloroxylenol, dichlorophene, resin acids, hydroxypyrene, napthols, oxybenzone, nonylphenol, and bisphenol A. Pure standards of these compounds were active in the androgen receptor screens at potencies relative to flutamide of between 0.1 and 13.0. Thus, we have identified a diverse range of AA chemicals in WwTWs that are bioavailable to fish (Rostkowski et al, 2011, Environ Sci. and Technol. 45: 10660-10667).

 Comparing the potencies of both chemicals identified in the effluents and bile of fish (and a further set of 20 chemicals with known/suspected anti-androgenic activity and of human/environmental health concern) in the AR CALUX/YAS in vitro screening systems has shown that responses can vary across the two cell systems for different chemicals. These findings have raised questions regarding as to whether chemicals that have AA activity in the human androgen receptor systems are representative of receptor interactions in fish. We are collaborating with colleagues in Japan who have developed reporter assay with fish androgen receptors to address this critical question, with a future research paper on the issue anticipated. 

Determine the relative potency of the anti- androgens identified in fish using a biomarker response (spiggin) in the stickleback. We conducted in vivo exposures (21 days) to sticklebacks of a selection of the more potent AA chemicals identified in the bile of fish exposed to WwTW effluents and measured responses using an established bioassay for anti-androgens (spiggin induction). No effect was detected for test AAs when tested individually, or as mixtures. It was likely therefore that AAs themselves do not cause feminisation of the stickleback.

Determine the ability of the most potent anti-androgen identified to induce disruption of sexual development in roach. We successfully undertook two long term exposures of roach (6 to185 days post hatch) via the water to selected AAs and to a mixture of these AAs (including in combination with an oestrogen). Our findings to date provide no evidence for any feminising effect of any of the AAs (including for flutamide) at environmentally relevant exposures. We have however shown that a mixture of ethinyloestradiol (for a sub threshold feminising effect level when dosed individually) in combination with the two anti-androgens at the same exposure levels for which they show no effects separately, induced a marked feminised effect (an ovarian cavity) in males. Hence, our studies have revealed that a combined mixture of anti-androgens and an estrogen at environmentally relevant levels have caused 100% feminisation of the male fish.

This adds further to the hypothesis that the feminised effects in wild fish in UK rivers are likely the effect of exposure to oestrogens and anti-androgens in combination. In some of further work associated directly with this project, we have shown that exposure of fish (stickleback and roach) to fenitrothion (a pesticide) induces anti-androgenic responses, including disruption of sexual behaviours (Sebire et al., 2009; Southam et al., 2011).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have identified a new suite of anti-androgenic chemicals that accumulate in fish exposed to WWTW



Work with the Environment Agency, Astrazeneca and WRc, and Brunel and Reading University, has established

 the widespread nature of ant-androgens in wastewater treatment works effluents (and indicated that they 

contribute to sexual disruption in wild fish living in English Rivers).



The collective research funded under this project has had significant public dissemination and wide stakeholder engagement throughout, notably with the water industry, DEFRA, The UK Environment Agency, US EPA, and the pharmaceutical industry (e.g. Astrazeneca).



Editorial features on this work have been run in Environmental health news - 9 June 2009 http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/newscience/horse-estrogens-from-hrt-active-in-fish/ and Featured in ES&amp;amp;T Chemical and Engineering News. 



We have worked closely with end users to inform them on the results obtained (notably UK water Cos, 

pharmaceuticals industry and government regulators - DEFRA, EA etc.). Exeter has supported research in the 

so call Endocrine Disruption Demonstration Programme ( a &amp;pound;40M programme) including the UK Water Industry,

 the Environment Agency and DEFRA to investigate which treatment technologies are the more effective at 

removing EDCs in WWTW before the discharge of effluents into UK Rivers. This progamme has made significant 

steps in understanding the effectiveness of advanced treatment methods, including GAC, ozonation and chlorine dioxide in 

the removal of EDCs. 

.

We have effectively implemented a range of molecular tools, spanning targeted qRT-PCR, gene arrays and 

DNA microsatellites into various laboratories, including an industry laboratory, and these tools are being used

 to address the mechanisms by which EDCs work and investigate their population level consequences.

It has also appeared in NERC News, as NERC podcast, as an ACS webinar, as short videos on U-tube (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/universityofexeter#p/c/868210A42F3C27E1/6/rbD-8xnbezA) , featured on BBC televisions including Country File and features in various international news and televisions programmes.


 Further associated work:

This research project has resulted in a series of additional 5 full collaborative research papers on EDCs, principally oestrogens, between the partners, all in top ranking environmental journals. In this work, new classes of EDCs have been identified (e.g. equine oestrogens used in pharmaceuticals), and the detailed biological effects analyses of the pharmaceutical, diclofenac that is taken up from WwTW effluent into fish has been established. This project has led to further significant research funding to investigate the wider health implications of exposure to AAs. Some of this funding (DEFRA/Japan) is focused on the development of in vitro reporter assay for high throughout screening of chemicals with (anti) androgenic activity. Other work (NERC funded) will establish transgenic fish that will allow for a systems-wide effects analysis on where AAs interact in the body for a more intelligent approach for understanding possible processes affected. The newly funded project will also undertake deep sequencing to establish effect pathways and altered processes for some of the AAs identified in this project.
