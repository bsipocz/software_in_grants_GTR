They were written in Latin and/or in Old English, were preserved in medieval episcopal and monastic archives and the majority survive in late copies, rather than on original sheets of parchment. Many have been forged or corrupted in the course of their transmission, but scholars have largely been dependent upon inadequate editions of the nineteenth century. If their texts can be property established and understood, these charters provide crucial (indeed often the only) evidence for early medieval English political, religious, social and economic history, for the early development of the English language and its local dialects, for the fortunes of Latin (earning and culture, as well as for the life of particular religious institutions. 
The proposed research therefore seeks to establish authoritative texts of the charters by full study of the manuscript evidence and to distinguish the genuine from the spurious or the corrupt. It proceeds by examining the script(s), the formulation and the historical context of every charter. It also seeks to establish the precise topography and landscape of the estates through identification of their bounds, and to set out the history both of the archives where the charters were presented and of the religious house(s) involved. 

This proposal is directed towards the charters of leading southern and western churches, which had not been assigned to any editors, or which needed to be reassigned under the joint BA/RHS project to edit the entire corpus. Under the proposal there will be completed and submitted to the BA/RHS committee for their expert comment editions of the charters of: a) Glastonbury, the house where the Benedictine reform of the tenth century first took root but which has preserved West Saxon royal diplomas of 7th9th centuries but muddied the waters with a huge accretion of myth, 
b) Chertsey, the leading early monastery in Surrey, 
c) a gathering of eleven 'Southern Archives', which have each prepared too few charters to merit whole volumes to themselves (many have only one charter), and 
d) of Evesham Abbey, a house with a notorious record of twelfth and thirteenth century forgery. Even more important the proposal intends to give a decisive push to the two large archives remaining unedited, namely the cathedral priories of Winchester and Worcester The leading palaeographer, philologist and place name scholar, Dr A Rumble, is bringing his edition of the 'Charters of the Old Minster, Winchester to completion during the period of this proposal and Dr Kelly will lend her expertise in historical and diplomatic analysis to strengthen that major work. Even more important, however, is the proposal for the 'Charters of Worcester'. 
Worcester, substantially the largest archive in the entire corpus, has hitherto proved to be too great an undertaking for a single scholar, even one of the most skilled. An edition to the scholarly standards now established for the BA/RHS series threatened to prove more than a life's work and cannot easily be reconciled with the pressures of today's academic life. The proposal is therefore for Dr Kelly to prepare preliminary texts of the Worcester charters, with notes on the diplomatic of the early charters (7th9th centuries in particular), thus to provide a foundation on which two of the ablest young scholars in the field, who have already published outstanding work on Worcester, can take up the task. 
There are huge advantages to having the edition of the Worcester charters undertaken collaboratively and in editing the Evesham charters at much the same time, since they are closely interrelated. The authenticity of individual texts is often dependent upon a proper understanding of documents from the other archive.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>366679</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D502683/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
