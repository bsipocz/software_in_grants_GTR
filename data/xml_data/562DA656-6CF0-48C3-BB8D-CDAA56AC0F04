We will then collect feedback from the participants in these organisations to see what benefit they got from it, and whether it affected their sense of resilience and well-being. We'll write up our findings in an AHRC report, and also present them in a seminar to other academics interested in taking philosophy beyond academia and into other areas of adult education. 

If this pilot project is a success, we will then seek further funding for Stage 2 (not covered by this grant), which would establish a social enterprise to sell courses in practical philosophy to private-sector organisations, while also providing them at a subsidized rate for more disadvantaged groups such as mental health charities. 

The project follows on from an AHRC-funded research project in 2012, called 'Philosophical Communities', which researched the history and contemporary rise of grassroots philosophy clubs around the world. That report noted the remarkable growth of grassroots philosophy clubs, with over 1000 such clubs listed on meetup.com, and the number of people signed up to such clubs growing at an annual rate of 30%. The report generated a lot of media interest, with articles on grassroots philosophy appearing in the Financial Times, the New York Times, La Reppublica, El Confidencial and Dong-a llbo in South Korea.

This project will take that research into new territory, taking it from the theoretical to the practical. What impact does practical philosophy have on people outside of academia? What benefits do they feel they get from it? Is it commercially viable to sell such courses to companies, as a means not just for improving employee resilience, but also for enhancing character? Can practical philosophy courses enhance the ethical culture of organisations? And does philosophy only appeal to middle-class university graduates, or is it also accessible and useful to more disadvantaged groups?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project would have the following outcomes: 

1) Create and test-out an eight-week practical philosophy course with three different partners. 
2) Prepare supplementary materials which can be used in future courses. 
3) Collect feedback in the form of qualitative and quantitative forms (the quantitative forms would measure basic well-being factors such as levels of stress, happiness and self-determination, as well as satisfaction with the course). 
4) Prepare report for AHRC and present findings to researchers and practitioners at a London event. 
5) Consider whether to proceed with Stage 2 by launching a social enterprise for the commercial sale of the course to private-sector, public sector and third sector organisations. Consider also the possible avenues for funding of Stage 2 (including RSA Catalyst funding and potentially a larger AHRC follow-on grant). 
6) More broadly, the project would widen interest in philosophy, and create advocates for philosophy in various different industries and sectors. It would also join up academic philosophy to other sectors, particularly to charities and public-sector organisations. 

The project would benefit the following groups: 

- The primary beneficiaries would be the participants in the courses, who would get the benefit of learning practical techniques for resilience, while also having a space to discuss and explore what flourishing means for them. The course would hopefully enhance their health, well-being, and flourishing. The feedback from the one-off workshops Jules Evans has done has been very positive (see a feedback form from Epsom Library, in the attachments, as an example) and we anticipate a similarly positive response to a longer and more structured course. 
- The project would create an evidence base for the course's effectiveness, by taking quantitative and qualitative feedback from the course participants, in the form of well-being questionnaires and brief interviews. 
- The project would also serve as a pilot for the possible expansion of the course through the creation of a social enterprise. This would greatly increase the impact of the course. 
- We hope the course will prove useful to other organisations similar to our three partners - to prisons, mental health charities, NHS well-being centres, schools, universities and further education colleges. 
-Already, some British schools have informally and independently run philosophy work-shops based on some of our material, and reported back excellent results (see the attachments for a letter from one-teacher). 
- We also hope the course will prove popular with private-sector organisations, by highlighting the link between stress management and ethics, or between resilience and character. 
- The course is already of interest to policy-makers interested in teaching well-being in schools and adult education, including Anthony Seldon, headmaster of Wellington College; James O'Shaughnessy, former head of the Number 10 Policy Unit; and Lord Richard Layard, one of the developers of Improving Access for Psychological Therapies in the NHS; all of whom have spoken of their interest in practical philosophy courses that teach virtue ethics and connect it to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (see attachments for their comments). It fits well the growing 'politics of well-being' movement. 
- The course is likely to attract international interest, with our book and blog-posts on practical philosophy already informally inspiring courses in schools and universities in Brazil, Lebanon, Holland, Poland, the US and South Korea (see attachment for emails from some of these). 
- More broadly, we hope the course will help people flourish, while promoting a 'thinking culture' in the public. And we hope it will connect academic philosophy to non-academic audiences, revitalizing public interest in philosophy and creating advocates for philosophy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24171</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The success of the pilot programme has persuaded several companies to launch practical philosophy workshops and courses for their staff, including Allianz, Deloitte and Escape the City school. 

In addition, professional sports teams have shown an interest in following Saracens' example - Arsenal football club has expressed interest in running similar workshops. 

Finally, several schools have used our teaching materials in order to teach classes in practical philosophy, and some have got in touch to hire Philosophies for Life to run workshops at their schools. 

We intend to continue the commercial development of our approach and teaching materials, and to expand the development of our approach within the mental healthcare and prison sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9229D0DF-8E1A-4395-ACE5-FCD2C653096A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463434a1cfdc9.65495778</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We developed an eight-part course in practical philosophy, and tried it out in three different organizations - at HMP Low Moss, at Saracens rugby club, and at Manor Gardens mental health charity. 

We wanted to know if these different groups found practical philosophy useful and therapeutic. 

The course explored well-being techniques from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, mindfulness CBT and other psychotherapies, and connected these techniques to their original philosophical contexts in ancient philosophies like Stoicism and Buddhism. 

We wanted to know if there was commercial potential for the provision of such courses in companies, in mental healthcare, in prisons, and in other areas. 

We evaluated the course using well-being questionnaires and qualitative interviews before and after the course. 

The pilot proved to be very popular in all three partner organizations, with participants saying the course had enhanced their sense of their ability to cope with adversity. 

Since the end of the pilot, several companies have approached us to run practical philosophy workshops and courses, including Deloitte, Allianz, and Escape the City school.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We need to scale up our approach, either by developing an online version of the course, or by training other people in how to run courses. 

We also need to strengthen the evidence base and build partnerships in order to introduce the course further into community mental healthcare and prisons. 

We need help in developing our business plan, in growing the business, and in balancing commercial and social objectives. 

We also think the practical philosophy approach has a lot of potential in schools and universities - we need help in developing this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BE87DF38-E1E4-468A-BC23-EDBB27D9FDE7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54633a60196d03.54850058</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmace</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.scribd.com/doc/229504007/Philosophies-for-Life-Final-Report</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L013835/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
