Rescon, a UK human performance company, has teamed up with Going For Independence, a UK social enterprise focused on empowering individuals to become independent, to deliver One Precious Life. 
The team are going to actively recruit two individuals with a human performance background and pair them with two individuals from a social care or health background. They are going to house these four coaches together for three months where they will learn about how to apply the principles of high performance athlete training and service to those with Long Term Conditions. They will learn off each other, as well as from the expertise of Rescon and Going For Independence. They will also develop a new competition, designed to be inclusive, fun, active and a great spectator sport, based off the principles of popular sports and paralympic inclusivity. Evaluation and monitoring technologies will be developed, as elite athletes would use, but specifically tailored to those with long term conditions, as appropriate.
After the development and training phase the coaches, and their support team, will go into hospitals, and recruit particpants in the program who have both the motivation to be involved and long term conditions. These individuals will be followed up in their own homes where they will be trained up with no attention to detail spared. They will be trained and educated in activity, nutrition, form, function, recovery, managing their conditions, social life, sexual health, and how to access all the information they may need to optimse their day to day performance. A specific target in this program is the participation of all &amp;quot;athletes&amp;quot; in the end of program tournament. Our athletes will compete in an arena in this first of its kind competition where success is not just judged on points scored. Equally weighted to points are team work, being sporting and style. 
By the end of the program we will have taken 28 individuals, with long term conditions, and given them new hope, an improved body, mind and spirit whilst giving the four coaches a new career in high performance delivery to those who most need it. The pilot of One Precious Life, will build up the resource, knowledge and evidence for delivering this approach to the UK population at scale. One Previous Life will not only save a generation that are chained by a system that does not address individuals with Long Term Conditions as valuable, it will also increase employment and booster new industry and the UK economy. One Precious Life is part of the Long Term Care Revolution. Together with the other pilots that are part of the Long Term Care Revolution we will transform the face of the Health and Social Care industry in the UK, providing a better present and future for us all.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>425784</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971382</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
