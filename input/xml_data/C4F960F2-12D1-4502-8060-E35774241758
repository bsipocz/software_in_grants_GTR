It was recognised that the changing landscape of performance management arising from the new Coalition Government required a local solution that would demonstrate the outcomes of cultural services to the people of Derbyshire, and the project was therefore planned with the applicant. \n \nHaving identified the need both for evidence and an evaluation framework, the research will review existing frameworks, and devise and test a new version. In planning the project, it was felt that a framework for Derbyshire should be able to demonstrate the intrinsic value of culture, whilst capturing its contribution to wider social and political agenda. As well as the local focus, it was also felt that the research should be conducted in such a way as to be consistent with - and transferable to - national practice, in order to facilitate benchmarking. \n \nThe central research question is: What is the intrinsic value of cultural services? The three sub-questions derived from this are: \n- How should 'impact' be defined in the context of cultural services? \n- Is it possible to define the value of cultural services, in a way which moves beyond the analysis of anecdotal evidence? \n- How can we select and adapt both qualitative and quantitative indicators and measures of impact which meet the needs of all stakeholders? \n \nThe proposed project aims: \n- To analyse historical and current attempts to evaluate the impact of cultural services, from which to: \n- To develop a model for evaluating the impact of cultural services, comprising both indicators and measures, which is then transferable to all cultural service providers within the public sector. \n\nThe specific objectives of the research are: \n- To collate and analyse quantitative and qualitative data pertaining to the impact of cultural services \n- To identify and fill gaps in the existing evidence base via empirical research \n- To develop and test indicators and measures for evaluating the impact of cultural services and, in doing so: \n- To develop an evaluation framework which is scalable and transferable to cultural services provider organisations of all types. \n \nThe proposed research design is such that the phases in combination enable the development and refinement of an evaluation framework whose effectiveness will have been tested and discussed according to a range of criteria including sufficiency, generalisability, feasability and validity. \n \nTo summarise, the expected outcomes of this research include: \n- Qualitative and quantitative evidence of the impact of cultural services within one local authority (Derbyshire County Council) \n- A review of the effectiveness of existing evaluation frameworks for cultural services \n- The development of a rigorously tested framework of indicators and measures for the evaluation of cultural services, transferable to other local authorities within the UK. \n- The creation of a compelling case for continued investment in cultural services \n- A strengthened rationale for partnership which goes beyond the need merely to achieve efficiency, so that a wide variety of potential partners understand the benefits of engaging with cultural services. \n- The development of research previously conducted by Sheffield Information School in impact evaluation, and an important contribution to the field. \n \nIn terms of the potential applications and benefits of the research, as stated in the aims above the evaluation framework will be both scalable and transferable to cultural service provider organisations of all types. This is particularly timely, as in the current financial climate all cultural services - if they are to continue - need to demonstrate their value both to service providers and service users.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cultural services are central to Derbyshire's identity. Local authority partners have greatly invested in quality services such as libraries and sports, but there are some elements of cultural provision which are unique: in particular we would highlight the Peak District, Britain's first and still most-visited national park, the Derwent Valley Mills, cradle of the industrial revolution and the only World Heritage Site in the East Midlands, five of the UK's most notable historic homes, and a strong tradition of taking arts and literature events into very local communities. The county also faces challenges - rural isolation in the west, low pay, low skills in the east, a lack of major venues, competition from surrounding major cities. Since local government reorganisation in 1995, the county and city have pursued individual strategies; now, prompted by the existence of the DCMS 'City of Culture' programme there is a new and energetic engagement at strategic level which it is hoped will develop into a strong shared vision and a distinctive cultural offer which attracts local people and visitors alike.\n\nThe proposed research will therefore provide valuable evidence for decision makers who are faced with increasingly complex and difficult decisions about priorities. Cultural Services can struggle to demonstrate outcomes and impact when compared with so-called 'life and death' services. This project will attempt to identify how cultural services contribute to wellbeing, quality of life, healthy and sustainable communities, and will explore the benefits to individuals of participating in cultural activities.\n\nThe methodology developed will be transferable and will be of value to other, similar partnerships where a number of players collaborate across a wide range of disciplines and a broad geographical area.\n\nVoluntary and community sector organisations will gain valuable experience of evaluation and advocacy, and individual participants will have a real opportunity to make their voices heard.\n\nVia this research the partners hope to understand those factors which influence people's choices; how cultural provision impacts on quality of life, health and wellbeing, and achievement, and how Derbyshire's distinctive cultural scene contributes to tourism and economic development. \n\nThe principal beneficiaries will therefore be Derbyshire County Council and Derby City Council, the eight district of Amber Valley, Bolsover, Chesterfield, Derbyshire Dales, Erewash, High Peak, North East Derbyshire and South Derbyshire, the Peak District National Park Authority. Anticipated beneficiaries from wider sectoral partnerships include: Sport England, Arts Council England, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (or its successor body), the Derbyshire Arts Partnership, the Derbyshire Cultural Officers Group, and the Destination Management Partnership, among others.\n\nAll of these will benefit from a greater understanding of how partnership working improves outcomes, what motivates participation, what benefits individuals derive from their participation, and what interventions are most likely to be successful. The outcomes of the study will inform future investment decisions and provide evidence for advocacy. The methodology which results will be used by the cultural partnership and by individual providers and groups of providers in Derbyshire and will be disseminated widely throughout the cultural sector regionally and nationally.\n\nAcademic Beneficiaries are described in the above section, but it is worth noting that the Information School at Sheffield University will also benefit both from the contribution to this critical - yet under-researched - area of cultural services evaluation, and from the development of a transferable methodology and resulting evaluation framework.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54916</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024739/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
