Things</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L023601/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Internet of Soft Things project asks how a radically connected world can be designed to benefit human wellbeing, and in particular, what types of experience will be enabled by smart textile interfaces as an important part of this vision of the future. 

One in four of us is likely to experience mental health problems at some time in our lives, and wellbeing has come to be seen as a 'grand challenge', crucial to the future of our cities and even our security. In the UK, the coalition government committed to measuring national wellbeing through an Office for National Statistics programme, and anxiety is understood to be more than a 'mere curiosity'. However, social stigma often leads individuals to hide difficulties instead of seeking help: in the past, the vast majority of clients using the mental health charity MIND would have been through psychiatric services and still be taking medication. Today the charity finds that this is changing, with increasing numbers of people walking in off the street. Managing the anxiety and distress of individuals so that they are at lower risk of becoming disturbed or dysfunctional (and therefore prescribed medication) has become an important part of MIND's work. While in the past evidencing the cost benefits of non-medicalised approaches to mental wellbeing has been difficult, research undertaken in Western Finland presents compelling figures for talking therapies (for example, presenting cases of schizophrenia are claimed to have been reduced by 90% over the last 25 years). 

The project will draw on this and other relational approaches in psychotherapy and counselling. The Internet of Soft Things project will add to the debate in the design community about how we name the beneficiaries of design ('user', 'human', 'person'?) and champion the move from an individual to a collaborative, social model of meaning making. This new Person-Centred Approach to Design is important because it will enable us to move beyond the current deficit model and narrow focus on what people lack or need, to look at the positive things and meanings people bring to situations and communities. Design will be able to engage more meaningfully with calls for wellbeing through a better understanding of people's potential for growth and capacity for meaning making and a new ability to design for people's ongoing creativity and empowerment. There are parallels between the scale of mental health issues and a purely technological vision of the Internet of Things (IoT); that is, that it occurs everywhere, but is often concealed. If the statistic of one in four people experiencing mental health problems is powerful, it becomes even more pervasive if we consider the mental wellbeing as a continuum upon which every one of us sits (and moves).

This project will build on recent research in smart embroidered interfaces to explore the potential benefits of an Internet of Soft Things for mental health and wellbeing. It will draw on recent research in wearable technology, which has challenged many of the initial assumptions of 'ubiquitous' computing, namely, that it should be concealed, and that we should not be aware when we are acting through it. These assumptions have led to a belief that no new things or forms need be developed, as technology would merely be hidden within the objects already familiar to us. In fact, what the last two decades of wearable research have shown is that an expressive use of technologies works better with the way we manage our social identities through things. There is therefore scope to explore a range of existing and new experimental forms for personal networked design concepts while addressing the pressing need for more robust and reliable textile interfaces.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research focuses on building new knowledge and practice in designing for wellbeing and mental health service providers in an Internet of Soft Things. Through a built-in process of reflection, this knowledge will be captured and made available to future interdisciplinary teams of designers, scientists and user communities working in the wild. The project's impact aims are to:

o Train staff in non-medicalised mental healthcare to work with smart textiles as part of workshops with service users
o A practical toolkit will be co-developed as part of the project comprising basic materials, tools and instructions for building personal textile interfaces
o An accompanying booklet will gather the learning of the participating Notts Mind Network staff and present case studies and guidelines for running workshops with service users along a number of themes (such as significant sounds and narratives, managing privacy in networks, and confidence through skills development)

o Inform staff in non-medicalised mental healthcare about the issues and opportunities for their clients in a networked society
o Through reflections and dialogue across the team, sector specific knowledge will be shared and possible implications teased out
o These will be brought together in a presentation format and disseminated to the national UK Mind Network, Open Dialogue groups in the UK and overseas, and members of The Consortium of Therapeutic Communities

o Support third sector provision of wellbeing and mental healthcare provision
o This sector is fragmented and reliant on charity and project funding; we will bring together a range of groups to identify future research in the Internet of Things to create a meta-level network of networks so that they may support each other and share resources
o We will provide a number of demonstration days and discussion events to facilitate future research in this area

o Inform wider policy change with regards wellbeing and mental healthcare provision in the UK
o Nottingham Healthcare Trust has shown interest in the evidence emerging from the Open Dialogue model of treatment, in which networks of family and significant others are closely involved
o This project will benefit from senior representatives from the NHS sitting on the board, and will contribute to ways of working towards wellbeing that do not begin with a deficit model of the individual

Our demonstration days will form part of Nottingham Mental Health Awareness Weeks, the annual ITAG Conference held annually in October in project active years at NTU; work in progress will be exhibited and presented at the Arcintex symposium being hosted by Nottingham Trent University in February 2015, and final demonstrators shown at Arcintex Feb 2016.

To maximize the desired level of impact we have brought together an advisory board of experts from the relevant professional communities in mobile and cloud computing, mental health and wellbeing, and smart textile research, including senior managers from the National Health Service in Nottinghamshire.

For the Nottinghamshire Mind Network, the outcome will be an actionable plan for providing the new Mind venue in the centre of Nottingham with a unique identity, designed around the findings and collaborative process of this project. This new venue will provide a space for increased public interaction through lower stigmatization of mental health issues, and will become a centre for future arts-led research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>294020</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A suite of three interviews with participants in the e-textiles workshops (Phase 1) of the Internet of Soft things project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>158C0163-CEE5-46A0-A45C-4643211E9F48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film is hosted on youtube and is publicly available.

The research team have introduced members at Bassetlaw Mind to the culture of academic design research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Crafts Council Make:Shift conference, Manchester</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0945A8D1-AF59-4CDD-9F78-72DDAEAA1D38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Internet of Soft Things project, specifically an account of the changing roles of the mental health service user participants, was one of three presentations in the Health and Wellbeing track at the Crafts Council's annual Make:Shift conference in Manchester.

The talk:

 discussed some of the challenges (and rewards) of doing design research with the mental health sector
 outlined what we mean by 'the Person-Centred Approach'
 reflected on how we are collecting and making sense of data
 and gave the audience an insight into what our participants and stakeholders have said they want from a networked mental health service</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5833597281d9a8.86710764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/news-events-seminars/sarah-kettley-the-person-centred-approach-a-non-deterministic-framework-for-ethical-participatory-design-resear</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>OU research team visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>68F0905C-7550-44B1-9081-9D3BBD55C93F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A research team from the Open university made contact with us and visited for a day sharing practice with e-textiles and vulnerable participants.

We were the only researchers to take a participant, challenging the current practices of participatory design research, and as a result, the conveners, from Leuven University, Belgium, have visited the team in Nottingham to meet the special needs advisory group at Oakfield School, take part in an e-textile workshop delivered by members of Bassetlaw Mind, and to discuss further work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5c7194aad24.01832557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://chimethodstories.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>first participant-delivered workshop, Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4DE1DEA8-336A-4B41-A71C-03BBA4042E76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of our workshop paper at CHI 2016, we welcomed an associate professor from Lueven University, Belgium to Nottingham Trent University; she became a participant in the first e-textile workshop delivered by members and volunteers from Bassetlaw Mind.

This is a huge impact outcome for the individual participants (mental health service users), who had taken part in the first phase of the project in early 2015. Neither had been in a university before, and had not been to Nottingham city in 20 years. They successfully delivered this workshop not only to the Belgian visitor, but also to a final year UG student, a local researcher in theatre practice, and the manager of another large third sector provider.

Outcomes from this include increased confidence for the participants to attend their first conference (see the entry for the Crafts Council), and plans to initiate a permanent advisory group (based on the Oakfield School model after a related visit to their NICER group).

We also shared the space with the textile design staff from NTU, who were doing some professional development, so there was crossover between the groups, including a presentation by the project RF, Tincuta Heinzel, to the staff team.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e74c531e50.66841670</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://aninternetofsoftthings.com/phase-2-textile-residency/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Kings Fund conference, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15A70F02-0F90-45BB-B292-7FC81A841803</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two of the team took a stall to the Increasing Access to Mental Health Care Kings Fund conference in October 2015. e-textile objects and the films made by Salamanda Tandem with service user participants were shared, and attendees could engage with both finished e-textile objects, and the materials and components service users had used to make their own.

reach
International: regular dissemination through the Arcintex international research network; the research team hosted the Arcintex network workshops and symposium at NTU, Feb 2015 (78 delegates from 7 countries); international academic dissemination through papers and conference activity
Across disciplines: using novel methods for practitioner, participant and researcher reflection on the heuristic impact of working according to a Person-Centred Approach; charting changes in mindsets and methodological expectations in textile design and user-centred interaction design and HCI communities (evidenced in reflective narratives throughout and at close of the research period, and captured in academic outputs)

significance
Testing and presenting foundational methodological developments: testing the psychotherapeutic Person-Centred Approach as a methodology, and Interpersonal Process Recall as a method, for new sectors (e-Textile and wearable technology development, Interaction Design, Human-Computer Interaction, Participatory Design) (evidenced in reflective narratives throughout and at close of the research period, and captured in academic outputs)
Therapeutic impact for individual participants: 
The project has resulted in two types of impact that are hard to capture: 1) on the individual mental health service user, and 2) on academic and disciplinary practice. The first has been significant in terms of individuals' increased capacity for social interaction, confidence and wellbeing, as evidenced in qualitative research and reflections with stakeholders at Mind. The second has been manifested in the evolving mindsets of researchers on the project team, from 'expert based' to more open, 'person-centred' approaches to methods and subjects of research. This has been captured through reflexive activities throughout the project.participants at Mind reported increased levels of social confidence, lower levels of anxiety, increased verbalisation, increased confidence in skills, increased motor control, and lower levels of anger, evidenced through the use of a custom designed tool, the Starfish, based on the Recovery Star, and through the use of the WEMS scale; narrativised in the participant films made with Salamanda Tandem at the end of Phase 1 e-textile workshops, and through increased participant resilience and engagement in continuing impact activities
Changing practice and development of new services: e-textile workshops were developed as a stand-alone toolkit for third sector mental health service provision; training was developed and delivered to Mind volunteers and staff across the Nottinghamshire Mind Network; volunteers and staff delivered first autonomous workshops around Christmas 2016, and delivered a workshop to international researchers and managers of other regional wellbeing services in November 2016; Nottinghamshire Mind Network now has 50 e-textile kits for further service delivery. The barriers of this sector with regards Service Design as a more systemic approach were identified for the design research community.
Nottinghamshire Mind have also launched a new tiered membership, called Living Well; within this, the e-textile workshops are being used at 'level 1', in which new members require the most support.

Development of teaching and training material: the toolkit, training manual, and Starfish tool have been made publicly available on the project website through the Creative Commons license; PI authored core teaching book for UG textile courses on designing with 'smart' textiles (Bloomsbury Required Reading range, 2016); RF in Psychotherapy is teaching UG design students.

Recommendations for policy makers: have been drawn up and published on the project website; the PI and RF (R Kettley) have attended a number of national healthcare policy events (eg the UK Mental Health Taskforce's launch of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health) (2016-2017) to identify the most promising pathways to impact.

Further funding: the project supported our hypothesis that the design research community (including HCI, IoT development and physical computing) is unaware of different modalities (and therefore appropriate methodologies) when working with the mental health and wellbeing sector; a follow up literature review was supported by QR funding at NTU, which covered UK and European literature at the intersection of design and mental health. The findings from this have been presented at the annual NTU College research conference, and will be published in 2017. Further funding will be sought to include the grey literature, and other countries.
Two further projects have been supported by QR funding and strategic Seedcorn fundign at NTU: Electric Corset (and other future histories), and Expressive e-Broidery Interfaces for Wellbeing. Belectric Corset is concerned with the barriers fast fashion creates for wearables innovation, and develops novel design methods using historical fashion and textile archives as inspiration for modular systems of (smart, networked) dress. Expressive e-Broidery also deconstructs the design process to develop tools for the expressive integration of hardware within (smart, networked) textile design concepts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BAE27875-61B4-4884-8915-429E31D8AF84</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dc75fc1a6ca2.70001782</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>[WP1 - methodology development] we found that:

The Person-Centred Approach (the PCA) is very well suited as a design research methodology in a non-medical mental health service environment, but requires a high level of reflexive commitment from researchers. Thinking in reflexive/reflective ways, integral to the PCA, was less familiar within some disciplines and is potentially challenging for researchers.

Participants respond positively to the approach. Non-directivity in workshops, while challenging for some researchers, was welcomed by participants, who tended to settle quickly on what they wanted to do. With the support of a researcher on a 1:1 basis, participants co-created an object which had significant personal meaning as a result of being self-made. Participants also benefited therapeutically from an empathic, non-judgemental relationship with the researcher (reported in feedback as well as revealed in IPR). Participants valued genuine, transparent, mutually respectful relationships with researchers, where they felt they could be themselves. This was supported/facilitated by a friendly and familiar environment. The e-textile workshops, framed by the Person-Centred Approach, were experienced as convivial and therapeutic; they supported both male and female service users, and participants felt a sense of achievement and reported increased levels of confidence and social interaction, and lowered levels of anxiety. E-textile workshops are suitable for members of non-medicalised mental health services, even when they require the highest level of individual support.

There were some assumptions about the comfort of 'soft' being universal and participant feedback allowed us to see that some 'resistance' and solidity in the objects was preferred by some individuals. We also found that participants already managed their own anxiety by selecting particular routes and/or going at particular times of day or the week. These assumptions were exposed by offering participants freedom of expression on the walks, and then communicated to the rest of the research team in group reflection sessions. These reflections offered us a rationale for adapting and negotiating/agreeing research methods. Participant-led walks offered opportunities for expressing immediate experiencing of designed objects in the field; making meaning of those experiences, and reflecting on them in their personal context of relationships and emotional/psychological history. There was a sense of attachment to both the objects people had made, but also to the experience of the workshops - both content and process.

The Design Research community (including participatory design, service design, e-Textiles, wearables, the IoT, and HCI) was shown to either be unaware of the philosophies of care underpinning different practices in mental health care, or not to be reporting on them in the literature. The Person-Centred Approach was differentiated from the drivers for Personalisation in health care.

Participants, volunteers and staff found it difficult to imagine the IoT cognitively and responded well to experiential interactive demonstrators. Participants tended to want communication channels, not just ambient delivery of information. Different stakeholders want to develop different forms of data visualisation.

Service Design as a systemic endeavour faces unique barriers in the mental health and wellbeing sector in the UK due to different project funding timescales, the fragmentation of services, a strict audit culture, and differences in fundamental philosophies of care (including differing criteria for success). We found that this was not limited to our own experience, but was also reported by national bodies.

The Future Workshops method includes an element of fantasy, which participants in this sector simply could not engage with. The issues that mental health service users are living with are so fundamental that the most fantastical, wonderful service they could imagine was 'friendly', 'clean', communicated with, and 'listened' to them. As one individual said, &amp;quot;I just want to know what crisis teams do&amp;quot;.


[WP2 - e-textile development] we found that:

The mental health domain necessitates a flexible approach to participatory design (and design research) workshop planning, including content and timings, to dynamically support the therapeutic growth of the individual within the context of the workshops themselves.

The non-directivity of the Person-Centred Approach as applied to design research methodology does not provide constraints for textile and interaction designers in the way a User-Centred methodology does, and this can be experienced as frustrating. On reflection, we realized that the word 'practice' meant something quite different for different members of the team; the assumption was that 'artistic practice' in interactive textiles could be carried out without a user-led brief, but this wasn't the case. We also found that textile designers are not trained in user-centred or human-centred methods and ideologies, so testing a novel methodology was difficult. 

There is a need as textile design becomes electronic textile design, for soft (textiles based) plug and play structures for designers, to support prototyping activity.&amp;nbsp;


[WP3 - networking structures and data analytics] we found that:

We found that each of the networking topologies can be implemented, and verified that each of them were suitable methods for making networks of soft things.

We found that smart phones or tablets were suitable for providing a mobile internet gateway, where enterprise networks and/or a lack of infrastructure made connectivity difficult. We believe the optimal solution is some form of mobile application to accompany the soft devices, to have 2 primary uses: to provide connectivity to the cloud where none is available, and to customise soft things, as cloud objects, to user requirements.

This is not dependent on end users being able to use smart phones themselves; no one in the first mental health participant group had a smart phone at all, so the development of apps for end users is not necessarily the best way forward.

Throughout the life of the project, software solutions for the IoT have been quickly maturing; we implemented code using event hubs and mobile services to keep pace as Microsoft Azure has matured, but some of the code developed will be quickly superseded. Passing data directly into Azure learning was shown to be feasible for future mobile learning applications.

Latent Semantic Analysis and the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm are helpful for sorting data on anxiety levels and can successfully be informed by relational approaches from psychotherapy to create a novel data analytics model.

This analysis model can reveal the types of words participants use to express themselves and allows for the identification of anxious and 'not so anxious participants'; it can support participants in recognizing their own triggers of anxiety in everyday scenarios and to become more aware of each other's need for support and to co-develop concepts for peer support. 

Networked smart textiles in the wild afford an experientially informed platform for doing meaningfully user-led service design with data in the IoT.

Our participants wanted to stay in touch with Mind, as a supportive organization and safe place; many did not want to create a network with the other mental health service users in the group. Some wanted the option to be in supportive contact with each other through their custom soft devices. Many people liked to be able to see live data without necessarily knowing what it was doing.

Volunteer training is has been delivered to enable scaled-up delivery of the workshops.

National Mind has launched a new service design initiative, which we are making contact with to share our findings.

The local Clinical Commissioning Group has asked for qualitative research outcomes to complement the existing quantitative information they already have for the region; findings from the final service design and future workshop phases in particular will be useful for them in planning a new mental health and wellbeing resource 'hub'.

Participatory design researchers and practitioners will be able to use novel methods (IPR) and methodology (PCAD) to work in a more informed way with mental health communities through our academic publications and workshop demonstrations.

There are a number of planned future activities, subject to funding:
&amp;middot; Follow up with Oakfield School to implement an immersive room with soft input things
&amp;middot; Make the 'tree of positive reinforcement' devised by one of the participants
&amp;middot; Continue development of the modular e-textile tools 
&amp;middot; Design of a stand-alone teaching module for designing with mental health and wellbeing

However, the methodology sought to create an equal relationship and we witnessed a change in the capacity of several participants as they became co-researchers, and as their personal mental health improved. 

Three took part in reflective interviews on film, now publicly available on YouTube (see separate academic outputs entry); two went on to co-deliver workshops, becoming facilitators and scaling up the reach of the e-textile workshop as an intervention for mental health. 

These co-researcher/facilitators are now in discussion with the research team and staff at Bassetlaw Mind to develop the framework for an advisory group on design research and mental health.

The two samples presented here are temperature sensors based on thermocouples principles. The ?rst sample is of type E (Chromel - Constantan), the second is of type T (Copper-&amp;shy; Constantan). 
 
Thermocouples are self-&amp;shy;generating sensors used for temperature-&amp;shy;sensing. These sensors translate the temperature into a reference voltage, resistance or current. There are di?erent types of thermocouples: 
Type E (Chromel - Constantan) Type J (Iron - Constantan) Type K (Chromel - Alumel) 
Type M (Ni/Mo 82%/18% - Ni/Co 99.2%/0.8%, by weight) Type N (Nicrosil - Nisil) 
Type T (Copper - Constantan) 
 
Materials: 
1. Constantan High-&amp;shy;Flex 8394 7&amp;times;1(Karl Grimm) + Linen Inox thread (Bart Francis) - Sensor type E 2. Constantan resistive wire + Cooper resistive wire (Conrad) - Sensor type T 

Techniques: Several techniques can be used to have as many as need it hot points into the structure of the fabric. The sample is illustrated by sewing and embroidery techniques, but knitting and weaving can also be considered. (see, for example, tapestry diagonal interlock technique).</gtr:description><gtr:id>B20C993A-15A9-4034-9FA4-768643D2365E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A ?rst prototype of the &amp;quot;Drawing sensors&amp;quot; project was the &amp;quot;Textile Thermocouple&amp;quot; sample. It was included in the E-&amp;shy;textiles Swatch Book 2015. The E-&amp;shy;Textile Summercamp's Swatch Book Exchange is a platform for sharing physical work samples in the ?eld of electronic textiles. The exchange wishes to emphasize the 
importance of physicality and quality workmanship in an increasingly digital world. 

Everybody who has a4ended the E-&amp;shy;Textile Summercamp at least one time is allowed to take part in this exchange. Calls for participation are generally published 2 months before the summercamp. Individuals and collaborative e?orts participate in the exchange by submitting a unique swatch design of their own, and in turn receive a compiled collection of everybody else's swatches. This means that everybody participating needs to make as many multiples of their swatch as the total number of participants. Participants in the Swatch Exchange have diverse links to the e-&amp;shy;textile community, including academic researchers, textile designers, industrial designers, artists, electrical engineers and enthusiastic makers. 
There are no guidelines de?ning what these samples could or should be, only that they relate to the ?eld of E-&amp;shy;Textiles. Preferably each swatch should be able to mount on a 13x16cm area, and while ?at swatches 
lend themselves well to the book format, 3D swatches are also welcome.
