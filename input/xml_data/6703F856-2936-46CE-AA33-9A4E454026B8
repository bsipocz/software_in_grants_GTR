However about one third of patients with major depression respond poorly to current treatments and endure severely disrupted family, social and working life. Psycho-social treatments for chronic and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) are currently limited in effectiveness and understudied. Many TRD and chronically depressed patients suffer from a personality disorder (PD) or problems such as being perfectionist or rigid or avoiding risks. PDs are difficult to treat and patients with both depression and a PD respond poorly to both drug therapies and psychological treatments like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). However, standard Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), a type of CBT, has proven efficacy in treating Borderline PD, reducing suicide risk, and reducing symptoms of depression in patients with PD. Radically Open DBT (RO-DBT), a new treatment approach with strong roots in standard DBT, has demonstrated promise for patients with difficult-to-treat depression and related overcontrolled disorders. We shall test this new RO-DBT protocol for participants with TRD in a randomised controlled trial with two stages. At the beginning of the study we shall show that we can recruit suitable participants and that our therapists can work with the RO-DBT manual; following this we shall continue recruiting until we reach a total of 276 participants across 3 sites. The trial will compare treatment as usual (TAU) with RO-DBT as a complement to TAU. Over six months the DBT group will concurrently receive TAU plus 27 individual RO-DBT sessions and 29 group RO-DBT sessions, all from experienced therapists; and a second group will receive only TAU. We shall measure efficacy by comparing groups after treatment, and also six and 12 months later (i.e. 7, 12 and 18 months after randomisation). The primary outcome will be symptoms of depression. Secondary outcomes will include remission from depression and suicidal thoughts/behaviour. We shall make extra measurements to help understand how RO-DBT helps depressed participants. The highly experienced research team is led by Prof Thomas Lynch at the University of Southampton one of the world's leading researchers in RO-DBT who will be supported by clinical teams expert in delivering RO-DBT. Prof Ian Russell and his team at Swansea University will provide expertise in clinical trials, and Dr Sarah Byford at the Institute of Psychiatry in London will provide expertise in health economics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Even with best treatment one third of patients with major depression do not achieve symptom relief and suicidal behaviour is more likely among those with chronic depression. A major cause of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is co-morbid personality disorder (PD), present in 40-60% of these patients. The most common PDs reported in these patients are behaviourally over-controlled (obsessive-compulsive, paranoid &amp;amp; avoidant). Depressed PD patients are 4 times more likely to have continuing or relapsing depression than those without PD; they respond poorly to psychotherapies and psychotropic drugs. Standard Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) has proved to be effective in treating borderline PD. Radically Open DBT (RO-DBT), a new treatment approach with strong roots in standard DBT, has demonstrated promise for patients with difficult-to-treat depression and related overcontrolled disorders. Several studies have informed the development of RO-DBT for TRD, in conjunction with a theoretical model which describes the maintenance of depressive symptoms and the barriers to successful treatment. This theory centers on the role of rigid coping styles, lack of emotional expression and openness, and limited psychological insight. These characteristics, common in TRD patients, limit opportunities for learning new skills, exacerbate aloofness and the belief that the patient is unlovable, and perpetuate constricted patterns of behaviour. Further, the model predicts that negative experiences early in childhood may exacerbate a biological predisposition to heightened threat sensitivity and diminished reward sensitivity, and in turn initiate this over-controlled coping style. We propose a 2-arm, 2-stage, 3-centre RCT of RO-DBT for participants with TRD. All participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU), mainly antidepressant medication, and complete outcome assessments over 18 months. We shall use these assessments to compare combined TAU and RO-DBT lasting 29 weeks with TAU alone. We aim to estimate efficacy and cost-effectiveness of RO-DBT, addressing the effects of both allocation to RO-DBT and receiving RO-DBT (exposure). We propose several innovative adaptations to our RCT to enable us to use cutting-edge statistical methods to estimate the causal effects of mediating variables including treatment-exposure, therapeutic alliance and skill-learning. During stage 1 we shall recruit 26 participants to assess recruitment, adherence and client satisfaction. In stage 2 we shall recruit participants at 3 sites, randomising another 250. The primary outcome depressive symptoms will be measured at randomisation, and 7 , 12 and 18 months later. TL (Southampton), one of the world's leading researchers in RO-DBT, heads our experienced trial team. ITR (Swansea) provides expertise in clinical trials, and PC (Bristol) in causal analysis. Together TL, ITR and PC have been CI or PI on more than 50 RCTs, most in many centres.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>944293</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Solent radio interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D30631FC-1755-4705-A116-5B186ADCA3A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CI gave a radio interview on BBC Radio Solent about the REFRAMED study.
