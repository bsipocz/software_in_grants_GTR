HNSCC is the second most common malignancy in Malaysia encompassing 13.2% of the total cancer incidence. In the UK, incidence of HNSCC has risen dramatically since the late 1970s (+92%) to over 7500 cases/year. Management of HNSCC patients is often by a costly multidisciplinary approach involving surgery and/or radiotherapy followed by reconstruction and rehabilitation. Treatment results in considerable physical and psychological morbidity and may not prolong life. The 5-year survival rates for HNSCC have been relatively static for decades at around 50-60%. It is clear than new treatments are required.

Immunotherapy represents the most promising new cancer therapy for several decades. These treatments harness the power of the patient's immune system to fight the cancer, in the same way that the immune system might fight a virus. Cancers are recognised by the immune system as &amp;quot;foreign' because they express proteins (antigens) not usually found in normal tissues. Some patients have a strong immune response against their cancer, causing immune cells (killer lymphocytes) to attack and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapeutic drugs have been designed to boost this response, enhancing lymphocyte killing, and these have produced exciting clinical results in lots of cancer types. However, in most HNSCC patients, cancers do not provoke a strong immune response. By turning cancer antigens into powerful vaccines we can make the immune system recognise and react to the cancer; by combining the vaccines with other immunotherapeutic drugs, our hope is that we can generate an overwhelming immune attack against the cancer. 

The Cancer Research Malaysia (CRM) team have identified two novel cancer antigens (MAGED4B, FJX1) present in HNSCC in Malaysian patients. Notably, these cancer antigens are also expressed by UK HNSCC patients. The purpose of this study is to make vaccines against these antigens, using a novel vaccine design developed by the University of Southampton (UoS) that has previously been tested clinically. The new vaccines will be tested in a humanised mouse cancer model developed by the CRM team. The vaccines will be combined with several types of immunotherapeutic drugs designed to boost lymphocyte killing power, to identify the most effective combination. The UoS team has extensive experience in examining patients' immune responses to cancer, and will examine the visibility of MAGED4B/FJX1 antigens to the immune system of HNSCC patients. Finally, the UoS team will develop new mouse models of HNSCC which will form the basis for immunotherapy testing in future studies.

If successful, the results from this pre-clinical study will be used to develop early phase clinical testing of vaccine combinations in both countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Worldwide, head &amp;amp; neck cancer (HNSCC), is the sixth most common cancer (annual estimated incidence &amp;gt;400,000) and is a significant health burden in both Malaysia and the UK. HNSCC is often difficult to treat; surgery &amp;amp; radiotherapy, remain standard treatments, but despite improvements, are associated with significant morbidity and a relatively static 5-year survival rate of around 50-60%. 

Immunotherapy is the most promising new cancer therapy for several decades; immune checkpoint inhibitors against CTLA4 and PD1/PDL1 have shown efficacy across cancer types, including HNSCC. To improve response rates there is significant interest in combining checkpoint inhibitors with other immunotherapeutics including costimulatory receptor agonists (eg. CD27) and therapeutic vaccines against tumour-associated antigens (TAA). Few common TAA are described in HNSCC however, the Cancer Research Malaysia (CRM) team has identified MAGED4B and FJX1 as highly expressed in both Malaysian and UK patients; these represent excellent targets for vaccine development.

The project aims to develop and test the efficacy of DNA vaccines encoding full length MAGED4B and FJX1 antigens. These will be integrated into the clinically-tested University of Southampton vaccine design that incorporates the tetanus toxin domain (Dom) to provide linked CD4 T-cell help for optimal CD8+ T-cell induction. Vaccines will be tested in a humanised syngeneic cancer mouse model in combination with antibodies targeting anti-PD1 and anti-CD27. Tissues from UK and Malaysian HNSCC patients (all HLA class I and II genotyped) will be analysed for the presence of MAGED4B and FJX1 antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells, and specific antigenic peptides identified. New murine syngeneic HNSCC models will also be developed for use in future immunotherapy studies.

This will establish proof-of-principle of a new therapeutic vaccine concept to manage HNSCC patients, and inform design of future immunotherapy HNSCC trials</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Head and neck cancer (HNSCC) is a major global health concern with &amp;gt;400,000 cases each year, yet remains a relatively understudied tumour type. This has impacted on clinical outcome, with 5-year patient survival rates remaining relatively static at 50-60% for several decades. Management of patients is often by a costly multidisciplinary approach involving surgery and/or radiotherapy followed by reconstruction and rehabilitation. Treatment results in considerable physical and psychological morbidity and may not prolong life. In the UK the cost of treating a HNSCC patient averages at around &amp;pound;15K (&amp;gt;&amp;pound;100M NHS annual cost). Although no governmental information is available on the cost of treatment spent for HNSCC, based on data released by the Oral Cancer Foundation USA, an estimation of USD 0.32 billion (10% of US annual HNSCC spend) is spent by the Malaysia government. 

Immunotherapy is rapidly gaining its place as a mainstream treatment of solid cancers; antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD1, show efficacy in around 25% of HNSCC patients. Most patients do not benefit from monotherapy, and there is significant interest in combining checkpoint inhibitors with other immunotherapeutics including costimulatory receptor agonists and therapeutic vaccines directed against shared or patient-specific mutated tumour-associated antigens. Few common tumour antigens have been identified in HNSCC patients; this project aims to examine immunotherapeutic combinations targeting novel tumour antigens identified by the Cancer Research Malaysia team, and using technologies and assays developed by the University of Southampton team. 

The data from pre-clinical testing will establish essential proof-of-principle for a new, cost-effective therapeutic vaccine concept to manage a large and economically important group of patients. These data will be used to inform design of the next group of randomized immunotherapy HNSCC trials; more generically the putative biomarkerof vaccine immunogenicity that we will identify in this study is anticipated to improve patient selection and monitoring and subsequently improve the efficacy of immunotherapy treatments. The development of immunotherapies that can successfully treat HNSCC and prevent disease recurrence will have significant economic impact and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) cost-benefit.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>208804</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P013414/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
