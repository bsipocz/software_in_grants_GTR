This project exploits our expertise in specialist locomotives to better meet the market need for the tunnelling and construction sectors where productivity, efficiency and safety are of critical importance. We will create a new class of compact, electric locomotive offering the highest level of tractive effort for its mass. The design will be optimised for use in demanding construction environments where physically smaller locomotives provide advantages with space, operational flexibility and lower inertial mass. Additional benefits include lower lifetime running costs, zero emissions and easy adaptation for subsequent re-deployment between construction projects. Clayton's standards of engineering excellence are already globally recognised, delivering highly durable and reliable solutions capable of operating in the most demanding of environments. The tunneling sector has been enjoying typical CAGR of 6-7% in recent years and now is the ideal time to deliver better products, allowing the industry to become even more competitive.

Tunnel construction is used to serve the needs of road, rail, sewer and water construction projects. The industry utilises heavy engineering equipment in confined spaces, where skilled staff, raw materials and waste must be transported safely and efficiently in and out of a hazardous environment. With larger projects taking years to complete, waste haulage rates play a vital role in maintaining the rate at which a tunneling project can progress. The locomotive determines how much load the train can carry, how fast it can travel and how quickly it can stop. In turn, this determines the efficiency of construction and the overall cost of the project. Clayton will develop a truly novel locomotive design specifically tailored to the tunneling sector, offering best-in-class performance for tractive effort, reliability, acceleration and braking power. These features will be optimised to reduce wear and lifetime operating costs. The new locomotive will be electrically powered, providing clean and efficient operation, reducing the need for tunnel ventilation and the energy associated with this activity. This project will ensure that Clayton can meet stakeholder expectations for years to come, with class-leading locomotives suitable for exploitation in global markets. This will deliver export opportunities and having previously delivered complex, demanding and prestigious projects, Clayton is well placed to ensure that further investments in the business will deliver growth and job creation. This project will further develop UK engineering capability, support business diversification and provide excellent opportunities for economic growth.&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>419572</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">104143</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
