As such, the research in this field is multidisciplinary, presenting communication challenges for the exchange of knowledge between researchers, regulators, and industry. The work within the Environmental Nanoscience Initiative (ENI) Phase 2 programme was designed to address the potential impacts that nanomaterials may have on the environment in its widest form. This Knowledge Exchange Fellowship is designed to help promote the dissemination and understanding of the research outputs to key bodies and individuals who have been identified has having an interest in this area. In doing so, the Fellowship will bring together the researchers from across the programme through a series of visits and consolidate their individual research outputs to provide a cohesive statement of the current understanding within specific sectors. These statements will be obtained using a combine, communicate, and collaborate approach promoting the development of these multidisciplinary collaborations. 
The knowledge exchange between the different interested parties will be achieved by:
- Visiting and meeting with Phase 2 contributors, regulators and industry bodies to develop an understanding of the different communication and information needs of the different groups;
- Developing case study illustrations, using Phase 2 contributor outputs to highlight current research within different areas and promoting their academic papers and other research outputs;
- Using the case studies and communication needs of each group to develop short communications (leaflets, presentations) that can be used by other interested parties to disseminate research outputs from the Phase 2 programme of research;
- Promoting a clear visual identity and web presence for the ENI community;
- Running an industry-centric workshop in a central location where researchers can actively network to kick start collaborations;
- Developing a nano-engagement toolkit to promote exchange within the nanoscience community;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69502</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation by Jim Zhang to European Respiratory Society International Conference, London, September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA0D2AEA-5435-4D41-BC54-9B96ECFFD7C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funds from the KE grant were used to support Prof Jim Zhang from California to attend the European Respiratory Society International Conference in London to publicise the outputs from the ENI Phase 2 consortia and the impact of nanotechnology on air pollution.

The outputs have been communicated to the industrial, academic and regulatory communities. Industrial dissemination has been achieved mainly via trade organisations. The regulatory communities interested in both water and soil protection have been interested in the larger picture from the research community. Funding from this grant has helped disseminate UK academic and industrial capabilities to other countries. It has been possible to demonstrate a benefit from the UK/US consortia, with the three funded research projects providing a platform to promote community building within academia and to expand academic partnerships into the supporting industrial sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F575D1D7-7CC6-449E-8FCB-9326E08FDE54</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6d20791e64.29267915</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M006948/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A635FDF-4DC1-48AB-A010-04619A0042EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Assess/Remediate Contamination</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6A654DB9-716E-4BAC-867B-E1CE45A994F6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecotoxicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B6F999D-9DC2-4BDE-A15B-6A212E9ADB62</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Waste Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
