The MRC Clinical Trials Unit and the Respiratory Trials Unit at Churchill Hospital in Oxford are involved in a programme of studies in pleural diseases and sleep disorders. The pleural cavity is the space between the lung and the chest wall which in certain diseases accumulates fluid which needs to be drained. Pleural effusions may have several possible causes, in particular infection or malignancy. A series of multi-centre trials are addressing the question how can this effusion be most effectively treated and drained.||Sleep disorders are common within the adult population and can result in severe tiredness during daytime leading to inability to work effectively and sometimes result in serious accidents. The most advanced cases of sleep apnoea are most effectively managed by the patient wearing a mask to assist breathing at night. It is uncertain whether similar benefits can be obtained in those with moderate sleep apnoea. One of the trials in the collaboration is assessing that together with the potential for the mask to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The CTU has been collaborating with the Respiratory Trials Unit (RTU) at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford over a number of years in the conduct of multi-centre trials. The main focus of the research programme is in pleural disease and sleep disorders. Although in the past the British Thoracic Society was active in multi-centre trials in respiratory disease in recent years there was been very limited funding and little activity in this area apart from trials in lung cancer. The current initiative began with a trial, MIST1, which assessed the role of streptokinase in pulmonary empyema; this was funded by the MRC and was a collaboration between the RTU in Oxford and the Clinical Trials Unit. The unexpected findings from that multi-centre trial has had considerable influence over the management of that condition and led to further trials and has provided important information on the nature of the pathogens involved in this disease and the corresponding differences in outcomes. A second trial assessing whether DNase or Alteplase, improve pleural fluid drainage in pleural infection, (MIST2) was recently completed A further series of trials in pleural disease is focussed on patients with malignant pleural effusions. These trials (TIME1 and TIME2) are addressing problems associated with pleurodesis (preventing re-accumulation of fluid), in particular the most optimum form of drainage and the analgesic most likely to minimise the associated pain. Smaller drains may be less painful but may not be as effective. TIME3 is addressing the role of fibrinolytics in reducing breathlessness.||Sleep disorders affect around 4% of the adult male population. Poor quality sleep associated with frequent waking through the night can lead to sever daytime symptoms which inhibit the ability to work effectively and may lead to accidents, particularly in drivers. For patients with severe obstructive sleep apnoea trials have shown the most effective treatment to be nasal CPAP which enables the patient to have a good nights sleep. The role of CPAP in those with moderate sleep apnoea is less clear, however there may be benefits in terms of reduction in risk factors for cardiovascular disease since CPAP reduces blood pressure while sleeping. The MOSAIC trial assesses whether there is benefit in sleepiness reduction in patients with moderate apnoea and whether their risk factor scores, as measured by the Framingham index, can be reduced. The PREDICT trial is assessing whether older patients could benefit from CPAP.|</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12023/18</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>4CFCFE99-281F-452D-9C77-757ECDBEB0DC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.3  Medical devices</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
