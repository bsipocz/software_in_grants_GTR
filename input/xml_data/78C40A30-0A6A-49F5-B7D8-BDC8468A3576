Easy: you count the edges E or vertices V. In fact, these two &amp;quot;invariants&amp;quot; are equivalent, since they are related by the equation X=V-E+F, where F counts the number of two dimensional surfaces or &amp;quot;faces&amp;quot; outlined by edges, and X is a centuries-old invariant called the Euler characteristic. An n-gon has Euler characteristic X=n-n+1=1, while the surface of a football has Euler characteristic X=60-90+32=2. In fact, any 2-dimensional sphere has X=2, no matter how it is &amp;quot;quilted.&amp;quot; A quilt wrapping a bagel has Euler characteristic 0, and the surface of a G-holed pretzel has X=2-2G. Another invariant, the &amp;quot;fundamental group,&amp;quot; has made recent headlines, between Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture and Agol's Breakthrough Prize research. The fundamental group keeps track of possible ways to wrap string around an object. The string just falls off a football, but it can wrap countably many times around a bagel or get hopelessly tangled on a pretzel.

A lot of the work of mathematicians in geometry and topology deals with &amp;quot;invariants&amp;quot; analogous to these. The quilted surfaces above are called 2-manifolds, since built from 2-dimensional pieces. I study an invariant for 3-manifolds called Heegaard Floer homology (HF), which was invented to help calculate a 4-manifold invariant that distinguishes different self-consistent ways of doing calculus on 4-manifolds. Although HF is nearly 2 decades old, in many cases it remains a mystery what HF should tell us about these 3-manifolds.

There are some recent conjectures, however, which might provide keys to unlock this mystery. Boyer, Gordon, and Watson have conjectured a dichotomy between 3-manifolds with vanishing HF--&amp;quot;L-spaces&amp;quot;--and 3-manifolds for which all the wrappings in the fundamental group can be given an &amp;quot;left order&amp;quot; (LO)--a special ordering on the group which is self-consistent with respect to the addition of additional string wraps. Juhasz, meanwhile, has conjectured a dichotomy between L-spaces and 3-manifolds with a co-oriented taut foliation (CTF)--a certain way of sculpting a 3-manifold out of planes (like sheets of paper) and 2-manifolds with negative Euler characteristic. Nemethi has recently proven a theorem relating L-spaces to algebraic singularities--special squashed up points governed by relationships among polynomials.

Inspired by these observations, my own research strives to move beyond such dichotomies and instead use HF as a tool to distinguish and count LOs, CTFs, and certain other structures. This approach has never been taken before, but I have already developed new tools which have begun to deliver results. Success in any one of these endeavours could revolutionize the types of questions geometers and topologists are able to answer.

In fact, it is astonishing how little mathematicians still know about the 3-dimensional geometry and topology of the world we inhabit, even though the behaviour of intricately tangled objects, particularly at the molecular level, impacts our daily lives. For example, the topology of knotted DNA influences the speed with which topoisomerase enzymes can prepare DNA for transcription, an important factor for certain cancer treatments in development. Dr Dorothy Buck at Imperial College studies questions such as these, and many of her students use Heegaard Floer homology to advance our understanding of the 3-dimensional topology of knots and tangles. Who knows what applications of HF the future might hold?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic impact: The primary impact of my proposed research will be the immediate academic impact on the mathematical research community. Finding enumerative interpretations for Heegaard Floer homology will make gauge theoretic tools relevant to other areas of mathematics, and vice versa, for the fields of complex algebraic geometry, foliation/lamination theory, and group theory.

Impact for mathematicians in training: My new lecture course in 3-manifolds, together with Cambridge's offer to support me in recruiting and training a new PhD student, will help the proposed research to impact a younger generation of mathematicians.

Scientific impact: Improving our understanding of topological invariants, particularly for 3-manifolds and for knots, has potential applications to a diverse collection of areas of physics research, for example including vortices in fluid mechanics and topological quantum computing. The topology of knotting and unknotting also impacts DNA transcription in biomedical applications.

Dissemination: The travel support provided by this fellowship will facilitate dissemination of my results at seminars and conferences, and will promote collaborations with other researchers.

Public engagement: Through interaction with educators in Pavilion E (the departmental building housing my office) developing secondary school curriculum, I can impact the ways that adolescents are exposed to notions from topology. The Science Festival at Cambridge provides an opportunity for me to set up an interactive display engaging the public with structures involved in my research. Low dimensional topology is an unusually visual and concrete field of pure mathematics, making many aspects of it unusually accessible to a public audience. My proposed research in particular involves structures such as knots, foliations, and triangulations, with which a lay person can physically interact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>244454</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R02359X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
