Along with archaeological remains, the historical writings related to the establishment of the so-called Virreinatos constitute primary sources of information for the understanding of this period. An extended compilation of information ordered by the Spanish crown in the 16th century, called Relaciones Geogr&amp;aacute;ficas, served to gather vast amounts of information about the New World through multiple records and descriptions, both in Spanish and indigenous style. Traditional research of these documents has relied on the close reading of a handful of these texts, which can take the scholar a life-time to examine. Using a Big-Data approach, this project will apply for the first time ground-breaking computational methodologies to study one of the most important sources for the colonial history of America, and it will identify, extract, cross-link, and analyse information of vital importance to historical enquiry. Our highly interdisciplinary team will combine techniques from different disciplines, including Corpus Linguistics, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Geographic Information Systems, to address questions related to the recording of information about indigenous cultures, the Spanish exploration of indigenous social and religious concepts, the appropriation and ideas about place and space in the indigenous world, and their attitudes towards politics and economy. In doing so, the project will transform the way historical sources and large corpora are approached and analysed by modern scholars.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While the development of the project will have significant value for established practitioners of history, archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, digital humanities, and computer science, working in a range of subdisciplines, we are strongly committed to form a skill-base of new academics with a robust history of collaborative work and interdisciplinary mind set. As such, we think that working with different strategies related to education, networking, and publicity will generate a positive impact and encourage the adoption of interdisciplinary methods and relations by a broad audience. We have identified a number of ways in which we will do this: the project will employ research associates, post-doctoral researchers; it will offer a PhD studentship; and it will organise short courses, local seminars, and expert workshops. One studentship in Computer Science will be offered by the project and is described in section a of the PMDC. In addition, the project will employ three research associates working in Corpus Linguistics/NLP, two senior research associates, one in Computational Linguistics and one in Spatial Humanities, one post-doctoral researcher in NLP and Computational Social Science, and two postgraduate researchers specialised in Mexican Colonial History. All of them will work in a highly interdisciplinary environment and will develop considerable skills in their own fields, as well as in Digital Humanities. Where adequate, they will contribute to publications either as co-authors or on their own, and the team leaders will look to actively support their academic development. 
The Universities of Lisbon and Chester will contribute, at no cost to the project, with the organisation of two courses each year, one in Spatial Humanities (Chester), and another in NLP and Machine Learning (a summer school in Lisbon). In addition, a focused conference and extended workshop in computational approaches to historical texts will be organised in year 2 by our team in Mexico. The PI and the team leaders have extensive experience delivering courses in these topics, which have a huge demand across Europe and beyond.
The results of the project will be disseminated to students and an academic audience via workshops, papers in conferences, at least five articles in international peer-reviewed journals, and multiple contributions to other possible book collections. The outputs will target journals from a range of disciplines (archaeology, history, linguistics, computer science, geography, digital humanities) and period-specialisation, looking to reach a broad and diverse academic audience. In order to disseminate our findings to stakeholders beyond the academy, including heritage managers, librarians, educators, and the wider public, the team will contribute to public lecture series and will engage actively with social media, the project's blog, and media interviews. Our project will therefore enhance both academic and public appreciation of the possibilities in the use of data and the development of digital technologies and methods for a wide range of research in Humanities fields. From the start of the project, our aims and emerging results will be communicated to the public on a website maintained by the University of Chester. This will be linked to an active presence in social media via Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus. The blog and a dedicated YouTube channel will feature our research processes and experiments, as well as videos of lectures and presentations. 
All resources and code generated within the project will be stored in an open collaborative repository (i.e., the project's GitHub). The datasets (e.g., the annotated corpus and gazetteer) and other research outputs will be stored in the Digital Humanities Research Centre Repository and the Museo del Templo Mayor in Mexico, the UK Data Service and they will also be 'returned' to the Internet Archive and to Europeana.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161640</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R003890/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
