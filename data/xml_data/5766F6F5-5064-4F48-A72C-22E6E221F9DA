Positrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons with which they annihilate releasing gamma-rays. In addition to their importance in our fundamental understanding of nature, studies of their interactions with ordinary everyday matter allow us, for example, to investigate crystal structures and to obtain functional images of human organs using the medical technique of positron emission tomography (PET). In many collisions of positrons with matter, positronium (Ps) is formed.

Positronium is a composite made of a positron and electron, analogous to the hydrogen atom with the positron replacing the proton. So often is Ps formed, that e.g. 80% of gamma-rays detected in PET, and 95% of all gamma-rays released from the galactic centre of the Milky Way are the result of Ps decay. Once formed, it has ample time to interact with matter before annihilating because its lifetime, although of the order of nanoseconds, is still millions of times longer than typical scattering times. For these reasons, knowledge of how Ps itself interacts with matter is important not only for collision physics but also, for example, so that we may improve radioprotection in PET, or learn about the environment in which positrons annihilate in outer space. 

Since both experimental and theoretical studies with Ps projectiles are difficult, corresponding data are scarce or non-existent. Recently, however, we have discovered that positronium scatters from a wide variety of atomic and molecular targets in a similar manner to that of a bare electron at a given projectile velocity. This is not what was expected! And, whilst the reason is unclear, its ramifications at a fundamental and practical level might be far reaching. It looks like the positron in Ps is heavily screened (or &amp;quot;cloaked&amp;quot;) from the target by its partner electron and we wish to understand why. In the process, through the proposed research, we shall charter the outcome of such collisions and glimpse into the formation of Ps resonances and possibly Ps compounds. From a practical viewpoint, the outcome of the project may feed directly into models of how Ps interacts with matter, encompassing interstellar clouds and the human body.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outcomes of the proposed studies are expected to impact primarily on the academic sector through the supply of unique data and to aid the understanding of atomic interactions involving antimatter. However, it is envisaged that our results will also serve as an input, for example, into simulations of Ps collisions with matter including industrially important materials and biological tissue. 

Thus potential beneficiaries of the proposed research outside the academic sector may include those working, for example, in the materials and nuclear medicine industries, and of course their customers and patients. In particular for Positron Emission Tomography, an improved understanding of the microscopic distribution of the energy deposits along the positron tracks may result in improvement of imaging-resolution and more accurate radiation dosimetry. In the longer term, an advance of this type, leading to the development of better protocols for radioprotection and cancer radiotherapy, could benefit public health and hence society.

Economic benefits are also expected to arise for the public and private sectors through the training of talented young scientists in performing highly-skilled research and developing concomitant transferrable skills (e.g. numerical and computational, problem-solving, creative, communication, leadership) which are highly valued by businesses and organizations. Past group members have found employment in national and international laboratories, government departments, software development, scientific consulting and the finance sector, as well as in academia.

Research with antimatter continues to excite the imagination of the general public and mass media (from the matter-antimatter asymmetry to the recent discovery of antimatter-production in thunderstorms on Earth). It thus represents a powerful vehicle for stimulating further interest and promoting understanding in physics and science, especially among young people. In the framework of the departmental &amp;quot;Science for the Public&amp;quot; initiatives, we shall endeavour to promote public awareness and engagement with our research by delivering popular lectures, talks at schools and interested societies and through popular publications (e.g. last November our work featured in New Scientist and Physics World).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>468305</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Hungary, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>ATOMKI</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC4346C1-FDC0-4551-99C3-42330D022407</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Record 1 of 15

Collision physics can be like a game of billiards. Yet in the microscopic world, the outcome of the game is hard to predict. 
Fire a particle at a group of other particles, and they may scatter, combine or break apart, according to probability distributions governed by quantum mechanics. These processes can tell us about fundamental properties of matter and, if antimatter projectiles are used, also about matter-antimatter interactions. Scientists at UCL have finally answered one of the basic questions that has remained outstanding until now: if, in a collision with matter, a positron - the antimatter counterpart of electrons - captures an electron, in which directions are the two likely to travel, and with what probability? 
All matter particles - electrons, protons, neutrons - have an antimatter counterpart. Antiparticles have very similar properties to particles, but the opposite electrical charge. Although they are eventually annihilated when they come into contact with matter, antiparticles can briefly interact with particles to form very short-lived matter-antimatter hybrids, atoms in which one of the component particles has been replaced with an antiparticle. Of these, positronium - one electron and one positron in orbit around each other - is the most studied.
&amp;quot;Positrons and positronium are important for our understanding of the physical universe,&amp;quot; says Gaetana Laricchia (UCL Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy), who led the study. &amp;quot;They are also useful for applications such as probing the properties of materials, as well as for medical diagnostics. Yet there is much that we still do not know about their interactions with ordinary matter.&amp;quot;
In the study, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, Laricchia and colleagues have used UCL's Positronium Beam - a facility unique in the world - to investigate the behaviour of the positronium as it is created, and have finally been able to compare with theoretical predictions which have been developed over the past 40 years.
The Positronium Beam works by producing a beam of positrons from a radioactive source, passing it through a chamber full of hydrogen, where the positrons bind to electrons to form positronium. The resulting beam of positronium is then usually used to bombard other targets placed downstream. In this study, though, the team examined the formation of the positronium atoms themselves - much like using a microscope to study the way light passes through lenses.
&amp;quot;From the collision, the positronium atoms may emerge forward, sideways or backwards. The absolute proportions had never been measured,&amp;quot; says Laricchia. &amp;quot;We sought to analyse this because it tells you important information about how positrons collide in gases, how positronium behaves once it has formed and because it is a very sensitive test of theoretical models.&amp;quot;
As well as the hydrogen gas that is usually used in the Positronium Beam, the team also measured the emission of positronium created when hydrogen was replaced with argon, helium and carbon dioxide. They found that in the case of helium and hydrogen, the emission of positronium was broadly in line with a small subset of theories; for argon, the behaviour seems similar to that created in hydrogen and helium and quite different from theoretical predictions. For CO2, there is no prediction to test, and this experiment provides the first data of any kind.
In all four cases, there was a strong preference for the positronium to be emitted in the forward direction, particularly when the positrons were hitting the gas at high speed.
The team hope to carry out further investigations of positronium formation, particularly at lower energies which should provide even better calibration for the theoretical models</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b023e1aab524.53932082</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/maps1539</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UCL MAPS Website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3982E7D8-A9AB-494A-BC8F-84AFE6D2A022</gtr:id><gtr:impact>First direct sightings of low-energy positronium collisions

Positrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons with which they annihilate releasing gamma-rays. In addition to their importance in our fundamental understanding of nature, studies of their interactions with ordinary everyday matter allow us, for example, to investigate crystal structures and to obtain functional images of human organs using the medical scan technique of positron emission tomography (PET). In many collisions of positrons with matter, positronium (Ps) is formed.

Positronium is a hybrid made of a positron and an electron, analogous to the hydrogen atom with the positron replacing the proton. So often is Ps formed, that e.g. 80% of gamma-rays detected in PET, and 95% of all gamma-rays released from the galactic centre of the Milky Way are the result of Ps decay.

Once formed, Ps has ample time to interact with matter before annihilating because its lifetime, although of the order of nanoseconds, is still millions of times longer than typical scattering times. For these reasons, knowledge of how Ps itself interacts with matter is important not only for collision physics but also, for example, so that we may improve radioprotection in PET, or learn about the environment in which positrons annihilate in outer space. 

UCL researchers have now generated an energy-tunable beam of Ps atoms at energies five times lower than ever obtained before and made direct measurements of Ps scattering probabilities within the range 1.4-7 eV for the first time.

In the study, just published in the journal Physical Review Letters, Gaetana Laricchia and her team have found that the probabilities of Ps scattering from argon and xenon decrease with decreasing energy in a similar way to that of electron projectiles for which a quantum mechanical phenomenon (the Ramsauer-Townsend effect) results in &amp;quot;target transparency&amp;quot;. Professor Laricchia explained that this result contradicts the available predictions and poses a significant challenge to theories.

The work will aid scientists in better understanding the subtle collision effects for low energy Ps, its fundamental properties and develop accurate descriptions of matter-antimatter interactions and atomic collisions in general.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b02006a48e21.15548316</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/maps1560</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>560729</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Standard Research</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/P009395/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>8FAB46A2-29B0-465F-B916-5E7C400AD420</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b019bc643da1.28848085</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Positrons and positronium are fundamental to our understanding of the physical universe.

The efficiency for collimated positronium production by charge-exchange in positron collisions with gaseous targets has been investigated at high energies and CO2 has been found to be approximately twice as efficient as N2, the previous best neutralising gas at high energies. The efficiency from Xe, whilst lower at low energies, becomes comparable to that from H2 at around 100-120 eV; at ~250 eV, it is an order of magnitude lower.

The first absolute experimental determinations of the differential cross sections for the formation of ground-state positronium have been measured for He, Ar, H2, and CO2 near 0&amp;deg;. Results are compared with available theories. The ratio of the differential and integrated cross sections for the targets exposes the higher propensity for forward emission of positronium formed from He and H2.

We have produced a detectable flux of positronium atoms at beam energies five times lower than previously obtained, enabling total cross sections to be measured in the energy range ~(1-7) eV for the first time. In collision with Ar and Xe, the total cross sections of positronium are found to be smallest at the lowest energy probed, approaching those of the Ramsauer-Townsend minima for electron projectiles. Additional structure has been observed in the case of positronium scattering at incident energies around 5 eV.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the long term, positron/Ps scattering may also impact upon the risk assessment associated with medical diagnostics and therapeutic protocols of positron-emission-tomography, material characterization (primarily through annihilation,positronium formation and scattering).
