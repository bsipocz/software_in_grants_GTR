They also allow users to generate and transform multimedia content that they have produced themselves, and even to participate in collaborative ventures including commercial activities. Through what are technologically quite simple systems, people have shown a capacity and willingness to engage, participate and collaborate with others to create extensive and innovative resources. They are developing living and digital economies, although it is unclear how these relate to our conventional understandings of markets, and models of production and consumption. The emergence of further capabilities made available through mobile and pervasive devices, offer the potential of further extending the Digital Economy, not only for the general user to engage in social activities but also to extend and transform the ways people interact with and within organisations.In this research cluster, we wish to investigate these emergent practices, the capabilities of STS technologies, and explore how we can develop understandings of services, exchange and interaction that benefit the whole of the UK economy. We will survey existing research, and develop a novel research agenda that aims to change how we understand the role of new media and how we can shape innovative service and technology development. In order to ground the discussion in concrete examples, we will focus on the three key identified in the Digital Economy programme: healthcare, transportation and the creative industries. The cluster will be organised around a series nine open events where we will utilise a number of innovative techniques to develop a novel programme of research. These meetings will be of different kinds and duration: Context Setting Workshops will seek to identify opportunities, challenges, barriers and possibilities for innovative media in the three key sectors, then discussing the research issues that these raise. Expert Modelling Workshops are where those in the cluster concerned with current concepts, theories and methods will come together to begin to shape the agenda, clarifying the shortcomings of current research, and identifying ways in which disciplines can collaborate to address these. The Working Group Meeting will also suggest two or three exploratory exercises that can be undertaken within collaborating stakeholder organisations to clarify problematic topics. These exercises will serve as shared motivating examples to develop scenarios and to draw upon when developing research proposals. Scenario Workshops will develop scenarios for all three sectors. The project will conclude with a Final Showcase event where the research agenda will be presented to the wider academic community. Digital economies are complex systems with interdependencies between technology, social practice, policy, material infrastructures and more. To develop a programme of research and scenarios to inform innovation we require a unique combination of diverse research backgrounds, We combine experience in software engineering, the design and use of novel technologies, service design, the understanding of workplace and organisational activities, and the operation of markets. The cluster participants have been at the forefront of developing concepts, methods and theories for understanding the development, use and deployment of new technologies and media from a variety of different perspectives. We have participation from: the Universities of Oxford, Kings College London, Lancaster, Edinburgh, Goldsmith's College London, Nottingham, University College London, Sussex; and commercial and public organisations including BT, Orange, tangerine, AIG, KorteQ, NHS Direct, Dept of Transport.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>188831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Creative Industries Context Setting Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:id>838D35FF-0A61-49E8-8325-603C7A42EE4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshops used a mix of open and facilitated discussions among participants from a broad inter-disciplinary community, in order to identify opportunities, challenges, barriers and possibilities for innovative media in the creative industries sectors.

Each event had in excess of 50 participants, and more than 130 people involved in events and activities. The creation and sustaining of the community around issues relating to innovate media and the digital economy created interest and energy in this emerging domain. The IMDE research agenda benefited from input from all the cluster participants, particularly those who undertook the scoping studies. From these workshops 16 new collaborations emerged which undertook a series of small scale in depth investigations into specific areas funded by the cluster.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>73EBDE4C-AAA5-405A-9DD6-0BC10D2C7ACE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>r-9279560986.235329d3924a98</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Emergent practices - Internet enabled social networking, content creation and exchange is bringing about what is likely to be deep social change, much of which was beyond the scope of the Research Cluster to study in detail. It is clear that new modes and practices of cooperation are being forged, creating new communities which are interacting in different ways, using different organisational processes. There are new opportunities as well as challenges. 



The social-political-legal opportunties and challenges of IMDE - Immediately in the foreground are opportunities for community building and community-based forms of exchange and sense-making, as well as everyday innovation around products, services and modes of exchange. The challenges relate most pressingly to surveillance, privacy and IPR. Technology-enabled social networking affords means of gathering information about individuals, and combining different sources of information in ways that threaten privacy and extend the possibilities of surveillance, and the technology-enabled ways of contravening IPR are well-known. A recent report on IPR has found that 7 million people in the UK download material illegally, at huge economic cos. However, it would also be impossible to take legal action against 7 million downloaders. Thus, a different conceptualisation of IPR and different models for rewarding intellectual input and content creation need to be found. The way these develop in the medium and long term future are likely to have a very deep effect on social structures and systems. For example, it is not yet clear what the new business, service, financial or economic models will be for exchanging content on the Internet. In addition, there is also a great deal of unpredictability and uncertainty in the domain of social networking and user generated content, since the technologies and social processes and interactions co-evolve rather than being on a linear temporal trajectory. 



The different forms of social networking systems that were considered in the Research Cluster are embedded in a broader social, ethical and political framework and therefore require the input of a range of disciplines able to consider the broader framework. The Research Cluster had started out from the premise that traditional modes of thinking are challenged by the phenomena associated with social networking systems, and that new modes of inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary research are needed. There are several questions that need the input of specific disciplines, such as ethics and moral theory, social science, economics, political philosophy and political economy, law, etc. In our research cluster, we came across several lines of research of interest 



Ethics is another domain which is challenged at its core by the demands made by these technologies. Most often ethical challenges (such as the challenge to privacy or ownership) are framed in terms of the need to give guidelines and to provide answers that either evaluate consequences (cost/benefit analysis) or set out principles of conduct and behaviour. This approach is useful only up to a point, and we should be seeking ways to extend and challenge thinking on these questions. 

Before giving principles and norms we need to explore and understand more closely all the ethical implications that emerge in particular circumstances. In this respect different approaches like feminist ethics, disclosive ethics, context-sensitive ethics etc. can be very valuable and should be explored.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Innovative Media for a Digital Economy (IMDE) Research Roadmap sets out the main research questions and challenges are in this area, and which research strategies and other resources are needed in order to address them. This focussed on three areas for future research and explioitation: Creative industries, health and transport. The cluster's activities involved active participation from individuals from large public bodies (such as the NHS, BBC, Department of Transport), large companies (such as BT, Orange), small start ups and SMEs (such as Engine, AIG, tangerine, KorteQ, CPC Ltd) and smaller community groups (such as AccessGrid). The cluster participants were at the forefront of developing concepts, methods and theories for understanding the development, use and deployment of new technologies and media from a variety of different perspectives. Some of these organisations had specific expertise in one of the sectors, others had more general experience on developing social media or in the broader management of system development projects or technical interventions. A final roadmap (http://www.mindmeister.com/17984994/innovative-media-for-the-digital-economy) lays out the critical issues for research and exploitation for the project. These pathways incliude:



o substantive investigations into emergent cultural, social and material (technologically augmented) digital economy practices and the role of social technology systems to inform future innovation, reaching from studies of trust to security, through investigations and comparisons of new service and exchange models, to reflections on everyday innovation and R&amp;amp;D methods 

o exploratory collaborative experimental development and implementations of new social technology systems, practices and models - not only through existing technologies and instrumental design, but also through art-based provocation, for reflection on opportunities, challenges and dangers

o trans- or post-disciplinary collaboration, including new methods for collaboration, between researchers from different disciplines, commercial and industrial developers, everyday users and artists with the aim of folding diverse insights and skills into socio-technical innovation. The aim of the IMDE research cluster was to develop research competence in the area of social media that was emerging at the time. Various projects built upon work undertaken in IMDE Research Cluster. These included:



Bridge - http://www.bridgeproject.eu - a 13 mio Euro EU FP7 interdisciplinary project concerned with designing technologies to support inter-agency collaboration in emergency response. IMDE research informed the design concepts or 'agile response' for social innovation.



Catalyst - http://www.catalystproject.org.uk/ - a 1.9M EPSRC funded project that sought to develop next generation social media for citizen engagement, IMDE research was instrumental in motivating this project, generating ideas, methodologies and contacts.



New Interaction Orders - http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/projects/new-interaction/ - a project funded by the Faculty of Social Sciences, Lancaster University, investigated the changing quality of public space and public engagement through the appropriation of mobile technologies in public spaces.
