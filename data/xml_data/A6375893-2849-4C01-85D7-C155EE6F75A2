in the independent fast food sector</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L002051/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Public health concerns regarding rising levels of obesity have led to the development of several initiatives to encourage fast food outlets and their customers to adopt healthier catering and consumption practices. These have had varying degrees of success.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project builds on research with the independent fast food sector which has identified barriers to the adoption of healthier catering practices - particularly with businesses operating in more deprived areas. It will be working with public health officials developing and managing healthier catering initiatives to identify:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>business models that involve the sale of healthier fast food that work for independent outlets - particularly in deprived areas&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>healthier changes that fast food businesses will adopt voluntarily and the barriers where a greater degree of intervention may be required, such as legislation or intervention with supply chains&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>behaviour change strategies (nudges) that can successfully be used by fast food businesses to encourage healthier consumption patterns amongst their customers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>ways in which suppliers can be encouraged to reformulate or promote products to encourage businesses to purchase healthier varieties.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The outputs will include a toolkit to assist those involved in promoting healthier catering practices with SMEs and policy briefings outlining feasible intervention strategies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit public health practitioners working to encourage independent fast food businesses to adopt healthier menus and catering practices. These include environmental health officers, nutritionists and other public health officials, who are at the forefront of delivering healthy catering initiatives. These staff will benefit from the project by being able to access a set of tools including evidence of good practice, case studies of behaviour change strategies and healthier business models, and advice on working with suppliers, that can be used to support their work with businesses. The resources developed by the project will be widely disseminated, via conferences, workshops, partners' networks and websites, thus ensuring that they are accessible to public health officials across the UK and beyond. 

These tools will also benefit the businesses operating in the independent fast food sector by providing them with constructive ideas regarding ways in which they can adapt their menus or catering practices to offer healthier products without negatively impacting on business profitability.

In particularly encouraging independent fast food businesses operating in deprived areas to adopt and offer affordable healthier menus the project is designed to contribute to improving the health and well-being of local residents who are currently experiencing disproportionate levels of obesity. 

The project will support the work of the London Food Team at the GLA, who have a brief to develop resources to support boroughs in dealing with fast food outlets and have begun mapping suppliers to the fast food sector in London. The project will assist them by identifying possibilities for taking upstream action to drive product reformulation, or changes to the marketing mix that suppliers can be encouraged to adopt. By enabling the fast food operators and their suppliers to voice what they see as the obstacles to providing healthier food the project will assist the GLA and other policy makers in being able to come up with genuinely feasible approaches. 

Suppliers participating in the project will benefit from advice on offering and promoting healthier products which will place them in a favoured position with public procurement agencies concerned with the healthy catering agenda.

Policy makers operating in a range of areas will benefit from the lessons learnt from the project regarding successful behaviour change strategies with the independent fast food sector and its supply chain. The project will help determine where such strategies can encourage voluntary agreement with the independent sector to be reached and where more stringent intervention is required if a real impact on health is to be achieved. 

The national remit and network of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) - a key partner in the project, will ensure that the resources developed and lessons learnt are disseminated to public health practitioners operating in central, local and regional government throughout the UK</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61942</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Video clips of case study businesses and healthier catering initiatives produced as part of a toolkit &amp;quot;Encouraging Healthier Catering in Low-income Communities&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3AD8FC6-9658-434E-9415-A323929FF251</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The videos are being used by local environmental health officers and other public health officials to promote healthier catering initiatives</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546242b12d1e40.87246922</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Video clips of best practice businesses and healthier catering initiatives</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ifsip.org/Takeaways_in_Deprived_Areas_Tookit.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Greater London Authority (GLA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>GLA: Work with Suppliers</gtr:description><gtr:id>27465F6B-EC7C-46AB-B7A7-A41BB5081DF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A major London Supplier has been persuaded to promote healthier options and alter their pricing strategy to encourage the purchase of these

Since the end of the project our partners have continued to work with this supplier (JJ Food Service) and others. JJs have launched a healthier products brochure and offer a 10% discount on these products to food outlets that have achieved the London Healthier Catering Committment (HCC) award. This is 'nudging' fast food outlets to purchase healthier products and sign up to the HCC. The initiative was launched at an event at City Hall attended by circa 75 people on 11th February.

The project has resulted in three key impacts: 

1) It has encouraged major suppliers to the independent fast food sector to make healthier products more accessible to their customers.

Our research identified that some of the barriers fast food operators face in adopting healthier practices are due to suppliers, who tend to charge more for healthier options and not promote them effectively. Following our intervention with one of the major suppliers to the sector (JJ Food Supplies) this supplier made a number of changes to its pricing and marketing policy to encourage the purchase of healthier options instead of the less healthy alternatives. This included promoting healthier rapeseed oil, healthy frying tips and pricing its own branded Julienne, 3/8 inch and steak cut chips at the same price. These promotions are still in place 12 months after our intervention. JJs has also now agreed to give discounts to businesses with the Healthier Catering Commitment (HCC) award when they purchase healthier options. 
A further supplier (Makro) has subsequently agreed that its healthier options can be branded with the HCC logo. These 'nudges' should encourage businesses to opt for the healthier choices.

2) It is contributing to the design of new local authority intervention strategies for working with the out of home food sector

The Encouraging Healthier Takeaways in Low-income Communities toolkit developed by the project has provided policy makers with an analysis of the different strategic approaches that can be adopted with independent businesses in the fast food sector. Prior to our research there was limited understanding of the barriers businesses face in adopting healthier catering practices. Many healthier catering inventions had had limited success with fast food outlets, particularly in more in deprived areas. As a result they were doing little to impact on the health of the most deprived communities or address health inequalities. Our project has particularly emphasised the need to understand the business perspective if interventions are to be effective. It has identified some of the changes that are viable in these contexts and the intervention strategies that are most likely to work. These include interventions which draw on behavioural insights and 'nudging' techniques and we have been able to demonstrate how these approaches show some promise but are often context specific and do not necessarily offer a cheaper alternative to other forms of intervention. The approaches we have outlined are being embraced by public health departments across the UK and are informing the design of new interventions (see below for details). 
As a result of the project's dissemination activities and the increasing profile of our work in this area we have been asked by two local authorities to work with them on developing new interventions. These includes a Stealthier Fast Food study for LB Tower Hamlets which is investigating the feasibility of fast food outlets adopting 'health by stealth' approaches to encourage healthier consumption by young people, and a contract for LB Hackney into the feasibility of local retail outlets adopting changes which might encourage the purchase of healthier food items. Both contracts are designed to develop a model which can be rolled out with businesses across the respective boroughs.

3) It has improved the effectiveness of public health staff who are working to promote healthier catering practices amongst local fast food businesses 

Fast food outlets in deprived areas offer some of the least healthy type of food and are also the hardest to engage in the healthier catering agenda. The toolkit developed by the project is novel in recognising the business barriers to change and in outlining ways in which these can be overcome and healthier practices adopted without compromising the profitability of the business. It sets out approaches (identified from the UK wide survey undertaken for the project) that can be effective in persuading such businesses to adopt healthier catering practices. These are supported by a set of best practice case studies and video clips that were requesting by public health practitioners during the design of the project and which provide practical real life examples that local businesses can identify with and follow. As a result of the project public health staff are better equipped to work with some of the most hard to reach and least healthy fast food businesses. 

HOW THE FINDINGS FROM THE PROJECT ARE BEING USED
 
The findings of the project are being used by public health policy makers, practitioners, fast food businesses and their suppliers.

The toolkit developed by the project has been widely promoted as good practice advice by a number of national and regional government bodies who feature and provide links to it on their website. For example the Department of Health has posted the toolkit on its Responsibility Deal website (https://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/new-toolkit-to-encourage-healthier-fast-food-in-low-income-areas-2/ ) alongside other advice on healthier catering tips that are promoted nationally. This has attracted 414 page views and 277 unique page views. The toolkit has also been posted on the website of the Greater London Authority, Wales NHS, and the Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH), the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, the Institute of Food Safety Integrity &amp;amp; Protection (TiFSiP) and the Healthy Places website. It has been highlighted in key national and regional reports including the Mayor of London's response to the London Health Commission (2014), The Good Food for London Report (2014), and the Royal Society for Public Health's report Health on the High Street (2015).

Active promotion of the toolkit and webinar via the project partners' networks and websites and at several dissemination events including the Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health in Nottingham, a meeting of the Association of London Environmental Health Officers in London, and at the toolkit launch at City Hall in London, has raised awareness of the research findings. Feedback from policy makers and practitioners suggests that the toolkit and the policy webinar are helping them reflect on issues that need to be considered when designing interventions to work with the fast food sector, particularly in deprived areas. It has promoted some boroughs which already have healthier catering initiatives to acknowledge that their schemes may need to be modified if they are to have an impact on these type of businesses. At least four local authorities, to date, have drawn on the toolkit when developing their own healthier catering schemes. For example Essex County Council has incorporated many of the strategies and behaviour change techniques that the toolkit suggests in its new Tuck in Toolkit and we were invited to speak at the launch of this. Wolverhampton City Council have, &amp;quot;taken into consideration the case studies and lessons learned,&amp;quot; and Stoke on Trent City Council have used it as a guide to promote their Healthy Eating Project. Slough Borough Council reported that it was planning to follow the guidance in the toolkit during a new pilot project with takeaways.

Feedback on the toolkit from over 20 local authorities from across the UK suggests that it is being actively used to support public health staff working with businesses to encourage healthier catering practices. Comments have included:
 &amp;quot;We are using it to demonstrate ways in which adopting a healthier menu would save the business money&amp;quot; (Kettering Borough Council).
&amp;quot;It contains some really helpful tips, and it's good to read about other schemes across the country too&amp;quot;. (London Borough of Bexley)
&amp;quot;It gives officers in the team ideas on how to encourage business uptake of healthier catering practices&amp;quot; (London Borough of Islington). 
&amp;quot;Hoping to run another workshop with local businesses and this time play some of your case studies to demonstrate that 'people like them' can successfully make changes without compromising taste, losing customers, little or minimal cost impact etc. &amp;quot; (London Borough of Haringey) 
&amp;quot; I plan to use them (the toolkits) at event days - such as our award ceremonies, training sessions and to those who enquire about our scheme here and 1-1 when I visit places that would benefit from a written book and also help direct them to the web site&amp;quot; (London Borough of Tower Hamlets)

The video clips of best practice case studies that are embedded within the toolkit have become a training resource in their own right and have been used at at least three events. This includes the launch of Essex County Council's new healthier catering scheme, a ceremony run by organisers of the Eat Out Eat Well (EOEW) scheme in Bath and N.E Somerset for businesses that had received the EOEW award, and at the Haringey's Healthy Schools meeting organised by the local Public Health Directorate. Feedback from these events suggests that the videos are seen as particularly valuable as they provide real life examples that businesses can relate to and they are more likely to adopt similar healthier practices as a result. 

CHALLENGES OVERCOME TO ACHIEVE IMPACT

Engaging with suppliers was particularly challenging. Initial difficulties in meeting the main London supplier to the independent fast food sector (JJ Food Supplies) were finally overcome by persuading the Mayor of London to intervene. 
Encouraging many of the least healthy fast food businesses in deprived areas to adopt healthier menus and catering practices still remains very challenging and time consuming. 

We have argued in our dissemination activities and our webinar that as well as intervention along the supply chain government intervention in the form of taxation for unhealthy products and/or subsidies for healthier ones may also be required for a greater impact on public health to be achieved.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>31375860-E6B6-47F1-96EA-FAF1BA3D8E3E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54ad60bea1bda1.65309059</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. SIGNIFICANT NEW KNOWLEDGE GENERATED includes identifying:
a) Key success factors for engaging fast food outlets in deprived areas in healthier catering initiatives. These include: 
i) focusing on a small number of manageable changes, 
ii) considering whether an award or a 'health by stealth' approach is more acceptable (in some areas promoting food as healthier is a 'turn-off'), 
iii) emphasising the business benefits (particularly potential cost savings) rather than the health benefits
iv) demonstrating customer demand 

b) Types of healthier changes that can realistically be introduced by these businesses and key variables that influence these: A limited number of Healthier 4Ps: products, pricing, promotional, and placing strategies - including a variety of nudging techniques, work in certain contexts. Key contextual variables are both internal (owner manager and staff motivation, skills, business resources and type of food sold) and external (nature and level of local competition, characteristics of customer base, supplier constraints). For example, acceptable healthier swaps may depend on the ethnicity of the customer base. Thus rice can be substituted for chips by businesses in areas with a high Asian and/or Afro-Caribbean population. The use of salt is affected by cultural practices regarding different food types - hiding salt in kebab shops is easy but impossible in fish and chip shops.

The research was able to highlight the need for a detailed understanding of the business and local context prior to the introduction of an intervention. 

c) A greater understanding of the complexity of the supply chain and how it affects businesses capacity for making healthier changes. For example the higher cost of healthier products and the provision of free fridges in return for them being stocked with their own branded (less healthy) drinks. Our original plans for work with suppliers were over optimistic; access to the one supplier we were able to engage with was only possible following intervention from the Mayor of London. This supplier was persuaded to promote healthier products more prominently on their website. However the research noted the constraints that suppliers also face (particularly lower demand and margins on healthier alternatives). Government intervention higher up the supply chain and in the form of more stringent regulation is required for a significant impact on obesity to be achieved. 

2. NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS include: 
? What can be learnt from transnational comparisons of effective behaviour change interventions in this field?
? How to bring economic development and healthier consumption together via local authority action research on health promoting job creation - particularly in light of the multi-valent significance of independent takeaways serving low income communities?
? The extent to which local authorities might be able to use their purchasing power to exert pressure on suppliers to offer healthier ingredients on more affordable terms? 

3. The project has developed NEW NETWORKS; most importantly with the FUSE centre (http://www.esrc.ac.uk/research/major-investments/fuse.aspx) involving collaboration on their Transforming the 'foodscape' study and a presentation at their network meeting. Links have been established with Shift and we plan to evaluate the future roll-out of their Box Chicken initiative ( http://www.shiftdesign.org.uk/products/healthy-fast-food/)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Public Health practitioners: The project findings and toolkit developed are being used by those encouraging fast food businesses to adopt healthier catering practices. The case studies are particularly popular as they provide real life role models. Those establishing new healthier catering schemes have found the toolkit useful as it outlines different strategies for engagement and the contextual variables that need to be considered.
Policy makers: The project has identified some viable healthier fast food business models, but also the barriers to change which we argue can only be overcome through government intervention, for example around the use of oil high in transfats, fizzy drinks and portion sizes. We have raised these issues with Public Health England at conferences and workshops and in our policy webinar. Our research fits in well with the revival of policy interest in interventions that adopt a whole systems approach to tackling obesity and we are currently engaged in tendering for studies in this area. 
Academic routes. The research has helped unpick the contextual factors which impact on the viability of behaviour change strategies and has contributed to debates on the effective regulation (voluntary, nudging, legislation) of SMEs.

This scheme encourages businesses to make a number of healthier changes to their menus and cooking practices.
