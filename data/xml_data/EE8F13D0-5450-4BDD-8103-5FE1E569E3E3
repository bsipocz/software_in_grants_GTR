In such a space one can measure the length of a vector by using a `norm', so generalizing the usual concept of the length of a vector in ordinary n-dimensional space . This leads to the axiomatic definition of a `normed linear space'; if our space has an additional `completeness' property, we obtain a `Banach space'.These spaces have been studied for about 70 years. They capture the fundamental mathematics behind many standard phenomena, including those of continuous linear transformations from one Banach space to another; the collection of these linear maps forms another Banach space. Standard examples of Banach spaces are those consisting of certain continuous functions and of spaces of functions that can be integrated, thus tying our theory with that of the calculus.The study of these spaces is called `functional analysis', a very significant strand in modern mathematics; it is now a standard course in, say, the final year of honours degree programmes in mathematics.A linear space may have another structure - that of taking the `product' of two elements to form an `algebra'. A Banach space which is an algebra and which is such that the product is continuous is called a `Banach algebra'. For example the space of all continuous linear transformations on a fixed Banach space is itself a Banach algebra in a natural way. Further the integrable functions on certain groups, such as the real line, form a Banach algebra for a natural `convolution' product.The notion of a multi-norm space was introduced by Dales and Polyakov. It generalizes that of a normed linear space E, which has one norm, by a taking a sequence of norms, one on each of the n-fold product spaces of E with itself. These multi-norms must satisfy certain axioms. They are a more sophisticated way of measuring the `length and shape' of a family of vectors.The first part of our project is to clarify and complete an existing account of multi-norm spaces, and submit it for publication.There is a similar generalization of a Banch algebra to a `multi-Banach algebra'. The second part of our project is to study this new notion. We believe that these ideas wil have significan applications to the study of continuous linear operators and of algebras on various locally compact groups.We plan to write an account of these multi-Banach algebras and their applications, to be submitted as a memoir.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work of Dales and Pham will have impact on other academic researchers. Hung Le Pham is a young researcher at the beginning of his career in mathematics; his interaction with strong mathematicians in the UK and his participation in this project will be of value to him at this crucial time of his career; his visit to Leeds is strongly supported by his Head of Department. The research will stimulate the teaching of Dales: he plans to give graduate lectures in Leeds in 2009-10 based on the theory on multi-norms, and it will inform the MMath module that he teaches on functional analysis at Leeds. The teaching of Pham in Wellington, New Zealand will also benefit, first at the level of graduate students, and then in a different form for undergraduate students. The research will lead to collaborative visits to each other's countries, and both Dales and Pham will be invited to a number of centres in foreign countries. This will increase the sense of collaboration between mathematicians world-wide. Pham will lecture at various centres in the UK during his stay. In New Zealand, Dales will visit several centres to lecture on advanced mathematics (in particular he has an invitation to lecture at the annual meeting of the New Zealand Mathematical Society). He will also give some popular lectures, including some to school children. Dales already has invitations to lecture in Canada, India, Iran, and Turkey on the topic of our research. This spreads appreciation of UK mathematics and, as a practical measure, may lead to applications from students in these countries to be graduate students in Leeds. We note that, when he visits these countries as a lecturer, Dales will participate in discussion with senior academics and university administrators on a variety of educational matters and connections between their countries and the UK. He also gives lectures (usually very well attended) to undergraduate students on suitable topics in mathematics and opportunities in the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16185</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H019405/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
