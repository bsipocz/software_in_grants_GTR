One consequence of societal multilingualism is the growing demand for Translation, Interpreting and Communication Support services within interactions between the general public and public sector bodies. Such services may be offered for exchanges involving a migrant language as well as English or when both of the relevant languages are indigenous (e.g. English and Gaelic in Scotland). The scale of the demand is most readily illustrated with the finding that over one hundred and fifty languages are used in combination with English in Public Service exchanges in Scotland alone.\n\nPublic Service Interpreting (PSI) research is gaining momentum against a background of political interest, in the UK and elsewhere, across the whole range of issues relating to social inclusion and equality of access to public services, in particular in connection with the movement of immigrants, economic migrants and asylum-seekers.\nThe focus of PSI research is therefore on face-to-face interaction in multilingual settings where individuals encounter the state (e.g. legal, health, education, housing, environmental health and social services), and therefore upon the work of public service interpreters as facilitators of communication between would-be interlocutors who do not share common linguistic ground. \n\nA common misperception about the role of interpreters is that linguistic structures are readily transferable between languages and therefore that interpreting is a very straightforward, non-technical task. A significant body of research and scholarship now attests to the opposite view: interpreting is actually highly complex and can impose an extremely demanding cognitive and emotional load. This is particularly true in high impact settings, such as police stations, where the interpreter-mediated exchanges may aim at making significant decisions related to individuals' credibility, freedom and future prospects.\n\nThe research will build on initial explorations into the seldom researched area of interpreter-mediated investigative interviews, with the dual aim of highlighting their specific challenges and identifying ways in which these may be addressed. \n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Policy-makers in the legal and interpreting professions will benefit from research aimed at identifying or adjusting codes of practice and procedures for the successful conduct of investigative interviews. The research will also inform Scottish Government policies as they relate, for example, to the mainstreaming of diversity and social inclusion. \n\nThe research will benefit public sector bodies, including police forces and authorities as well as CILT- The National languages Centre (both Scotland and UK), by making a positive contribution to the design of specialist training programmes and national standards in interpreting respectively.\n\nThe research will directly inform the work of European organisations such as EULITA (European Association of Legal Interpreters and Translators) or SIGTIPS (Special Interest Group of the European Language Council on Translation and Interpreting for the Public Services) given that the principal investigator is an active member of these organisations.\n\nCommercial agencies providing public sector bodies with translation, interpreting and communication support services will be able to use the research results in order to enhance the quality of provision and inform the bids they submit in response to procurement tenders e.g. issued by police forces.\n\nThe main Scotland and UK professional organisations for legal interpreters and translators (e.g. Chartered Institute of Linguists, SITA (Scottish Interperters and Translators Association), ITI (Institute for Translation and Interpreting) Scotland and UK) as well as other Scotland-wide organisations such as 'Happy to Translate' or the Scottish Consumer Council - reaching both public and private sector stakeholders - \nwill be able to use the results of the research in order to actively promote and disseminate best practice among their members.\n\nThe research will contribute to ensuring that public service users gain better and fairer access to services (in particular but not only police services) and public service providers are better equipped to comply with diversity and access policy requirements.\n\nBoth interpreter and police training institutions will benefit directly from some of the outputs of the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37672</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>St Johns Hospital at Howden, Livingston</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Interpreting in Mental Health care settings</gtr:description><gtr:id>E1B73435-F492-4444-9691-7D4D4D3D4A3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs planned for 2015.
