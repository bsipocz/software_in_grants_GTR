The engineer of tomorrow may be just as likely to be working with human tissues and cells, as with steel or concrete. Medical Engineering is attracting an impressive range of new, talented individuals who see that many of the latest bio-medical research topics have engineering problems at their heart.At Keele University, the Research Institute for Science &amp;amp; Technology in Medicine (ISTM) was established in 2004 to bridge the gap between new advances in basic science and technology with medicine and clinical practice. Basic scientists and engineers have different methods of working, terminology and professional cultures to those working in the medical professions. There are often difficulties in linking clinicians to areas of science and technology that can help them to understand, diagnose and treat diseases. There are also difficulties in linking basic science projects to relevant areas of clinical need. Those difficulties are mainly through using different terms, lack of space and lack of time to meet. ISTM at Keele has successfully linked many basic scientists to clinicians by taking a bench to bedside approach. But ISTM has identified two further areas of expertise within the University that would help to advance several of its ongoing projects, especially in areas such as growing replacement human tissues in the laboratory through Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Engineering.1. Keele's Mathematical Modelling Group employ mathematical modelling techniques to solve problems in industrial processes, biology and human physiology. This group has an international profile and is increasingly interested in applying its expertise to exciting new areas like stem cells and cell engineering.2. Keele's Applied and Environmental Geophysics Research Group uses ultra-high resolution geophysical techniques and numerical modelling to study features of geology, especially oil reserves, archaeology and other aspects of the environment. The group's expertise covers fuel cells, clean energy, biomass utilisation, pollution control, waste management, green chemistry, clean and innovative utilisation of coal, involving academic and commercial links throughout the world. The expertise they have in creating images of features and spaces in the earth can equally well be applied to human bodies.Together these scientists and clinicians have decided to form the Modelling Methods for Medical Engineering (3ME) Initiative to try to encourage working together, enabling new ways of thinking about some of the problems that have been encountered in trying to develop medical engineering technologies. Four Professors are leading the Initiative: Prof Alicia El Haj and Prof Jon Dobson from the Medical Engineering side, Prof Graham Rogerson from Mathemtical Modelling and Prof Peter Styles from Geophysics. They each lead research groups involving other professors, lecturers, research assistants and research students, and so there are about 30-40 staff at Keele who are interested to be involved in the 3ME Initiative. There are several ways to forge new links between those groups:1. Speed Dating and Pairing introducing young lecturers to each others research.2. Researcher in Residence scheme in which staff swap roles to immerse themselves in a new research culture. They will present lectures and other sessions to colleagues and students.3. Problem Scoping Workshops identifying a series of complex problems of mutual interest and defining approaches to tackle them.4. Sandpit meetings in which 30 selected participants discuss ideas intensively for two days, and the best idea receives around 25,000 support to help develop it and carry out some first experiments. There will be two of these.5. Back-to-Back Seminars : several pairs of 40 minute seminars, one after the other.6. Visiting Senior Research Fellows who will visit from other universities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282810</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>11000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Loan of &amp;pound;11,000 'Phyback' Impulse electrotherapy system</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Impulse Medical Systems Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>AAD13E48-92D4-4054-A9A0-7FE15E82FDA1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d704fe5a7e17.54044534</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>50000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>3ME Initiative - Modelling Methods for Medical Engineering</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/J501591/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>8FACAC08-DB73-4C20-949B-24AF8BE79DA5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d718c74739d2.86197801</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Discussions with software and imaging companies regarding innovations resulting from this grant</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DDDDD828-6789-443B-8714-8A96729A61AA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56def4b8bc6117.75717855</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Responses made to a Bridging the Gaps questionnaire in July 2020 by Keele University's ProVC for Research 7 Enterprise:

Name: Professor Peter Jones, Pro VC Research &amp;amp; Enterprise, Keele University

1. To what extent are you aware of the Bridging the Gaps programme, and how has this awareness come about?

The Bridging the Gap programme at Keele is known as the 3ME Initiative (Modelling Methods for Medical Engineering) and has enjoyed a high profile since the EPSRC grant was first awarded in 2007-08. Indeed the initial collaboration between medical engineers and mathematicians, on which it was partly based, was first discussed a year before the application was made. The involvement of the geophysicists came about as a result of Keele's plans for submission to RAE2008, in which as Pro-VC I took the lead role. Hence I have been aware of the Bridging the Gaps Programme from well before the application was made to the EPSRC for significant funds to support it.


2. What impact has the Bridging the Gaps award had on other academics within the same department, related discipline, and across the University? (Please try to give specific examples)

Through its wide range of dual-honours degrees, Keele has nearly sixty years of experience in crossing traditional discipline boundaries. In 2004 the University took the radical decision to restructure its research into seven Research Institutes that deliberately ignore any such boundaries. Within that new structure, the University has been keen to avoid the possible &amp;quot;silo effects&amp;quot; of Research Institutes. Keele has wanted to continue to nurture research collaborations that produce novel and diverse approaches to complex research problems. The 3ME Initiative has certainly achieved that objective and has become a shorthand phrase in the University for activities that bring disparate groups together. I have not personally attended any of its residential events but they have achieved a high profile within the University and led to all the academic staff who have even a remote connection with 3ME's aims to get involved in its activities. Perhaps the hardest group to attract has been our clinical colleagues in the University Hospital and nearby orthopaedic hospital, whose role is vital to ensure the medical relevance of the projects that were put forward to the 3ME Initiative. But I am pleased to say that all the 3ME Initiative residential activities and many of its seminars can report clinician attendance and involvement, and this has to be good for developing Keele's translational research in biomedical engineering.

3. Are you aware of success(es) directly attributable to the Bridging the Gaps funding? And if yes, has this success led to further leverage of Cross Discipline Research? (Please try to give specific examples)

So far, the 3ME Initiative has directly supported ten projects as a result of its Sandpit meetings and it is true to say that almost all of those would not have occurred without the collaborative opportunities it offered. Each example crosses not just Research Institute and traditional discipline boundaries, but also other less visible barriers to research: culture (medics and non-medics interacting), age (teams comprising very senior and very junior staff), geography (researchers in labs up to 30 miles apart), language (a forum for the thorough explanation of discipline-specific terms) and time (the ability to meet and talk in a relaxed atmosphere but driven by specific objectives and incentives). 
As an example, the question session after one &amp;quot;Back-to-Back&amp;quot; seminar in October 2009 focussing on Methane gas and its role in medical diagnostics produced four clear leads for interdisciplinary research projects, all of which are under active consideration.

4. What impact has the Bridging the Gaps programme had on your University strategy? Do the research areas in which they fall influence your University's roadmap for future strategic investment? 

The field supported by the 3ME Initiative is important for one of Keele's two University-wide themes in its Strategic Map 2010-15: Ageing. Medical engineering, especially in stem cell and other tissue engineering, is a key technology to allow an ageing population to enjoy the maximum benefits of mobility and general health. Keele has invested heavily in its medical research capability, in parallel with its undergraduate Medical School, and the 3ME Initiative has allowed so really novel ideas to emerge to keep the University at the cutting edge of medical engineering.

5. Has any extra support been provided by the institution that goes beyond the normal level of support to the grant holders to achieve the specific objectives of the call, If yes, how often? And in what way through the specific scheme enablers of 
? Flexibility to pursue their strategic direction 
? Exploration of speculative research directions 
? Freedom for key groups to worked responsively and proactively 
? Encourage academics to pursue research supported by this award that is not normally available 
? Allow world leading groups to retain key expertise and development of researchers 

The 3ME Initiative is still ongoing and we have seen that in particular its &amp;quot;Researcher in Residence&amp;quot; scheme has enabled key staff to have high-quality time to pursue their personal research ideas and speculative research. The pump-priming funds offered by the Sandpit meetings have encouraged an innovative and competitive spirit which has brought forward some very unusual small teams and projects. Some will fail, others will succeed, and it is hoped that at Research Institute level the University will be able to support those which show most promise. 

6. Has the University made available any resources to support the development of ideas arising from the Bridging the Gaps award?

The University has supported the 3ME Initiative primarily through the lead Research Institute, Science &amp;amp; Technology in Medicine, in provision of extra support and co-ordination resources.

7. Have the Bridging the Gap Grant holders kept you (in your role as Pro Vice Chancellor) informed of specific opportunities to exploit the programme objectives in ways that would not have been feasible with a standard research grant? If yes, how often? And in what way? (Please try to give specific example against each of the scheme objectives which are given above). 

I am a member of one of the participating Research Institutes so I have been well informed of all the 3ME Initiative activities through that role. There has been virtually no overlap between what the 3ME Initiative has offered and what could be achieved under a standard research grant, with the possible exception of the visiting overseas researchers.

8. Has the Bridging the Gaps Grant funding made the University 'more visible' externally? E.g. other universities, related research fields or the general public? (Can you give examples where this has happened; not traditional academic papers or presentations) 

Yes, although some of the activities on public understanding of science arising from the 3ME Initiative have yet to take place.


9. Would you be interested in getting involved in similar schemes if the opportunity became available? 

Yes.


10. Are there any other points that you would like to raise in relation to the Bridging the Gaps scheme that have not be covered above? 

The 3ME Initiative has been able to draw upon mutual support from the other bridging the Gaps grant co-ordinators at other universities and this has been particularly valuable in planning Keele's own programme of effective activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The field supported by the &amp;quot;3ME Initiative&amp;quot; is important for one of Keele's two University-wide themes in its Strategic Map 2010-15: Ageing.
