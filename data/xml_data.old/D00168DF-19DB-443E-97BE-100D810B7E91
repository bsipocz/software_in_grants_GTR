However, research has shown that such work is often precarious and that the cultural sector is marked by increasing inequalities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to add to our understanding of cultural work by conducting qualitative research on young, female classical musicians in Berlin and London. In doing so, the study addresses gaps in existing research that relate to the working lives of classical musicians, and the ways in which cultural work is affected by gender and its urban context.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Furthermore, the research draws on an innovative theoretical framework that links cultural work to the category ?young woman? through the notion of entrepreneurialism. Recent research has demonstrated that entrepreneurialism, as an ethos to work on and improve the self, is prevalent amongst cultural workers and young women. By focusing on early-career female musicians, the project will explore the experiences of individuals who may be the quintessence of entrepreneurialism, thereby illuminating how entrepreneurialism is registered and lived out.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study will benefit the following users in Germany and Britain: 

1. Academics and researchers 
The study adds to our understanding of the classical music world and some of its gendered, racialised and classed dynamics. In addition, the research offers an original analytical framework by putting into dialogue studies of cultural work with cutting-edge feminist research on the status of young women in contemporary Western societies. The focus on experiences of entrepreneurial selfhood contributes to analyses of entrepreneurialism in cultural work and beyond. Lastly, the research's comparative perspective puts cultural work into its urban setting. The project will thus benefit academics and researchers interested in various issues, such as the classical music profession; gender, cultural work and entrepreneurialism; and cultural work in its urban context. 

2. Policy-makers 
The cultural industries - which include sectors ranging from film, music, TV and radio - have been subject to growing policy interest in recent years. Identified as a key growth sector, the cultural industries have been promoted in a range of countries, as is evidenced by government-run initiatives, such as the Creative Industries Council in the UK, and 'Initiative Kultur- und Kreativwirtschaft der Bundesregierung' in Germany. This project's focus on cultural work caters to policy-makers' interest in the cultural industries. The dissemination activities will ensure that the study's findings are communicated to policy-makers in Germany and Britain (Greater London Authority; Senate of Berlin; DCMS; German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology). 

3. Interest groups, unions and cultural sector organisations 
The project will offer valuable knowledge on the classical music profession, entrepreneurialism and cultural work. The focus on gender, and related issues of race and class, will be of particular interest. While the cultural industries tend to be regarded as egalitarian, the cultural sector is characterised by a substantial lack of workforce diversity in terms of gender, race, class and ability. Cultural sector employers, cultural organisations, campaigning groups, trade unions and charities will benefit from learning about the processes involved in accessing and advancing in the cultural industries and how certain groups may face particular challenges in doing so. Commissioned research and initiatives by unions, funding councils and cultural sector organisations (Musician's Union; HEFCE; Ver.di; Deutscher Musikrat; Deutscher Kulturrat) demonstrate a great interest in these issues in Germany and Britain. 

4. Musicians, artists and creatives 
While the study explores the working lives of classical musicians, its focus on entrepreneurialism, gender, and cultural work will speak to a wider range of artists and creatives in London and Berlin. The project will be of interest to cultural workers because it offers an empirically based, critical and contextualised understanding of entrepreneurialism and creatives' working lives. In addition, the project's focus on structural inequalities in the creative industries will benefit cultural workers by enhancing their understanding of barriers to entry and career advancement, and ways of addressing these. 

5. Media and wider public 
The project will explore cultural work, entrepreneurialism, and gender relations in contemporary Western societies with the aim of increasing public awareness and contributing to an informed media and public debate. Through in-depth qualitative research, the project seeks to refine commonly held assumptions about the relationship between entrepreneurialism and creativity; equality in the creative industries; and cultural work in different urban settings. The various dissemination activities, such as the project website, use of social media, and roundtables will provide ample opportunity to engage a wider audience in the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102299</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>London Music Masters (Talk)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F0A62E34-ACD4-44FC-8AC9-1BCFC950BDA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2 Dec 2014: London Music Masters. &amp;quot;Race, class and classical music: Education isn't enough&amp;quot;.

Creative work, such as the work of musicians, is often described as work that you can't help doing. Indeed, many musicians love playing music and experience the ability to pursue their passion as a great privilege. In addition, most musicians are freelancers and therefore enjoy comparatively autonomous and flexible working lives. Their work is also characterised by a lot of variety, which relates to the kind of music played, the different contexts (e.g. performance, teaching, or outreach), and the collaborative nature of the work. Flow moments, or what has been described as being in the zone are experienced as particularly pleasurable and fulfilling.

However, the perks of the profession come at a cost. As a report by the Musicians Union (2012) has demonstrated, many musicians have portfolio careers, which are marked by low incomes (less than &amp;pound;20.000 a year for 56% of those surveyed), uncertainty, and lack of workplace benefits such as pensions. Only 10% of surveyed musicians were full-time salaried employees, half reported not having regular employment whatsoever, and 60% stated that they had worked for free in the past 12 months. Given the high rate of playing related injuries amongst musicians (Help Musicians UK, 2014), the relative lack of social security is worrying, particularly for freelancers. Whilst the profession offers some autonomy, flexibility and the pursuit of creative fulfilment, it also bears risk and difficulties.

2) Entrepreneurialism

Many musicians are wholly or partly self-employed and hold multiple jobs, ranging from teaching to performing. In such an environment, it is important to pursue employment opportunities actively through networking and self-promotion. Indeed, researchers and career advisors have argued that entrepreneurial skills are increasingly important to succeed in the industry. 'Young, female and entrepreneurial?' both supports and problematises this argument. While entrepreneurial skills may be important, they are not necessarily evenly distributed. As my paper 'Blowing your own trumpet: exploring the gendered dynamics of self-promotion' demonstrates, self-promotion is a gendered practice. The advice 'just sell yourself' may pose particular challenges to women. And, crucially, the call to be entrepreneurial does not address underlying and wider issues such as the oversupply of well-trained musicians and the lack of jobs and employment opportunities.

Indeed, entrepreneurialism is widely discussed in the academic literature and from many different perspectives. This project takes a broadly sociological approach to entrepreneurialism, which argues that individuals increasingly relate to themselves as if they were enterprises. This means that the logic of enterprise has been extended beyond the economic sphere to all spheres of life including friendships, work, relationships, and the body. Musicians, for example, frequently talk about themselves and their work as a business or product that has to be marketed successfully. But what does it mean when we refer to our selves as a business? And how is the expectation to relate to oneself as a business experienced? I recently explored these questions in a blog entry for the journal Theory, Culture &amp;amp; Society, available here: http://www.theoryculturesociety.org/christina-scharff-on-gender-and-neoliberalism/

3) Equality and diversity

While some progress has been made, female musicians continue to face a range of challenges. Women have outnumbered men at conservatoires for a long time and yet, they remain under-represented in the workforce. Existing research suggests that around 40% of players in British orchestras are female, but that the representation of women is lower in more prestigious orchestras. In Germany, the female membership in orchestras is currently around 30% (DOV, 2014). Women also face vertical and horizontal segregation. This means that they are less represented in positions of authority, such as conducting, and concentrated in other sectors of the profession, such as teaching. There is also a gender pay gap. In the music industry as a whole, men earn &amp;pound;7.92 per hour while women's hourly pay is &amp;pound;6.92 (Creative and Cultural Skills, 2010). Germany has an insurance scheme for freelance artists, which includes musicians. And the latest numbers are sobering. Women musicians make 22% less than their male counterparts (Deutscher Kulturrat, 2013). The parts of the industry where pay is highest are conducting and composing, which are both male-dominated fields.

These gender inequalities cut across class and racial inequalities. A recent report (ABRSM, 2014) on music education has shown that children from lower socio-economic groups continue to be disadvantaged. As Anna Bull has explained, the middle-class history and culture of music education remains a significant barrier to participate in music training. This may lead to under-representation of musicians from less privileged socio-economic backgrounds. And in relation to research on the ethnic backgrounds of musicians, a report on the entire music sector by Creative Blueprint has shown that 93% of the industry was white in 2011, which was not representative of the UK population. Further research is needed to explore the demographic makeup of the classical music workforce in Germany and the UK in relation to gender, racial and class background. To find out more, please consult my research report here: https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/young-female-and-entrepreneurial/

Classical music is not the only sector that continues to be marked by inequalities. Women and ethnic minorities are also under-represented in other cultural and creative industries (Creative Skillset, 2012). As recent academic research has demonstrated, informal work settings, flexibility and reliance on networks tend to make it more difficult for women and workers from minority-ethnic as well as working-class backgrounds to advance in creative careers. These trends throw into question commonly made claims about the importance of skill and talent, rather than demographic background. The fact that inequalities are on going and not a thing of the past highlights the need for research on equality and diversity in the cultural and creative industries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research report, for example, has garnered wide interest and I have been interviewed about the findings twice by BBC Radio 3 and once by BBC Radio 4.
