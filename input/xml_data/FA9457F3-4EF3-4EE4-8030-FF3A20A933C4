Uncontrolled vegetation fires cause severe environmental damage and economic and social disruption when weather conditions are right, as in spring 2011. Wildfires are costly and dangerous to fight. Impacts on ecosystem services are poorly understood by practitioners. Accessible knowledge is needed at all stages of the hazard chain from prevention, preparedness, detection and suppression to restoration. Much potentially relevant NERC and ESRC-funded science exists, but little is currently applied to the UK.
The fellowship will facilitate the uptake of NERC research to improve the management of wildfire risk in the UK. Building on momentum from the FIRES seminar series and work with user fora, the fellow will be a knowledge broker between NERC researchers, practitioners and policy-makers, joining up poorly-connected sectors. A staged approach will; promote existing research; identify operational and policy barriers and opportunities, and adapt outputs; and broker new research partnerships.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CFOA/EWWF/FRS/DCLG; spatial analysis of IRS data</gtr:description><gtr:id>2AD2D247-D3BC-449D-A510-BE2381FA3B7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>IRS-based criteria used to define wildfire in Scottish Government Fire Service Wildfire Operational Guidance (2013) http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/10/6118.

Their summary of the expert reports report took on board recommendations from my own report, including: (i) the need for fire risk management plans as a priority (HPMVP consultation draft, 2012, p20); (ii) the importance of rewetting restoration to improve ecosystem resilience to wildfire; and (iii) the role of prescribed burning in fuel management, despite NT's (still contentious) goal of phasing out prescribed burning in the High Peak estate: 
'We're keen to continue the ambitious programme of work to rewet and revegetate the bog to make it a better carbon store, better for water quality, better for wildlife and more resilient to wildfire. Burning will be removed from blanket bog, where it is thought to be damaging, unless it is required for fire risk management (National Trust, HPMVP, Consultation Draft, 2012, p4)
NT's final report (2013, p11) recognised the importance of managing wildfire risk: 'As we shift away from traditional heather management we'll make reducing the risk of wildfire a key focus of our work'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1c8dc480ee0.91429354-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provision of maps of the High Peak Estate and location of fires.

We used a GIS-based approach known as Multi-Criteria Evaluation, guided by two stakeholder workshops to solicit expert opinion. Participating organisations included the Forestry Commission, the Crown Estates, Ministry of Defence, HM Highways Services, Natural England, Heathland Conservation Society, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service, Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service, and Bracknell Forest Council.

The evaluation forms suggest that we were raising awareness of a new audience, notably emergency planners and development planners. Ten key points were developed from the practitioner panel and audience discussion in the afternoon, and were later presented to a wider audience at the Wildfire 2015 conference in Glasgow in November 2015.

Its aim is to communicate good practice in wildfire management from the UK and overseas (e.g. USA, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Eire). It attracts fire professionals, other practitioners and policy people from many different sectors, as well as established and early career researchers. 
 I organised a poster session at both conferences, having introduced one at the 2011 conference. I prioritise early career researchers and offer small bursaries in return for presenting a poster and writing a short reflective report on the experience. Being on the organising committee has allowed me to widen the number and range of contributions from researchers and to negotiate a reduced fee for presenters to make the event accessible to academics. My aim is engage more academics and especially to build capacity for future KE by involving early career researchers.
 At the 2013 conference, I presented a paper on my NERC KE Fellowship activities and mentored one of my MSc students to present a poster on his GIS analysis of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service's fire statistics. His poster attracted very positive discussion and he has since produced a user-facing report for GMFRS.
 At the 2015 conference, I was involved in eight different papers: (i) Co-presented an oral paper with CFOA and Forestry Commission England on our mapping work. This lead to an invitation from the Irish Dept of Agriculture and Forestry and the Mountain of Mourne Heritage Trust to participate in a cross-border workshop on best wildfire geolocation and mapping in Dundalk in March 2016. (ii) Helped to run a workshop on stakeholder priorities for wildfire management in the rural-urban interface (linked to the NERC PURE Associated project on wildfire threat analysis with the Forestry Commission England). The top 3 priorities will be presented at the England and Wales Wildfire and Scottish Wildfire Forums as a mandate from the wildfire community in negotiations with Government. (iii) Mentored 3 MSc students to present posters of their dissertation work, levering funding from the School towards their costs. The posters will be available online from the KfWf website. They received a lot of interest and helpful feedback. One student was invited to present his work a meeting of a new Fire Group in Lancashire, with a view to developing collaborative work. (iv) We presented a poster to launch the online 'Who does What' database and interactive map of UK vegetation fire researchers, developed with NERC-IAA funding as a signposting resource for he England and Wales Wildfire Forum. Again, the feedback from both practitioners and researchers was very encouraging. (v) Co-authored a poster and paper with Manchester colleagues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0b4cee7c769.40563908</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.firescotland.gov.uk/your-safety/wildfires/2015-uk-wildfire-conference-presentations.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>|Lancashire Fire Operations group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF8AD3E2-59FD-4056-B32C-C34D45D32184</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service to present a talk on mapping fire risk at the set-up meeting of the Lancashire Fire Operations group.

He was able to use the work as a case study for his MSc dissertation. He now works for an environmental consultancy and has said that the experience he gained was a strong factor in getting the job. The Fire Group are keen to set up more student projects. 

I was invited to be part of the Lancashire Fire group and have attended training exercises with them. I also took part in a short live news broadcast for radio Lancashire during one of these exercises. I still receive the agenda and attend when I can. 

The contacts made with members have widened the KfWf network, as the group members include planners, DEFRA, Natural England, RSPB, United Utilities, Bolton Mountain Rescue, Morecambe Bay Search and Rescue, Peel Energy (wind farms) and Wildlife Trusts.

As a result of evidence provided by myself and other members of EWWF, severe wildfire was recognised on the 2012 Olympic Risk Register and, in 2013, it was included for the first time on the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies (section 2.3, p8)[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/211867/NationalRiskRegister2013_amended.pdf].

Working with EWWF and the Chief Fire Officers' Association (CFOA) Wildfire Group on spatial analysis of Fire Service Incident Recording System (IRS), we devised the first working definition of significant wildfire from national fire statistics. It was used in the Scottish Government's Operational Fire Service Guidance on Wildfire (2013, section 3.4, p11) [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/10/6118]. I also reviewed chapters for this manual.

The Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat and the Department for Communities and Local Government's Resilience and Emergencies Directorate have included me on their Special Advisory of Group of Experts (SAGE). I would be co-opted to provide advice to Government in the event of a wildfire emergency and contribute to the National Risk Assessments, which review all risks on the National Risk Register. I have provided evidence on likelihood and impacts of severe wildfire.

Through my role on EWWF, I have contributed to Government consultations, including the Climate Change Risk Assessment 2012 and the National Adaptation Plan in 2014. I reviewed chapters for the Scottish Government's Operational Fire Service Guidance on Wildfire (2013, cited above), and currently for the Wildfire Prevention Manual, the equivalent being produced for England by CFOA.

As a member of the Fire and Rescue Statistics User Group (FRSUG), currently based within the Department for Communities and Local Government, I contribute evidence to Government consultations on how national IRS fire statistics can be used to quantify wildfire risk and recommendations for change. In 2013, CFOA used evidence from my analysis of IRS data for the 2011 spring wildfires in England in their submission on functionality and data fields for 'The Future of IRS'. For the 2016 call on Record-level Analysis of IRS, I submitted evidence to show how UK researchers could use IRS data for spatial and temporal analysis of wildfire risk. FRSUG wish to see wider use of IRS once it is a publically available data set, but have an acknowledged Fire Service and structural fire focus, so I aim to provide a voice for UK wildfire researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>39A43B04-781E-4E73-9BD4-EBC39B5F1D5A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461258b1c41d1.46320516</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As a NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellow, my findings are not empirical, but relate to the process of engagement between researchers and stakeholders, and how this generates impact. I work with the Fire Service, land managers and government departments dealing with UK wildfire to promote uptake of NERC-funded research and facilitate new projects. 

 I have developed excellent working relationships with the fire and land management sectors. A major achievement of the Fellowship has been in helping to build a community of practice between NERC researchers, wildfire management practitioners and policy-makers. This has been achieved through organising workshops, meetings, participating in national and local forums, and carrying out projects with stakeholders. The process has not been linear, nor has it been a one-way transfer of knowledge. A good policy brief opened doors to other networks and enabled me to become a member of national stakeholder forums and advisory groups. 

 It has been a two-way, learning process with many feedback loops. It requires time to build up trust, and a willingness to understand the operational context within which research findings must fit. I have learnt a huge amount from attending local Fire Group meetings and field training exercises, and by contributing to national forums and practitioner conferences. 

 The Fellowship has helped build capacity for early career researchers to carry on the work; notably the success of the EnviroSAR project in winning European funding to develop the UK's first wildfire mapping system.

 Wildfire management and policy in the UK has evolved as a bottom-up process. Wildfire is a truly cross-sector issue, which is hard to address at national level. The Fellowship has helped join up groups and has raise awareness of wildfire as a cross-cutting issue at all phases of the hazard chain, from land management as a prevention to preparedness, response and recovery. In particular, it has helped recognition that wildfire is not just a Fire Service issue, but also a land management one, especially when planning for climate change. DEFRA now require applicants for agri-support to assess wildfire risk on their land.

 Cooperation across sectors evolved ad hoc within local fire groups and later in national stakeholder forums. Being part of this process has been a very rewarding experience, and has resulted in a paper for the Royal Society co-produced with Forestry Commission England. 

 A significant measure of success has been the inclusion of severe wildfire in the National Risk Assessment and the public version -- the National Risk Register in 2013 and again in 2015. We await the results of the 2017 assessment.

 A more controversial international lesson to convey has been that vegetation fire can also have beneficial effects; that suppressing all fires in the absence of other management can lead to more severe fires. Wildfire risk needs to be reduced by managing the land to prevent build up of vegetation which fuels fire, for instance by grazing, cutting or prescribed burning. Since people cause most fires, public access also needs to be restricted at times of high fire risk. Both strategies can be controversial, since they affect other land uses such as agriculture, recreation and housing development. Nevertheless, wildfire risk management needs to be included as a valid ecosystem service alongside flood risk management. Our three recent publications (Davies et al. (2016 a, b, c*) have stimulated academic and stakeholder debate on the role of prescribed fire and its relationship to wildfire in the UK.

Three criteria use the Fire Service's Incident Recording System (IRS): a vegetation fire involving a geographical area of 1 hectare or greater; or requiring a committed resource of 4 or more fire appliances; or requiring resources to be committed for 6 or more hours. These three are based on a pilot project I did with the Chief Fire Officers Association and the England and Wales Wildfire Forum, in which we analysed 19 days of IRS statistics on vegetation fires for England from spring 2011. The aim was to evaluate the suitability of IRS for mapping wildfire regime, but we first had to develop a definition of significant wildfire to differentiate it from other vegetation fires (since technically a wildfire in the UK is 'any unplanned or unwanted vegetation fire which requires a decision or action on suppression'). The definition was developed in consultation with fire officers and allows for regional variations in resources and strategies. It was subsequently used in the Scottish manual and has therefore determined the way in which significant wildfire has been recorded by Scottish Fire and Rescue Services since 2013. It provides a nationally consistent way to evidence the likelihood and distribution of what have come to be known as 'Scottish manual wildfires'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e032a4db49e9.89963264</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/10/6118</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>National Risk Assessment 2015 and 2017</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E05DA21F-1777-4CE6-91DE-45F3E4A1AA46</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Severe wildfires were first included as a significant risk in the 2013 National Risk Assessment (NRA). It was included again in the 2015 NRA and sections 2.60 - 2.69 of its public version, the National Risk Register (NRR). Risk rating has changed since 2013 to reflect work undertaken to better understand the risk, largely by Forestry Commission England and other members of the England and Wales Wildfire Forum, including myself. Results of the current NRA are expected in July 2017.

Inclusion of 'severe wildfire' in the 2015 NRA means that risk Local Resilience Forums must consider wildfires in their Community Risk Registers, so risk assessment of severe wildfire will reinforced at a regional level. This increased awareness is encouraging more efficient and effective public service delivery of wildfire risk management by Fire and Rescue Services and other Category I emergency responders through their statutory role as members of Local Resilience Forums. The Fire and Rescue Services provide the initial regional risk assessment of 'severe wildfire' and the eariler companion risk, 'Forest and moorland fires' for their Local Resilience Forum. In a 2015 survey conducted by the Chief Fire Officers Association Wildfire Group of the 54 Fire and Rescue Services in the UK, Channel Islands and Isle of Man, two-thirds (36) said that their Community Risk Register included wildfire, and 52% had considered it in either their Integrated Risk Management Plans or their IRMP local area service plans.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1646c98ca83.10977179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-risk-register-of-civil-emergencies</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>National Risk Register</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C1CFCB6-E54A-4AEB-9DC0-35108BF58583</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved awareness of severe wildfire risk, with corresponding assessment of and emergency planning for that risk in the region by: (a) Local Resilience Forums in their Community Risk Registers; (b) Fire and Rescue Services in their Integrated Risk Management Plans.

They wish to see wider use of IRS as a publically-available data set, but have an acknowledged Fire Service and structural fire focus. Yet half the fires which Fire Services attend (excluding false alarms) are outdoor (77,000 in financial year 2012-13) and are mostly vegetation fires, 4,600 of which were 'large'. In 2011-12, Fire Services attended almost four times more vegetation fire incidents than flooding, although the impacts of flooding are greater.

As a member of FRSUG, I communicate the needs of NERC researchers, Fire Services, and Government agencies on how wildfire is recorded within the Fire Services' Incident Recording System (IRS), and how this geo-referenced dataset can then be used for spatial and temporal analysis of fire regime over time. This has included taking part in official consultations on IRS and using it to evidence wildfire for the National Risk Assessment and its public-facing version, the National Risk Register (see NRR entry). My role has been to provide a voice for NERC and other wildfire researchers who wish to use IRS to quantify wildfire risk. IRS will soon become a publically-available dataset, so impacts on wider research will start to become apparent. However, the record-level data required for this research may be generalised to comply with statutory data protection. In the 2016 consultation on Record-level Analysis of IRS, I submitted evidence to show how UK researchers are starting to use IRS data for spatial and temporal analysis of wildfire risk and why this is of value to Fire and Rescue Services and DEFRA agencies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e03c87bd4d77.66044033</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.frsug.org/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A &amp;quot;Who does What' database of 75 UK and Irish-based fire researchers and interactive map was produced with funding from Manchester's NERC Impact Accelerator Account.

It is based on published research I carried out with colleagues at Manchester so I advised MFF and the software developers. The interactive tool combines our spatial and temporal models; a GIS fire risk map shows where risk is highest, and a fire forecast model shows how this changes over time with the weather. Wildfire research and management have developed hand-in-hand in the Peak District - the unique wildfire database maintained by the Peak District Fire Operations Group since 1976 was the starting point for both the mapping and forecasting research. The forecast model is driven by live data from a weather station at Edale's Moorland Centre, where the resource is installed. Visitors can see when and where the risk of moorland fires is highest. It also allows them to explore fire risk history across the moors back as far as 2003. The too; was funded as part of the European Union MoorLIFE project. Following the press release and news item on the KfWf website, I was invited to co-write an article with MFF for Fire Times, a widely-circulated publication for fire professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:id>232D9FF9-0A8F-45A7-8D2F-01C6E9CDA35B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Speaking for Moors for the Future Partnership, Debra Wilson said; &amp;quot;This real-time educational tool is the first of its kind in the UK in combining weather and geographical data to give an immediate picture of the relative fire risk across the moors.

Gail used her research to develop a proposal called EnviroSAR, which won the Copernicus Sustainable Living Challenge 2016 for its commercial potential to be the UK's first wildfire mapping tool. The team were also runners-up of the overall Copernicus European-wide competition. KfWf supported the team by helping to obtain support in kind from Fire Services, water companies and the England and Wales Wildfire Forum, and advising on the writing the application. In this sense it is a spin-off from the KE Fellowship.

The University of Manchester Intellectual Property management service advised the project. The School of Environment, Education and Development is also supporting it; EnviroSAR will be the pilot for a new spatial data infrastructure to share geospatial data within the School.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A8A25BF-2935-400C-B661-C89BCE0FA83B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>EnviroSAR team are using the Copernicus development funding, in-kind support and mentoring from the UK Satellite Catapult to develop a web geoportal to assist Fire Services, water companies and conservation bodies to map and monitor wildfire burn scars, especially in peat moorlands. Mapping is not done by Fire Services and is only available for a small proportion of UK National Parks, yet cleaning-up of water discoloration costs water companies millions of pounds. The new technique uses radar intensity and coherence to map the perimeter of moorland wildfires. It will also monitor their persistence so can be used to assess natural regrowth of vegetation and the success of ecological restoration. Because it uses C-band radar images, it is ideally suited to exploit the new European Space Agency Sentinel products.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58caa8bb73fe51.56055242</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>EnviroSAR</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.copernicus-masters.com/downloads/2016/copernicus_results_booklet_2016.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EBE974DD-FA50-4709-B8D1-9BD8A830049A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of fire in UK peatland and moorland management: the need for informed, unbiased debate.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
