All countries at the centre of this project - South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, UK - are impacted by GBV/I but in South Africa and Lesotho, which have among the highest rates of reported rape worldwide, the situation is particularly acute. In all of South Africa, Lesotho and Botswana, moreover, GBV is compounded by high risk of HIV infection, with socio-economically deprived women and girls particularly vulnerable to both GBV and the hardships procured by HIV and Aids.

Expertise and resources from the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities (A&amp;amp;H) alongside targeted international collaboration can go a long way to providing sustainable support and development in innovative and effective ways. The A&amp;amp;H expertise focal to this project focuses especially on two disciplines: 
- biblical studies, because the Bible is highly influential and unprecedentedly available (in all indigenous languages) in all project countries, which all have Christian-dominant populations;
- gender studies, because GBV/I perpetuates damaging gender stereotypes which must be fully understood first to be effectively detoxified and resisted.

Another area of A&amp;amp;H expertise applied in the project is music and performance arts, in order to foster a creative, interactive and sustainable media of resistance. Outputs in this area - such as photographs, songs, survivor stories and live performance - also lend themselves to self-representation, allowing persons vulnerable to GBV (foremost girls and women but also members of the LGBTQ community) unfiltered media of expression, aimed at all of healing, empowerment and solidarity.

To address especially UN sustainable development goals pertaining to gender equality (#5), quality education (#4) and peace- and justice- building (#16), the project will: 
1) Harness energy, expertise and support of A&amp;amp;H academics in the three southern African project countries as well as in the UK and direct these towards social activism in the area of GBV through working together with relevant NGOs and community groups. The project's three core facilitators (one based in Botswana, two in the UK) are all biblical scholars, with each contributing also distinctive expertise in the areas of sexuality, HIV-theology or ethnicity. All have associations with NGOs and community groups active in addressing GBV/I, as well as passion for social justice.
2) Facilitate existing resources and create also new ones that will in a series of workshops explore the relationship between the Bible and GBV/I. Southern African NGOs and community groups are doing fabulous work in demanding circumstances but this is not always effectively shared due to inadequate networks. The project's facilitators will train at an established centre of socially engaged Bible study, the Ujamaa Centre in South Africa, and disseminate tried and tested resources as well as devise new ones to be trialled in a series of workshops in both Botswana and Lesotho.
3) Produce collaboratively artistic and self-representational media that actively resist GBV/I. Alongside educational and information resources produced in and for workshops, the project will facilitate also creative ways promoting personal expression and healing as well as community mobilization and solidarity. 
4) Disseminate information and resources in academic and popular forums, including on the open-access project website.
In diverse and innovative ways, the project seeks both to infuse academia with social justice, as well as creative outlets and social justice endeavours with high quality information and education. This will both strengthen and diversify existing and form also new networks and take a big and promising step towards sustained social betterment and justice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Throughout the lifetime of the project the members of the Management Board will integrate processes of research, engagement and impact. Potential impacts arising will be realized through a range of different activities and outputs, tailored to reach specific and relevant audiences.

Following training in contextual Bible study (CBS) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's Ujamaa Centre, Management Board members will adapt CBS resources and develop also their own based on visual images that combine or are relevant to both rape culture and the Bible. (A sample from popular culture media can be found in 'Visual Evidence'.) Together these will form the basis of a series of workshops on how biblical texts and images legitimate rape culture and gender-based violence and inequality (GBV/I) to be conducted in Botswana and Lesotho. Participants will be directed by both the Uni of Botswana (there will be 2 workshops: 1 with students and 1 with members of the Gender Policy and Programme Committee) and by NGOs working to support particularly women and girls at risk of or affected by GBV/I (4 more workshops). Letters confirm support from a number of relevant organizations in Botswana (Emang Basadi) and Lesotho (Help Lesotho). Additional support is in place from Botswana's Women's Shelter and LGBTQ support group Legabibo. Management Board expertise in biblical studies and Ujamaa techniques will thus be combined with NGOs' experiential knowledge and connections to identify and benefit persons at risk of GBV/I. The Management Board will also provide training for NGO support staff in addressing Christian rhetoric and biblical justifications for GBV/I. This includes the development of training materials for resisting homophobic biblical interpretation (especially pertinent for Legabibo).

The project will facilitate and develop alongside educational workshop resources also creative self-representational resources and a sustainable media of resistance through women's songs, high-quality images (to be made into posters) and live performances. These will provide counter narratives to endemic rape culture messages and will be recorded and widely disseminated on the project website, as well as social media channels of Management Board and project partners (e.g Twitter @ProjShiloh). Contacts with Botswana Society for the Arts Project and Maitisong Festival and support from Sheffield's Global Soundtrack Programme to realize this endeavour with professionalism are secured.

PI and CI will receive expert training and advice from the Sheffield Feminist Archive to work with Emang Basadi and conduct voluntary interviews with survivors of GBV. This can be a powerful tool of healing and ownership and subject to ethical approval can (via the project website) provide resources for other survivors as well as for support service professionals.

The PP will make public presentations at the Uni of Leeds Centre for Religion and Public Life and at two of Uni Sheffield's public engagement initiatives, Hidden Perspectives and the Shiloh Project, to disseminate Ujamaa methods and the network's own resources.

PI and CI have met Botswana's Minister of Education and will take forward discussion about the integration of rape culture education by applying the project's resources at every level of schooling, which holds enormous potential for long-term and beneficial impact on pedagogical policy. 

The project website will bring together a wide range of resources (academic, activist and self-representational) to open the way for more inclusive public debate and to benefit both survivors of GBV/I and professionals working with them. 

Impact will extend from the local to the international and benefit a wide range of vulnerable persons (LGBTQ persons, women, girls) in all project countries. Throughout, efforts will be made to extend the network and its reach. Towards this endevour existing media connections (popular press, radio and TV) will be fully exploited.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41875</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R003718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC4405D9-8A0D-41F9-B71A-A19C9CD0AEFA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnicity</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E4EA379F-BD4C-4BD5-8D47-B49EBF7EC90E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Testament</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A014841-1385-4320-A44B-CBD99E1B8EBE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Old Testament</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
