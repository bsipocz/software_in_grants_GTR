It is caused by asbestos, usually encountered through work in trade industries such as shipbuilding and engineering. Asbestos promotes chronic inflammation which leads on to scarring (fibrosis) and Mesothelioma. We know from statistical models that 1 in 170 men born in the 1940s will die of mesothelioma. It is locally aggressive and causes pain, anorexia, breathlessness and inexorable death usually within one year of diagnosis. Britain has the highest death rate from Mesothelioma in the world, and part of that problem is that no good treatment exists for this condition. Mesothelioma is essentially resistant to all types of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 

Mesothelioma is associated with massive fibrosis around the cancer. Professor Sethi was the first to demonstrate that fibrosis and scarring around cancers stimulate growth and protect cancers from chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Examining the difference between normal mesothelial cells and malignant mesothelioma cells, Professor Sethi has identified three molecules: CD98, Galectin-3 and beta1 integrins, which are markedly up regulated in Mesothelioma cells. These three molecules physically associate and are centrally involved in chronic inflammation and fibrous scarring and may therefore play a key role in the growth and resistance to chemotherapy/radiotherapy of malignant mesothelioma cells. Blocking the function of these molecules on mesothelioma cells may lead to a novel approach to treat Mesothelioma. Human mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients will be used to understand the interactions between CD98, Galectin-3 and beta1 integrins and how they contribute to growth and drug resistance. A mouse model of mesothelioma will be used to evaluate the clinical use of a number of drug treatments against this CD98/galectin-3/beta1 integrin complex for patients with Mesothelioma.

This work will evaluate three specific strategies i) anti-CD98 ii) anti-galectin-3 and iii) anti-beta1 integrin as new treatment options for the treatment of patients with malignant mesothelioma. This work will also examine the broader treatment option of anti-inflammatory agents and anti-fibrotic strategies to treat mesothelioma. Pleural effusion (an accumulation of fluid around the lining of the lung, which causes extreme breathlessness) and fibrotic lung scarring are major problems for patients with Mesothelioma. It is anticipated that these strategies will also palliate patient's symptoms. Furthermore, the establishment of an animal model of mesothelioma in a normal mouse with an intact immune system would be a major step forward allowing a better understanding of the disease in real life and also provide a good model in which to test the drugs specific for mesothelioma before starting human clinical trials.

This research will be carried out in Professor Tariq Sethi's lab. He has considerable expertise in the field of inflammation and cancer and is considered an world authority on Galectin3, one of the central molecules of interest in this work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Hypothesis: This fellowship will test the hypothesis that in MM cells galectin-3 and CD98 promotes proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy in MM cells and the permissive inflammatory tumour environmental in a beta1 integrin dependent manner
Aim: To determine the impact of galectin-3 and CD98 on beta1 integrin-mediated functions in MM cells in vitro and in vivo. Key beta1-integrin functions will be examined: cell proliferation, chemoresistance, ECM secretion and fibronectin matrix assembly. Manipulation of galectin-3/CD98/beta1 integrins in MM cells prior to co-culture with macrophages on macrophage phenotype will be examined.
These results will inform the experimental crux of this fellowship - to determine the effect of intrapleural administration of an inhibitory agent (defined by the in vitro experiments) on mesothelioma growth and associated inflammation and fibrosis and mesothelioma sensitivity to chemotherapy . 
Efficacy of this agent will be assessed by PET/MRI in a murine model. We will address molecular mechanisms by examining in vitro cell signalling cascades and in vivo by novel imaging techniques.
Medical Potential: to identify key molecules driving the inflammatory microenvironment and tumour propagation and to pharmacologically/ genetically inhibit these pathways. To drive this research forward to the creation of a novel treatment for malignant mesothelioma and to potentially improve the efficacy of existing treatments.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our aim is to better characterise the inflammatory process in mesothelioma and how this can be translated into providing new treatment options, improving standard treatment and targeting the root problem of chemoresistance. 

Due to its latent onset of presentation - sometimes decades post exposure from industrial asbestos - we will face an unprecedented epidemic of mesothelioma. It is not usually metastatic but locally aggressive, and from this local disease progression the patient succumbs. This is devastating to watch- intuitively one feels local disease should be more effectively controlled. In this window between local disease and spread if appropriate treatments are developed then the opportunity to cure or control the disease exists.

Mesothelioma has traditionally occurred in lower socioeconomic classes. It is an epidemic with a long span between exposure and presentation. We know from statistical models that 1 in 170 men born in the 1940s will die of mesothelioma. Britiain currently has the highest death rate from mesothelioma in the world, with deaths predicted to peak in 2020. It is invariably fatal, with most patients dead within 1 yr of first presentation. This problem is unlikely to disappear- although complete bans on the use of asbestos are in place in 52 countries, in other countries (including China, Brazil, India) the production, sale and use of asbestos continues to thrive. The mesothelioma burden in the UK is likely to be the tip of the global iceberg and with this in mind urgent research is required. In addition we now recognise risks posed by other industries such as nanotube production. Nanotubes are inert and shaped like asbestos fibres. It is predicted that diseases relating to these will follow a similar projected mechanism of action and timeline to mesothelioma. This may represent a health threat not yet apparent and our work will inform future studies in this area.

Due to the latent mode of presentation there is a high occupational disease impact. This includes direct medical costs; indirect costs including loss of productivity, foregone opportunities and diminished investment. The socioeconomic burden of mesothelioma includes pain, disability and impaired quality of life at an individual level. Disruptions to family, career, steadily increasing mortality rates and high cost of treatment are at present inevitable.

Only one study has ever explored healthcare costs specifically relating to mesothelioma. This showed a UK figure in the year 2000 to NHS hospitals of approximately &amp;pound;16,014,646. Primary care costs, including caregiver costs, are not included in this analysis. These substantial disease costs have some international generalisability. This does not include the projected burden of compensation to the western economy, which worldwide is estimated at approx 195billion pounds. This, irrespective of other compelling factors, should be an incentive to stimulate urgent research.

At present the evidence for treatment in mesothelioma is scanty at best. There are no guidelines and indeed no gold standard treatment to lead care. Current dual chemotherapy is a 'best fit' regime with no compelling evidence as to efficacy. Cisplatin and pemextred- the combination currently licensed for use in unresectable MPM- precipitated a storm initially when NICE did not feel the evidence sufficient for cost effectiveness and pemextred was refused a licence. It is worth noting that the extension of life (2.8 months) offered by this dual regimen is less than that previously judged to be acceptable to NSCLC patients when weighed against the toxicity of a platinum based regime. On this basis of urgent clinical need a good model of disease such as ours with validation of appropriate targets could quickly lead to new drug development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251643</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4235416C-1241-4CE6-ADBE-C655794FCF26</gtr:id><gtr:title>Advances in molecular biology of lung disease: aiming for precision therapy in non-small cell lung cancer.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chest</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5042efa8b4187acf0f6974abda328da3"><gtr:id>5042efa8b4187acf0f6974abda328da3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rooney C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0012-3692</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56e0b7aa29a6a1.36991426</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36C0DC3C-CE12-4A9F-B9E8-79F0F2E44375</gtr:id><gtr:title>Biomarkers for precision medicine in airways disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5042efa8b4187acf0f6974abda328da3"><gtr:id>5042efa8b4187acf0f6974abda328da3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rooney C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0077-8923</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56e0b7aa44da50.45843736</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K00252X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
