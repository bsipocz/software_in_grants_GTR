Their high environmental, social and economic value is reflected in EU and UK government policy through legislation targeted at managing these assets in sustainable and integrated ways. This policy is tasked with balancing future economic growth from continued human activities (e.g. ports, navigation, marine renewables), socio-economic impacts from increasing coastal erosion and flood risk, and the protection and enhancement of sensitive habitats and ecosystems. Under these competing demands, there is an urgent need for coordinated sediment management plans for UK estuaries and coastal regions to ensure sustainable practices are implemented and improved resilience in future planning strategies is realised. 

To achieve these challenging goals, it is vital that engineers and scientists have the fundamental understanding of physical processes controlling the dynamic behaviour of sediments in estuarine and coastal systems and their role in large-scale morphological evolution. One of the biggest challenges to this, however, is a current lack of knowledge on the behaviour of mixed bed sediments that contain both non-cohesive sands and cohesive muds. Critical shortcomings in current estuarine and coastal modelling systems typically relate to their inadequate representation of important small-scale dynamical processes associated with these sand-mud mixtures including erosion, entrainment, flocculation, settling and deposition. As a consequence, the sensitivity of many estuaries and near-shore coastal regions to future impacts from climate change and anthropogenic development is currently subject to a high degree of uncertainty. 

The proposed project will address these shortcomings in a systematic way. The research programme includes fundamental experimental studies in sophisticated settling column and benthic annular flume facilities to investigate these mixed sediment processes in greater quantitative detail than previously undertaken. This experimental work will be complemented by novel analytical model developments to provide better understanding of mixed sediment flocculation and differential settling processes through more physics-based descriptions of the important sand-mud interactions involved. A key outcome from this research will be to establish, for the first time, important linkages between these sand-mud interactions within mixed sediment suspensions and the resulting structural and compositional characteristics of mixed sediment bed deposits. The combined experimental data and analytical model outputs from this project will underpin the development of advanced numerical models required for the development of more sustainable and resilient estuarine and coastal sediment management strategies in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential beneficiaries from the research outcomes of this project will include: academic researchers (e.g. universities and research institutes); regulatory bodies and statutory consultants (e.g. SEPA, EA, Marine Scotland); environmental consultants and modellers; port authorities; marine renewables developers; and the UK and Scottish Governments.

From an economic perspective, a wide range of industry sectors are dependent on functional estuaries (e.g. ports, marine renewables, aggregate/sand extraction, aquaculture and fisheries, land reclamation, water abstraction, etc.). However, the economic success of many of these sectors depends entirely on the adoption of appropriate sediment management schemes to ensure both navigational access and minimal requirement for on-going remedial measures (e.g. maintenance dredging) within these environments. Intuitively, such anthropogenic interventions will lead to regional alterations to sediment sources (budgets), transport pathways and sinks, as well as local scour and sediment redistribution around individual marine structures. In this regard, the proposed project will provide much-needed clarity in the fundamental understanding mixed (sand-mud) sediment transport processes, typically encountered in these estuarine and near-shore environments. This will benefit future economic growth within these sectors by driving improvements in the representation of these processes within fully-coupled, integrated coastal modelling systems, required to improve current spatial planning practices and ensure more efficient and sustainable development within these environments. This is particularly crucial for the UK marine renewable energy sector to maintain its competitive advantage in the global market.

Recent UK Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management (FCERM) research strategy also highlights research into sediment management as being an urgent priority for political and operational drivers relating to the socio-economic impacts of coastal erosion and flooding. In the UK, over at least 6 million properties are &amp;quot;at risk&amp;quot; of flooding from a wide range of sources including rivers, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater; while in Scotland alone, over 30,000 are known to be at direct risk from coastal flooding. This is especially pertinent given that these current risk levels are likely to increase under growing climatic and socio-ecomonic pressures. Similarly, pressures are also prevalent from an environmental perspective as estuaries and coastal zones are often made up of highly-productive habitats and ecosystems that are protected under existing EU legislation (e.g. Water Framework Directive, Birds and Habitats Directives). As such, the integration of ecological and socio-economic values is increasingly advocated within near-shore spatial planning as being essential to ensure sustainable development within these enviroments. Thus, through improved linkages between mixed sediment transport and morphological processes, the project outcomes will inform the development of integrated and adaptive management strategies that are both resilient to this increasing flooding and erosion risk, whilst ensuring protection of these important and sensitive ecosystems.
 
To this end, the proposed project aims to deliver research outputs focused on fundamental processes such as sand-mud erosion, flocculation, settling and deposition that will facilitate improved prediction of mixed sediment sources, transport pathways and sinks within regional-scale transport and morphological models. The critical pathway towards realising the socio-economic and environmental impacts and benefits from the proposed research will be delivered through the immediate availability of project outputs that are strategically beneficial to UK engineering consultancies, marine scientists and governmental agencies tasked with legislation and policy implementation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99391</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Partrac</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Enhanced Characterisation of Mixed Sediment Dynamics: Application of Lab-Based Techniques in the Field</gtr:description><gtr:id>EFF4F3EE-2CD8-4711-A801-7D1BF8FD1CDB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project has lead to the development and testing of (i) a laboratory characterisation technique, based on electrical resistivity measurements, to measure the response of mixed (sand-clay) sediment beds to cyclic hydrodynamic forcing generated within a benthic annular flume (i.e. representing the influence of cyclic tidal currents), and (ii) a prototype field-based electrical resistivity profiling technique to investigate in-situ characterisation of discontinuities in subsurface composition within intertidal estuarine beds (i.e. Eden estuary, Fife, UK).

This has generated significant interest from both external UK research groups and industrial project stakeholders (e.g. PARTRAC Ltd; HR Wallingford) in relation to enhanced field measurements of coastal/marine sediment transport processes. The PI has also be invited to participate in two Special Interest Groups (SIGs) of the UK Fluids Network, namely &amp;quot;Experimental Flow Diagnostics&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Granular Flows in the Environment and Industry&amp;quot;.

The outcomes from the work have also motivated applications and awards for additional funding through an EPSRC IAA award (&amp;pound;50k) and a Carnegie Trust Research Incentive Grant (&amp;pound;7.5k) to further develop laboratory and field measurement techniques for sand-mud characterisation. The IAA award, in particular, supported an inward industry secondment to Heriot Watt of a marine scientist from PARTRAC Ltd to work on laboratory/ field characterisation techniques for investigating the response of sand-mud bed layers to cyclic hydrodynamic forcing (i.e. mimicking the effect of cyclic tidal currents), with the aim of benchmarking laboratory studies of cyclic erosion, deposition and segregation within idealized sand-mud sediment beds with equivalent measurements at an estuarine field site (Eden estuary, St Andrews).

The experimental findings and modelling studies conducted during the grant are also forming the basis for applications for additional research funding in the form of a proposed Early-Career EPSRC Fellowship application in the priority theme of Particle Technology and a Royal Society application to the Paul Instrument Fund. These applications are currently in development for submission in Spring 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0566AB54-30D1-403B-9CDB-D8850C9DF10C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5453a7b7ee7748.12560490</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Parametric experimental studies investigating the dynamic behaviour of mixed sediments have been undertaken to gain new knowledge on (i) small scale fluid-sediment interactions controlling the flocculation and settling characteristics of sand-mud suspensions, and (ii) sedimentation processes leading to the development of mixed and segregated bed layers within sand-mud bed deposits. Better fundamental understanding of these processes is essential to improve their representation within estuarine and coastal sediment transport models tasked with accurately predicting transport fluxes and morphodynamic change within these mixed sedimentary environments.

Main findings and developments from study are as follows:

(i) Development and application of new measurement techniques and characterisation of sand-mud deposits (WP2):

An electrical resistivity profiling technique has been developed and applied successfully to characterise layer segregation within mixed sediment (sand-clay) deposits under natural sedimentation processes. Calibration of this resistiviry technique has also enabled the depthwise variation of more physically-relevant parameters such as bulk density, volumetric concentration and porosity to be established for these deposits. Application of this electrical resistivity technique to investigate the natural sedimentation from mixed (sand-clay) suspensions has revealed the formation of distinctive bed deposit structures, with the degree of segregation found to be dependent largely on the initial mixture composition within the suspension. The proposed physical mechanisms under which this bed segregation occurs has also been demonstrated qualitatively by the application of a polydisperse, hindered settling model for cohesive and non-cohesive sediment mixtures. The findings from work have been submitted as a journal paper and are currently under review in Ocean Dynamics.

The resistivity technique has also been adapted successfully to study the restructuring of mixed sediment beds when subjected to cyclic erosion/deposition events generated within benthic annular flume experiments (i.e. Voyager I and II benthic flumes provided by PARTRAC Ltd.). These experiments were designed and conducted to attempt to better simulate the response of mixed sediment beds to cyclic tidal currents, as commonly encountered in dynamic estuarine environments. Findings indicate that bed mixtures with relatively low mud contents (&amp;lt; 5% clay by weight) were mobilised under higher shear conditions, resulting in the development of bed forms (i.e. ripples and dunes) and sand-mud segregation within the upper mobilised layer. By contrast, for mixtures with higher mud contents (&amp;gt; 7% clay by mass), there was little indication of the development of bed forms or sand-mud segregation under the same cyclic flow conditions. This work was presented at INTERCOH 2015 and will be submitted as a journal paper in due course.

(ii) Findings from grid-stirred settling column experiments on flocculation of sand-mud mixtures (WP1 &amp;amp; WP3):

Parametric experiments have been conducted within a sophisticated grid-stirred settling column to investigate flocculation processes for sand-mud mixtures. Results from the tests indicate that flocculation properties such as aggregation rates (i.e. floc development) and the maximal floc sizes generated within the column are strongly affected by external parameters including: (i) suspension composition (sand-mud ratio), (ii) total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration within the column, (iii) turbulent shear levels generated by the oscillating grids, and (iv) water salinity. In this regard, the largest flocs were typically generated for clay-only suspensions within brackish water, under high TSS and low turbulent shear levels, with the addition of sand to the column shown to reduce the maximal size of flocs generated, whilst having negligible effect on root-mean-square floc sizes. Within individual runs, floc sizes were shown to increase non-linearly with increasing TSS concentrations within the column, potentially due to (i) temporal lag effects in floc development rates (i.e. under non-equilibrium conditions); and (ii) the additional influence of sand particles in inhibiting floc growth through differential settling effects and direct sand particle collisions with flocs. At the end of individual runs, once TSS concentrations had typically stabilised within the column, floc sizes generated in both mud-only and sand-mud suspensions were shown to scale well with a dimensional parameter incorporating both TSS and shear rate G, similar to (but varying from) previous flocculation studies conducted under so-called equilibrium conditions.

A numerical model has been developed employing a poly-disperse, population balance technique (PDM) within a simplified 1DV model framework to investigate flocculation and settling characteristics under the parametric conditions tested within the experimental runs. Simulations have shown the the temporal change in TSS concentrations within the settling column and corresponding changes to representative root-mean-square and maximal floc sizes can be simulated well by this approach for mud-only (i.e. mono-disperse) suspensions. For sand-mud suspensions, it is proposed that additional break-up mechanisms can account for the direct influence of sand particles in inhibiting the development of mud flocs within the column, as demonstrated within the experiments themselves. This numerical modelling work is has been completed and a journal paper on the joint experimental and numerical study entitled &amp;quot;Model Studies for Flocculation of Sand-Clay Mixtures&amp;quot; has now been submitted for review to Coastal Engineering (Elsevier) (IF 2.84) in December 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Development of the new methodology for characterising mixed sediment deposits has been taken forward through the award of an EPSRC IAA grant award to support development of advanced alb and field-based versions of the measurement technique, in collaboration with an industry partner (see Collaborations &amp;amp; Partnerships).

The technique has subsequently been developed to provide detailed, in-situ, field profile measurements of electrical resistivity in order to characterise the substrate structure and composition of estuarine bed deposits that include a wider range of natural mixed sediments (sands, silts, muds, organics).
