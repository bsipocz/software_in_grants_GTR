Note that this summary may be published on the AHRC's website in the event that a grant is awarded.
Digitization of 20th Century cultural heritage is severely restricted due to the real or potential subsistence of copyright and related rights. Under the new European laws on orphan works, a large amount of cultural heritage whose copyright status is uncertain could possibly be lawfully digitized by cultural institutions on condition that a &amp;quot;diligent search&amp;quot; of the rightholders has been performed. While these diligent searches trigger prohibitively high costs for institutional users, the project designs a cost effective de-centralized system that enables cultural institutions across Europe to source information from end-users and determine the copyright status of works contained in their collections. Ultimately, the project will allow for an enhanced access to 20th Century cultural heritage and will contribute to enable use and re-use of items that would otherwise remain scarcely known and certainly unexploited.
Key objectives of EnDOW are:
? To analyse the legal requirement of &amp;quot;diligent search&amp;quot; across the orphan works legislation of the 15 countries members of Heritage Plus
? To investigate best practices of orphan works clearance across cultural heritage sectors (libraries, archives and museums);
? (Based on this knowledge:) to design, implement and optimize an online platform for crowd-sourced diligent searching on works contained in the collections of European cultural institutions;
? To study the potential applications and challenges of the crowd-based search method for images, film and born-digital cultural heritage works.
Through analytical and empirical approaches to mass digitization, the project will foster knowledge exchange between cultural heritage stakeholders, including small and medium size institutions. It will prodgh-value tool to maximise sustainable management of recent cultural heritage and use and re-use of related cultural artefacts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Since this project is mainly aimed at cultural heritage institutions (libraries, archives, museums), the expectation is that the public will deal with works that have a high probability of being orphans (for example old books, pictures and films). Users will therefore perform the costly right clearance exercise in place of the involved institutions, and take the relevant steps required by the competent jurisdictions (e.g., mostly contacting the relevant collecting societies) thus clearing the rights for a large amount of artworks, which will become available for use and reuse by the public at large.
The EnDOW platform, by allowing low-cost right clearance for potentially orphan works is an extremely high-value tool applicable in the short and medium term to maximise the sustainable management of our cultural heritage, by allowing the use and re-use of cultural artefacts.
The outputs of this project will impact on relevant stakeholders in a number of ways:
Working closely with institutions potentially involved in mass digitisation of cultural heritage (libraries, museums, archives) in several countries and delivering capacity-building events (conferences, workshops) will maximize the research outputs through knowledge transfer between researchers, institutions, policy-makers and the public.
The project will also target voluntaries and communities of artworks users and cultural heritage preservation NGOs, which will find in EnDOW a vehicle to fulfil their mission and to maximise their achievements.
Strongly promoting interaction among stakeholders (cultural heritage institutions, academic and no-profit institutions that manage online databases, collecting societies, and the public) will ultimately enhance the dissemination capacity of public institutions and hence public access to cultural heritage artefacts, which in turn will allow further transformative cultural production.
To policy-makers, the project will provide pioneeristic solutions to difficult and costly problems, which could later be implemented in other domains. It would serve as a model on the much-debated problem of centralised mass licensing which has hitherto absorbed large investments and it is recognised as a crucial engine for the knowledge economy.
To private stakeholders the project can offer an unprecedented testing environment for a new business model, which applies the power of crowd-sourcing to mass licensing of intellectual assets.
In conclusion, EnDOW will provide cultural institutions and private stakeholders with unprecedented tools to address the problem of mass digitization, and in particular of right clearance on large scale. This experience has the potential of being further expanded, ameliorated and employed by public and private stakeholders within and beyond the domain of cultural artefacts. This technology will be available on an experimental basis (beta version) at the end of the second year of the project, and it will be available to the public at large at the end of the project. It will be therefore usable in the short to medium term. The high value of this platform is self-explicative: it will substantially erode the costs of mass right clearance without any evident drawback.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146114</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Europeana Space, Hamburger Bahnhof</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DEC4CA3-32D4-4882-A1AE-088318E424D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Laura Bertoni, 'Introducing the EnDOW project: Enhancing Access to 20th Century Cultural Heritage through Distributed Orphan Works Clearance', Europeana Space, Hamburger Bahnhof, Museum f&amp;uuml;r Gegenwart, Berlin (Nov 2016).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ca2a0419c8.97530933</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://uk.icom.museum/events/international-events/europeana-space-3rd-international-conference-cultural-heritage-reuse-remake-reimagine/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop &quot;Making sense of diligent search&quot;, University of Amsterdam 30 June 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A20E5832-833C-4800-BFF0-78087803EA81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop with representatives of European cultural heritage institutions, organized as part of the EnDOW project at the University of Amsterdam</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2d007ca4930.22914613</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://diligentsearch.eu/2016/07/07/endow-workshop-making-sense-of-diligent-search/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2006</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Copyright Education Symposium, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01FA529D-D93A-4F65-BF39-E4E8A9AE788E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Victoria Stobo, Discussed EnDOW at Copyright Education Symposium&amp;nbsp;24th May 2016 BPI Offices, London 9-4.30pm</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c86885ce61.28154560</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.create.ac.uk/blog/2016/05/18/copyright-education-symposium-london-24-may/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Digital Catapult Centre, London, 29 September 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>755B002F-58B6-4DF1-9E04-E5FA3837FE3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation on &amp;quot;Crowdsourcing diligent search: a solution for the orphan works problem?&amp;quot;

Our analysis of diligent search requirements in 20 EU Member States has been used by the EU Intellectual Property Office (the EU agency with responsibility for the orphan works database) to inform national authorities that are in the process of establishing guidelines for diligent search.
We have been invited by the UK Intellectual Property Office to present evidence on the functioning of orphan works legislation in two occasions: 1) in relation to the submission by the UK government of an observation in the case Soulier &amp;amp; Doke (European Court of Justice, case C-301/15) and in the framework of a consultation on the proposed new copyright directive in the Digital Single Market.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D5614D71-AEC2-4C43-9B76-8B35706324F3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9425bcb5e4.51085784</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main goal of EnDOW is to facilitate the task of copyright clearance for cultural heritage institutions engaged in the digitization of their collections. Copyright clearance is a difficult and time-consuming process. The main idea is to develop an online tool that can be used by a non-specialized audience to help cultural institutions to carry out the process. Legally speaking, the process crucially involves a &amp;quot;diligent search&amp;quot; of the possible copyright holders. Our project has streamlined the diligent search process, it has tailored it to different categories of works (such as books, journals, audio and audiovisual works) and it has made it applicable to 20 different countries of the EU (in each of which there are different legal requirements). The result is a set of 60 flowcharts of operations, that in the next months will be implemented in an online interactive platform.

Our project has so far identified a number of pitfalls and issues in the current legislative framework. In particular, the fact that a high number of sources and databases that must be consulted in the course of a diligent search are not available to the public. In the 20 countries we have examined, on average 36% of sources are not freely accessible online. However, failing to consult these sources while carrying out a diligent search may result in copyright infringement - a risk that many cultural institutions are not prepared to take.

Once in operation, our platform is expected 1) to reduce the costs and the difficulties of the diligent search process, and 2) to mitigate the risks of carrying out invalid diligent searches.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings reported in Report 1 will serve as a basis to design the Beta version of the diligent search platform (which is the main Deliverable of the project). However, the findings have also independent policy significance. In our study, which was conducted in three countries (UK, Italy and Netherlands), we reveal that carrying out a Diligent Search may require consultation of an overly high quantity of diverse sources of information. Most importantly, our analysis shows that a sizeable share of these sources is not easily accessible or, even, not accessible at all. The study also suggests a possible solution to this problem that involves soft-law intervention to establish hierarchies among sources for Diligent Search, with a diversification between compulsory and optional sources, depending on their relevance and accessibility.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7F120BE3-3007-428F-B40C-DDC6EE112C5C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd965b391792.81575708</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://diligentsearch.eu/resources/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database includes all sources that have to be consulted in order to carry out a diligent search for the purpose of digitizing and publishing orphan works in the following jurisdictions: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Check Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E14D785-1FBB-45A3-951B-A66633E3D086</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We intend to share this database with the EU IPO, whom is working to the compilation of a similar database.
