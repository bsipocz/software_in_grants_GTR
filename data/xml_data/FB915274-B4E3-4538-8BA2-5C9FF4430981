Engender engagement through strong curation of our laboratory theme that presents finished artworks alongside the research behind them.
Highlight Boulby Underground Laboratory as a unique space and hidden gem of UK scientific research. Bring together the arts &amp;amp; sciences in a collaborative project attracting interest across disciplines &amp;amp; from those outside these fields. 
Be inclusive in our approach. Introduce families and the public to particle physics through art as an accessible route to understanding more about the universe.
We aim to make direct contact with the hard to reach communities in Hackney, London and Skinningrove, Cleveland through leafleting and email to local groups offering a friendly welcome to all-comers. 
Expand public knowledge on dark matter theory through informative talks and Q&amp;amp;A sessions from scientists. Present performances and artworks that question sources of knowledge and encourage debate across disciplines to encourage inquisitive thinking.
Expand on dark matter research to consider how we visualise the invisible, what it means to be dark, what detection methods can be used and what motivates our curiosity in pursuing the unknown. 
Share the artists' personal experience in learning about dark matter and how this is reflected in their work as an example of the many facets of interest that physics can inspire. Remove the barriers between art and science in the public consciousness to show a shared creative potential inspired by awe of the physical world and how ideas from one sphere can stimulate the other. Explore common ground that artists &amp;amp; scientists inhabit as they seek to understand the mysteries of the universe and our role as individuals within it.
We will discuss the implications of dark matter detection, should it occur, what changes about the way we see the universe and how this might impact our everyday lives. 
Offer a high quality stimulating experience of inventive workshops, interactive &amp;amp; thought provoking artworks as a key to kindling a lasting fascination in discovering more about the unknown structures of the universe.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Awareness raising of exhibitions and associated events will be online, on paper &amp;amp; in person. A social media campaign will be run by Sarah Gillett (18 years' experience as arts strategist specialising in digital programming &amp;amp; educational frameworks. Previously Global Head of Arts Digital, British Council currently working across public &amp;amp; commercial sectors, exploiting new technologies to help institutions connect to online audiences). Social channels led by unique content to build an audience &amp;amp; attract interest through intriguing imagery &amp;amp; quotes, inciting curiosity with links to new articles &amp;amp; dark matter research, behind-the-scenes insights, comments from artists &amp;amp; scientists plus info/uploads of our events. National &amp;amp; regional audiences will be targeted via our Twitter persona; Instagram for behind-the-scenes content; Pinterest boards for artists, scientists &amp;amp; public to contribute to. Invites sent (email + selected by post) to Artists, Academics, Students, Curators, Gallerists, Critics, contemporary art enthusiasts via our own extensive networks as studio artists &amp;amp; connections to RCA, LCC, Goldsmiths, CSM, Visual Arts Ireland, a-n (artists network), Bloomberg New Contemporaries, Scottish New Contemporaries, Arts Catalyst. 
Those from science via Boulby Underground Laboratory, Imperial, UCL, Dark Matter Research networks (31 institutions collaborating). Contacts made at Science Fair visits (Royal Society, New Scientist) followed up with direct invitations &amp;amp; requests to share to mailing lists. Hobbyists &amp;amp; groups keen to expand knowledge located via council adult education/local activity lists &amp;amp; relevant social forums. Young people via invitations/flyers sent to specialist schools, physics &amp;amp; art depts.
Families/Tourists targeted via flyers distributed to local libraries, museums &amp;amp; tourist information offices. Invitations to 6 Astronomy clubs in N. Yorkshire (eg Whitby &amp;amp; District Astronomical Society); Whitby Lit. &amp;amp; Philosophical Society &amp;amp; Engineers via technological institutions (eg Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining) Residents &amp;amp; Tourists via talks &amp;amp; flyers at Whitby Museum, using documentation from Guest Projects to direct people to the Mining Museum exhibition. Press releases to local &amp;amp; national publications, magazine &amp;amp; online platforms (eg. Art News, Art Licks, Time Out). Royal Academy magazine - confirmed article on project. Local radio (eg East London Radio) invited to interview artists/scientists. Our partners will also disseminate marketing material. Guest Projects via Yinka Shonibare MBE (RA) twitter-7000 followers, Instagram-3200 followers; Yinka's Newsletter-3,000 subscribers; Guest Projects Facebook; mailing list 2,200 subscribers. Cleveland Mining Museum via own website, social media &amp;amp; mailing list, established educational outreach programme for children, regular workshop attendees, local monthly publications, press releases to 8 local/regional newspapers, 3 local radio stations, BBC/ITV local news, member of 15 Tourism websites (eg. Welcome to Yorkshire &amp;amp; North York Moors National Park)

Dissemination of content produced for future legacy - Artworks responding to dark matter theory will be put forward to other institutions and galleries as proposals for future exhibitions in other locations. For example Neo:Gallery in Bolton have expressed an intertest in hosting a Laboratory of Dark Matters exhibition. Publication - this will be sent to institutions and galleries as a promotional tool. Video documentation will be posted online and on our website which will be updated with future events as well as other research material and articles of interest</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3600</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R001340/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
