&lt;p>We will also develop software implementations of our auction procedures.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Likely beneficiaries of our improved auction designs are in the following areas where the Applicant and Co-Investigator have already developed working relationships (see Pathways to Impact):

Central Banks 
 Within the Bank of England (which the Applicant continues to advise), one possible use of an extended Product-Mix Auction might be to implement recommendations in the October 2012 Winters Review; another possibility would be to run a future version of the Asset Purchase Facility to buy corporate bonds using a Product-Mix Auction approach. These applications require a thorough understanding of complications arising from using more than two goods (especially issues about representing bidders', and the auctioneer's, preferences in user-friendly ways).
 There will likely be other applications in central banking and, of course, in other central banks. 

Other Financial Applications 
 There are many other potential applications in finance. For example, a version of our proposed auction that could handle very many goods might be used to do batch processing of stock trades to eliminate high-frequency trading problems (as suggested by, for example, Professors Budish and Cramton).

Telecommunications Authorities
 The Applicant and Co-Investigator have already had discussions with officials of the U.K.'s OFCOM about possible applications of potential developments of the Product Mix Auction in several contexts including spectrum allocation. The Applicant has had similar discussions with the US's Federal Communications Commission where he has been a pro bono consultant. OFCOM's Director of Competition Economics (Mr. Geoffrey Myers) has said he would like to arrange future discussions about specific applications of extensions of the Product-Mix Auction. A particular feature of these applications is potential complications arising from bidders viewing different goods as complements.

Energy auctions
 Both the current and the previous Cabinet Ministers for Energy and Climate Change have consulted the Applicant about potential uses of auctions within the energy industry, and the Co-Investigator has spent two months consulting on this issue within the department. As noted above, The Economist (Dec 1, 2012, p33) recently wrote, the U.K. &amp;quot;is due to start auctioning electricity-supply contracts as early as 2017. ... by the 2020s, it is hoped, such auctions will be held across technologies. 'We would be the first country in the world to achieve that', boasts [the Cabinet Minister].&amp;quot; The Applicant has advised that more work on auction design needs to be done if the Minister's boast of a 'world-first' is to be achieved--an extension of the Product-Mix Auction is a natural candidate for this application. The Department's Chief Economist (Dr. Steven Fries) has said he is keen for the Department to continue to interact with the Applicant and Co-Investigator on these issues. In this context there are potential complications arising from the auctioneer viewing different goods as complements.
 
Other Public Sector Applications
 Examples of other UK government departments which the Applicant has advised (pro bono), and which the project results might in due course benefit, include the Departments for Business, Innovation and Skills; for Communities and Local Government; and for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. 

Applications in Industry
 The Applicant is routinely contacted by commercial firms, and occasionally provides pro bono advice. These contacts will give opportunities to introduce these ideas to industry via our easy-to-use demonstration versions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>434028</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bank of England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ILTR</gtr:description><gtr:id>E05DC813-3E5F-4FC7-B7B9-AC549A0313AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>more efficient auctions:
