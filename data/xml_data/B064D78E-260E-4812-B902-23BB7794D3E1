challenges of dismantling nuclear submarines</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005746/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The problem of dismantling nuclear submarines is a current political issue and high-risk environmental problem. From a military perspective the issue is viewed as a technical problem that can be resolved by engineering and technology. Inviting artists to consider the aesthetic, conceptual, ethical and cultural problems of nuclear submarines will dramatically shift the terms of the debate. The research will investigate complex issues of power, visibility, and political representation, as well as having a keen material and conceptual interest in the socio-political history, and conceptual nature of nuclear weapons.

This fellowship will enable Ele Carpenter to undertake the theoretical research needed to bring together scientists, engineers and community groups with artists and ethicists to develop new opportunities for creative practice investigating nuclear culture. Whilst there is much research into nuclear technologies, there is little analysis of the cultural and conceptual questions of nuclear materials within the language of visual art. Her positive relationships with artists, the Nuclear Submarine Forum, SDP-AG and Arts Catalyst, along with her academic and curatorial experience put her in a unique position to undertake this work and publish highly original research material. The research will contribute to the level of critical enquiry within these partnership groups and organizations. 

The Nuclear Culture research aims to have a profound impact on the discussion of Nuclear Submarines in the public realm; it will have a high public profile involving not just subject area specialists but a wide cross-section of the public. This will be achieved by producing a website and academic research dissemination as well as the generation of a commissioning proposal. In addition, the research process will establish a context for artist's dialogue by developing good relationships with the key partners, researching the theoretical, critical and art-historical context of the project, and situating it within a wider cultural debate. The research will investigate how artistic practices can contribute to the interdisciplinary discourse surrounding the cultural problem of dismantling nuclear submarines though an investigation of dismantling, cultural memes and intergenerational equity, supporting new forms of language, art, and culture which can carry ideas over time throughout centuries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Research Fellowship will benefit the partner organizations The Arts Catalyst, the Nuclear Submarine Forum and the SDP-AG. It will significantly contribute to the learning and development of critical language and present new frameworks for thinking through problems, investigating ethics and aesthetics within these organizations.

The Research will contribute to the curatorial development of the The Arts Catalyst, an established arts agency with a ten year track record of bringing together artists and scientists in rigourous dialogue, to share research, and develop new work. They have played a significant role in supporting artists exploring nuclear issues, and facilitating interdisciplinary discussion on the subject. In 2008, they produced 'Nuclear: Art &amp;amp; Radioactivity', accompanied by the 'Nuclear Forum' which included Paul Dorfman, Kate Hudson at the RSA. In 1998 they produced 'Atomic: James Acord, Carey Young, Mark Waller' an exhibition at ArtLab, Imperial College, London. There is a synergy of research interests between Ele Carpenter and the Arts Catalyst, who have been following each other's curatorial work for several years.

The research will contribute to the language and culture of the The SDP Advisory Group, a forum for conducting independent assessment of initiatives and outcomes, and a route for providing scrutiny, advice and counsel to the Ministry of Defence Submarine Dismantling Project. The SDP-AG includes approximately 25 representatives of statutory regulators, NGOs, academics and community organizations including: British Nuclear Energy Society, Environmental Health Advisory Services Ltd, Institution of Nuclear Engineers, Nuclear Submarine Forum, Nuclear Free Local Authorities and members of the MOD. The SDP-AG has advised on openness and transparency leading to a public information website and ensuring that its meetings are open to the public. The forthcoming public consultation will involve key stakeholders including the SDP-AG and its representative groups. It may also be possible for the Research Fellow to contribute to the consultation. The Research Fellow will work with the NsubF to open up channels of communication for artistic research, providing access and opportunities to new ways of thinking, specific sites and materials. 

The Nuclear Submarine Forum (NsubF) has represented anti-nuclear activists from across the UK on the SDP-AG since its inception in 2000-2001. The NsubF proposed an idea of a public art project to the SDP-AG in July 2010, and invited Ele Carpenter to give a presentation to the group in Birmingham, 23 February 2011. The SDP-AG passed a recommendation to the MOD that they agree to work with Dr Carpenter on an art project. There was general interest in: inviting artists to give presentations prior to SDP-AG meetings, hosting a SDP-AG at Cove Park (an Artists Residency Centre above Faslane), and willingness to help arrange a visit for artists to have a guided tour around a nuclear submarine in Devonport, Plymouth. 

The Research will benefit artists by providing access to institutional networks, information and sites that will enable them to develop an informed practice. It will build relationships between key researchers and practitioners to develop a shared language for developing new projects. The workshop will provide a unique opportunity for artists to develop their critical language, knowledge and expertise.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36524</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Material Nuclear Culture was an exhibition curated by Ele Carpenter for KARST Gallery, Plymouth, presenting new commissions of contemporary artists responses to the physical qualities and material traces of the aesthetics, traditions and legacy of nuclear powered submarines in the UK. Whilst the MOD is currently undertaking a public consultation process on how and where to dismantle and store Britain's old subs the long term problems of storing radioactive waste remain unresolved. The exhibition included new sculptural, film, sound and installation works by David Mabb, Crowe and Rawlinson, Thomson and Craighead and Susan Schuppli. The exhibition situated these new works alongside a poster artwork by Erika Kobayashi exploring the intergenerational effects of radiation between Europe and Japan from the atomic bomb to nuclear accidents; and Kota Takeuchi's recent work on the complexity of monuments and markers along the Fukushima coastline.</gtr:description><gtr:id>00E9D90A-A83C-4736-B5A8-9C82AC01F48C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition took place at KARST Gallery in close proximity to the Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth where several of the Navy's decommissioned nuclear powered submarines are laid up, and due to be dismantled. The Base Commander contacted the gallery on the opening night to officially say that he approved of the exhibition.

The exhibition marked the final year of the Submarine Dismantling Project (SDP) Advisory Group who advised the MOD on the process of dismantling British nuclear submarines for over ten years. The exhibition commemorated the legacy of the Advisory Group process, and their commitment to an open and frank discussion about the issues of radioactive waste management between the MOD, expert advisors, NGO's and statutory agencies. The Chair of the SDP Advisory Group particpated in a round table discussion with submariners, artists and a curator from the William Morris Gallery.

William Morris Tudor Rose fabric (1883) was used in the upholstery of British Royal Navy nuclear powered submarines from c.1961 until 1993. Whilst the traditional English design created a homely feel for the submariners, Morris himself was a committed socialist and revolutionary thinker. Working in partnership with artist David Mabb and The Devonport Naval Base, Ele Carpenter arranged to gift samples of fabrics used on dismantled submarines to the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, and the William Morris Society for preservation and scholarship. Along with artists Nick Crowe, Ian Rawlinson and Susan Schuppli, Ele Carpenter was able to capture audio and film footage of interviews with submariners about the fabric, which have also been gifted to the museum archives. Further curatorial work is needed to develop a museum display using the original materials.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc4e5c572602.58867810</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Material Nuclear Culture, KARST</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://nuclear.artscatalyst.org/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This sculptural installation is presented as a working laboratory for measuring how people perceive low level radiation.

The Arts Catalyst attracted a wide audience of artists working with the sciences, and took care of all the logistics, bookings, travel and acomodation, finances, professional mentoring, documentation, publicity and website for the events. They continue to promote my curatorial research into Nuclear Culture.
During 2012-13 I undertook a residency at Cove Park in Scotland to write about nuclear submarines; took artists to undertake field research at: the Aldermaston Women's Peace Camp; HMS Courageous, decommissioned nuclear submarine in Plymouth; and have a tour of the waste storage site, LLW Ltd, at Drigg in Cumbria.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I undertook my curatorial research fellowship in partnership with the Arts Catalyst who hosted the Nuclear Culture Symposium which included presentations by four members of the Submarine Dismantling Advisory Group (SDP-AG). 

My research with the SDP-AG unformed every stage of the decision making processes involved in bringing together a multi-disciplinary, multi-sector group of expert participants to share their knowledge and develop new forms of discourse around nuclear culture. I selected the speakers, and established continuing working relationships with all the contributors to the conference. I ran a fortnightly Nuclear Culture Reading group with MFA Curating students at Goldsmiths College. The students helped to organise the Symposia and were respondents for the roundtable discussions at the plenary.

Participants were able to think outside of their discipline, and consider a wider context for their work. Workshop participants also attended the 'Nuclear Culture on Film' day of public film screenings, and contributed to a public discussion about art, film, science and nuclear culture.

A programme of artists' films investigating nuclear culture from the perspective of the 21st Century reflecting on 1980s feminist experimental film and activism, gritty dramatic satire of the 1990s, and recent video-essay works from 2009 - 2012. The audience include members of the Submarine Dismantling Advisory Group. 
The programme included films by: Mark Aerial Waller (UK), Isao Hashimoto (Japan), Sandra Lahire (Canada), Otolith Group (UK), Eva and Franco Mattes (USA), Chris Oakley (UK), Yelena Popova (Russia/UK). Artists narrate their own experience of nuclear environments in Britain, the Urals, Estonia, Ukraine, Japan and Canada, travelling back home or to sites of disaster to try and capture the invisible or the unimaginable. Investigating the aesthetic implications of radiation reveals the impossibility of capturing an energy that bleaches the images from film and erases the hard drives of digital devices. The films raised important questions for nuclear critique from nuclear entropy, utopian and dystopian belief systems, questioning scientific certainty, political agency and the proliferation of nuclear culture. Curated by Ele Carpenter with students from MFA Curating, Goldsmiths. The roundtable discussion engaged artists Kodwo Eshun (Otolith Group) and Mark Aerial Waller in conversation with philosopher Liam Sprod, chaired by Susan Kelly.

The roundtable discussion dealt with complex issues of art, science and documentary with a diverse audience from different disciplines. The project developed the Arts Catalyst programme to collaborate with the social as well as the material sciences. The success of the programme led Ele Carpenter to continue to work with the Arts Catalyst to develop the 'Panning for Atomic Gold' Symposium and 'Actinium exhibition, forum and field trips' in 2014; and to present her research at the InSOTEC confere</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54351a8d3cc113.38505105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nuclear.artscatalyst.org/content/nuclear-culture-film</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

My research is now being presented by other academics as an example of curatorial research in Nuclear Culture at humanities and waste management conferences (see Cornelius Holtorf, Towards a Nuclear Studies https://heritage-futures.org/towards-nuclear-cultural-studies-2/). I have been invited by Jonathon Hogg, History, Liverpool Univeristy, to join a planning group for a Nuclear Studies AHRC Research Network bid in 2017. Also in Feb 2017 Jantine Schroeder presented the Perpetual Uncertainty exhibition and artworks to the Records, Knowledge and Memory Meeting in Paris, where it was very well recieved.

Narrative Feedback from SDP-AG members: Working with other disciplines can help to broadened the horizons of the context in which we work, giving people permission to think differently, and speak about concerns that the normative culture of their field doesn't allow space for. It can help to articulate things people already know but don't have the language or support to describe. The arts and humanities can think holistically, they don't need to compartmentalize research-processes and knowledge in the same way as science and engineering. At the same time these disciplines are not homogenous, there are many arts and many sciences. But industry/ research or art/science partnerships often have expectations that art might articulate what is already visible and known, whilst artists might interrogate the interplay of visibility and invisibility both materially and politically in unexpected ways.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2717B4F7-0CDE-4448-B00A-1FF9F0F678C6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5462898cac0107.47036865</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Early Career Research grant provided seed funding for subsequent research findings that include:

The 'round table' model has been taken forward as an effective structure for sharing working practices and developing new conceptual frameworks for understanding nuclear culture, inspired by artist James Acord. This model has been used as the central dialogic method for the nuclear culture project at: Bildmuseet, Sweden; KARST Gallery, Plymouth; Arts Catalyst, London; npo S-Air, Japan; Z33, Belgium. The Nuclear Culture Source Book and website is a resource for artists and curators in the field. The Nuclear Culture project contributes to the debate about considering the impact of radioactive waste on the present and not deferring responsibility for the future. Future projects to be taken forward through the research include developing a context for commissioing new artwork at nuclear sites in the UK and Belgium and applying for funding to write journal papers to articulate how these practices constitute new knowledge and should be funded as research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C771F5DF-053F-4925-9DFE-442EA371E9FC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deb400cf4086.38879696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://nuclear.artscatalyst.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Public Consultation: Submarine Dismantling Project: Interim storage of Intermediate Level radioactive Waste</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8DB647EA-ECA7-4741-B7AB-594DF5980292</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The consultation public consultation infleunced the ministerial announcement on 7 July 2016, that Capenhurst Nuclear Services, Capenhurst, has been selected as the interim storage site for Intermediate Level radioactive Waste (ILW).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54628371181b56.10238023</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/submarine-dismantling-project</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to InSOTEC Stakeholder Seminar, Euratom 7, EU Commision Community Research</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B9233C4F-6357-4B18-A184-849B7BBF52D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The InSOTEC stakeholder seminar (Berlin 2013) was co-funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Euratom Framework Programme for Nuclear Research and Training Activities (2007-2011).

InSOTEC aims to generate a better understanding of the complex interplay between the technical and the social in radioactive waste management and, in particular, in the design and implementation of geological disposal. InSOTEC broadens the stream of socio-political research on radioactive waste management to include research on social aspects of science and technology in this matter and on the technical translation of socio-political requirements.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc3ed3cddcf3.02689161</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.insotec.eu/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>My curatorial 'research' investigates the relationship between theory and practice within contemporary interdisciplinary nuclear discourses. To articulate this process, I am developing a Curatorial Research Methodology based on the following principles: Holistic, Embedded, Long term, Interdisciplinary, Discursive. The Research Methods include established research tools such as: Field research, Residencies, Dialogue, Commissioning, Exhibitions, Film screenings, Publishing, etc. Whilst this approach is established in socially engaged art practice, it is rarely articulated within Curatorial practice. My approach creates new knowledge through commissioing contemporary art and curatorial discourse, to reach further into inter-disciplinary contexts and new fields of thought. This is distinct from the tradiational Arthistorical model for curatorial research which uses curating as a tool for display rather than as a form of knowledge production.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0EBA7C1D-4AD2-41E5-958B-6554A5768D03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The long term research partnerships across different disciplines, published and exhibition impacts, outlined in this report are all evidence of an integrated socially engaged approach to practice-based Curatorial Research contributing new knowledge to the European discourse on long term waste management.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b7fa18629810.50909752</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Practice Based Curatorial Research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>24ABDB04-8E24-4089-8004-56A65654FE51</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nuclear Culture Symposium Report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b2b055aa856a3a2d87e4992e09d8b2f"><gtr:id>0b2b055aa856a3a2d87e4992e09d8b2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carpenter, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546280234a8bf1.93485288</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FE038B5F-A453-4DA2-A823-1A29AD6A5C9D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cold War Legacies Systems, Theory, Aesthetics</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b2b055aa856a3a2d87e4992e09d8b2f"><gtr:id>0b2b055aa856a3a2d87e4992e09d8b2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carpenter, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>ISBN 9781474409483</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>580a2752589265.41622262</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A619C595-5C18-43D0-A96E-E25DB8F04F08</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nuclear Anthropocene</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b2b055aa856a3a2d87e4992e09d8b2f"><gtr:id>0b2b055aa856a3a2d87e4992e09d8b2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carpenter, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546280b2905b07.21967710</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6D16FE51-96B6-4E27-99CF-E1421873DD0B</gtr:id><gtr:title>X-10 Power in the Land</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad95de6a9149d353e08cb1559dda7eab"><gtr:id>ad95de6a9149d353e08cb1559dda7eab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carpenter E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-78280-7322-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56cb3169cdab94.24385807</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J005746/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A41F90B5-A81F-42AC-908A-49DB7154F85A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art Theory &amp; Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp; Sound Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
