Biology uses various types of protein to pass signals around a cell, allowing the cell to respond to its environment. One such signalling mechanism is the addition of a phosphate group to a protein, and this process is carried out by a class of proteins called 'kinases'. Some diseases, including cancer, can come about in part because the signalling mechanism in a cell has become faulty, for example telling it to grow when it should not. Because of this, kinase enzymes are an attractive target for new drugs. Medicinal chemists are designing small molecules that can shut down specific kinases, and therefore prevent their signal from being passed on. This has the potential to switch off the broken signalling mechanisms in a diseased cell. Unfortunately, measuring the activity of a kinase is not straightforward, so it is a difficult and time-consuming process to know whether or not a new drug will be effective at inhibiting a specific kinase. We will help to solve this problem by developing a molecule that will act as a reporter of how active a given kinase is, therefore speeding up the process of searching for kinase inhibitors. This reporter molecule will work in a unique way: it will change shape when a kinase adds a phosphate group to it, and the change in shape will bring about a fluorescent signal that can be detected with standard laboratory instruments. This is possible because the reporter molecule is a 'peptide', built from the same building blocks as the proteins that the kinase would normally add a phosphate group to. The sensor will work because it has a central core that can exist in two distinct shapes: one stretched out, and one in which the molecule is folded back on itself. When it doesn't have a phosphate group, the sensor will exist predominantly in the stretched out state. When the kinase adds a phosphate group to it, however, the sensor will fold back on itself so that it can wrap around the phosphate group. This folded form will bring two special fluorescent groups close together in space, allowing them to produce a signal that can be easily detected with standard lab instruments. The result of this is that the amount of signal produced by the sensor will depend on the ability of the kinase to add a phosphate group to it. This means that a scientist will be able to conduct a screen where they look for small molecules that inhibit a kinase simply by looking for conditions in which the kinase is prevented from switching the sensor to the 'on' state. Rapid screens of this sort are vitally important in the search for new drugs because the number of potential drug molecules is huge. In the case of kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer it is also necessary to consider that the kinases themselves can mutate, causing a cancer to become resistant to a drug. By speeding up the screening process it will become possible to search for new drugs more quickly, and to better understand how changes to individual kinases can affect their response to existing drugs. This will help clinicians to tailor their treatments to a patient's specific illness- so called 'personalised healthcare'. In the case of cancer this will help doctors to be one step ahead of the mutations that can cause a tumour to become drug resistant, allowing them to make better informed choices of which drugs to use, resulting in more-effective treatments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of this research will be realised through the development of a new assay for the activity of kinase enzymes. This will have a direct effect on the search for new therapeutic agents in the academic, charitable, and private sectors. This sensor will be compatible with high-throughput assays in standard fluorescence plate readers, and will therefore be available to a wide swath of the scientific community, and will be both better and more economical than existing methods. This research has been deliberately focused on kinases that are well-understood, soluble, have significant disease relevance, and have commercially available inhibitors. In order to maximise primary impacts, the final work package of this programme will demonstrate the practical effectiveness of this sensor in characterising these kinase/inhibitor systems in a high-throughput format. This will help to generate new collaborations with academic, charitable and industrial partners. Beyond the primary focus of cancer, the modular nature of this sensor will allow it to be readily generalised to other kinases, resulting in impacts in other research areas such as diabetes or inflammatory illnesses. Ultimately, variants of this sensor could be used to detect other hard-to-quantify post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, methylation and acetylation, all of which have significant medical relevance.

The highly multidisciplinary work described here will generate impacts by linking together subject areas that would mutually benefit from more collaboration. For example, many of the concepts demonstrated in the field of molecular machines have yet to find useful application in other subject areas. This work will address this shortcoming by demonstrating a simple molecular device with direct utility in an important field. Other links between subject areas will be strengthened, including that between computational chemistry and chemical biology. This work will demonstrate the benefits of closely coupling the computational and experimental aspects of research into biomolecular structure and function, and in doing so will encourage closer collaboration between researchers in these areas. In practical terms, these links will be forged by making this work available and accessible to researchers in all relevant fields, for example by making experimental protocols and data freely available to interested parties. Where appropriate, physical samples of the sensor will also be shared in order to establish collaborations.

Molecular machines are a fascinating topic that has the potential to excite and engage public interest, this, coupled to the target of helping to fight diseases such as cancer, mean that the work described here will constitute an excellent platform for public engagement activities. The City of Glasgow is well-provided with opportunities to engage with the public, including the Glasgow Science Festival, run by the University of Glasgow. In addition, the Pint of Science festival is well established in Glasgow, and provides an excellent platform for lively and entertaining public engagement activities. ART has already been in contact with the organisers of Pint of Science, and will develop a public engagement talk based around molecular machines to be delivered at the Pint of Science festival, as well as other science festivals around the UK, where possible.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98151</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R00899X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
