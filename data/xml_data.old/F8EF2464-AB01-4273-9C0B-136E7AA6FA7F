Although little can be done in the short term to prevent a drought, actions can be taken to reduce the vulnerability of society to the event, including the development of drought monitoring and early warning (M&amp;amp;EW) systems. There have been few attempts to assess how relevant widely-used physical indicators are for capturing drought severity in a way that reflects the complexity of inter-related human and environmental causes, effects and impacts, and such impacts have not been adequately incorporated into existing drought M&amp;amp;EW systems. This project seeks to fill this gap by improving the conceptual and methodological link between natural (hydrometeorological) drought characterisation and environmental and socio-economic impacts, in order to inform the development of enhanced drought M&amp;amp;EW systems and other risk management strategies. An innovative methodological approach will combine the use of hydro-meteorological and socio-economic data, including impact reports, alongside social learning approaches designed to incorporate stakeholders' views and experiences of drought. The team will use existing datasets of drought indices typically incorporated in monitoring systems, but also extensive, yet under-utilized, databases on drought impacts (US Drought Reporter, EU project DROUGHT R&amp;amp;SPI database). In a series of workshops with water suppliers and other stakeholders, the applicability of M&amp;amp;EW systems will be explored in strategy games and the results will feed back into analysis and design. This approach will support the iterative development of novel approaches for targeted M&amp;amp;EW for the case study sector of public water supply. The direct involvement of some partners in operational drought monitoring and robust assessment of the potentials and opportunities under different prerequisites will guarantee the project's impact and thus help move towards the goal of developing new practices enabling communities to build capacity for resilience to drought.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The DrIVER research will generate a number of different outcomes which will benefit a range of users, some of whom will be engaged directly and benefit directly, and others who will benefit indirectly. Overall, DrIVER has the potential to impact the way we think about and 'do' water science, water management, education and learning strategies, policy development and most importantly transform aspects of drought resilience among communities.

In terms of organizations involved in monitoring, CEH currently hosts the UK National Hydrological Monitoring Programme, a UK-wide focus for drought (and water resources) and also has strong links with the Environment Agency, who conduct appraisals of the water situation in England and Wales and whose responsibility it is to actively manage droughts in those countries. The engagement of CEH in DriVER would thus ensure that future developments in UK drought and water resources monitoring could benefit directly from the findings of DriVER as they develop, and would also ensure that the benefits could reach the other organizations involved in drought management and M&amp;amp;EW in the UK and internationally via these partnerships. 

Indirect impacts are expected for M&amp;amp;EW services elsewhere in Europe. The pan-European Drought Observatory by JRC aimed at developing M&amp;amp;EW will also benefit strongly from the synthesis of existing M&amp;amp;EW systems. The cross-country collaboration in DrIVER will ensure that UK and European research and practice benefits from the learning experiences of M&amp;amp;EW in the US and Australia, which already have large-scale M&amp;amp;EW systems. Both these outcomes will be of high utility for further development of more cohesive strategies for M&amp;amp;EW on a large-scale in Europe. 

DriVER also has major policy impact potential. DriVER comes at an important time in the UK when the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs is reviewing its abstraction licencing policy and designing its future research plans in environmental flows (work being led by CEH). Likewise CEH played a lead role in the freshwater component of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, which highlighted the importance of ecosystem processes, functions and services to economic, social and environmental security, and has underpinned UK government environmental policy. DriVER will also enable this work to be extended to cover environmental risk and management during droughts that can be integrated with the development of M&amp;amp;EW systems. 

A range of national and local level stakeholders and regulators will also be involved in the social learning events (workshops) and processes associated with Task 3 in particular. The various stakeholders involved directly in the DrIVER research will benefit from their involvement in the workshops and associated activities specified. The workshop design is intentionally not 'extractive' in the more usual sense of researchers extracting information from stakeholders. Instead, we see stakeholders as being part of the learning process (rather than just information store). This will give stakeholders a more positive and proactive role and can contribute, as part of a wider collaborative learning community, to improved policy and practice. We expect each workshop will consist of the following stakeholders: central government (Defra), the water supply companies, regulators (Environment Agency), Natural England, National Farmers Union, River Community Groups and River Trusts, Canal and Rivers Trust, local NGOs. Where possible, we will also invite individual stakeholders who have a clear interest or contribution to understanding drought in the local context. A better-informed public should also lead to a better-informed decision/policy maker. 

The fact that our data and value-added information will be made available freely through our web portal, and those of our partners, should allow for transparency that fosters and empowers our constituents.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242339</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Hydrological Society Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B70E485-A4C6-4F75-AF91-68D7D614398E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to the BHS International Conference at Cranfield, September 2016.

The main goals for this workshop included:
To present updates related to the above research objectives. These included updates from the project's international partners from Australia and the United Kingdom. 
Getting localized stakeholder feedback on specific outcomes and potential uses of data related to drought indicator to impact information.

Sessions:
The workshop was organized into three main sessions. The first one was focused on drought impacts and how the information can be better packaged for state drought advisors and local water utilities. The others were related to quantifying drought indicator and impact relationships, in which these research outcomes helped set the stage for the potential development of drought scenarios that includes impact data.

Stakeholder Engagement
20 stakeholders that represented a state drought advisory role, local water utilities, and private consulting were in attendance. There were three post feedback periods for 30-45 minutes each after each research session. The first and third sessions used conversation mapping, where each participant had the opportunity to add to the large sheet a paper an idea related to 1-2 central questions. The second session used a question and answer format, while the third session built onto the first session related to the usage of drought impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2a9a86ae756.43837569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CIWEM National Water Resources Panel</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA348C35-1CFB-493D-A30E-0B2908D7A559</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jamie Hannaford was invited speaker at the CIWEM national water resources panel.

For the U.S. water supply case study, the project team engaged community water suppliers and state, federal and private advisors in the Neuse and Cape Fear River basins in North Carolina. The goal of this initial &amp;quot;knowledge sharing&amp;quot; workshop, which took place on December 9, 2014 in Durham, North Carolina, was to share experiences and identify needs related to drought, its impacts, and the role of drought M&amp;amp;EW.

Workshop participants expressed similar needs in regards to enhancing drought monitoring, preparedness and response. General needs included:
##An increase in stream and ground water monitoring stations, local precipitation measurements, and customer water demand data collection to provide more data for drought impact assessment, identifying management triggers, modeling and general decision making
##User-friendly hydro-climatological outlooks from season to annual timescales
##Better local drought impact collection, archiving and reporting systems
##Better probabilistic models and/or scenarios (especially in terms of integrating land use, climate change, and customer water demand data) for producing enhanced hydrologic forecasts and demand projections
##Studies to better assess correlations between the range of drought products/indices (e.g., U.S. Drought Monitor, etc.) and local water supply-related indicators and impacts for their potential use in M&amp;amp;EW and coordination with state government in declaring drought conditions
##Studies to better assess the links between local water-related drought impacts, indicators and management triggers to ensure that impacts are being addressed appropriately in water suppliers' Water Shortage Response Plans
##Additional activities to test the ability of water suppliers' Water Shortage Response Plans to respond to drought quickly and effectively
##Enhanced education, communication, and collaboration before, during, and after drought to share research results and best practice information; engage a broad group of managers, customers and the media; develop consistent educational programs and drought-related messages; and ultimately reduce drought vulnerability and risk.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb88049bf115.16104189</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Peter Wolf Symposium 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>39A788AB-F029-4AE4-9CF0-51F06C91F7E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lucy Barker presented on the DrIVER project at the 2015 British Hydrological Society Peter Wolf Symposium for early career hydrologists.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb88d7e6acc5.83648551</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RMETS/NCAS Conference Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F8B2CD7-9761-410F-BB4D-04B65BDFF98F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a workshop held at the RMETS/NCAS Annual Conference held in Manchester, under the theme &amp;quot;High impact weather and climate&amp;quot;.

While most of the analysis and engagement has been finalised, many of the key findings are still only just being published, and the main impacts now being realised. A brief summary of the current situation follows.

Drought monitoring and early warning (M&amp;amp;EW) systems and their integration into drought risk management can reduce society's vulnerability to drought. To date, M&amp;amp;EW systems employ mostly physical drought indicator variables, e.g. precipitation deficit. Few attempts have been made to assess how such indicators reflect the complexity of inter-related human and environmental causes, effects and impacts. This was the starting point for DrIVER.

DrIVER's objectives and related outcomes: 

(1) to compare and evaluate reported drought impacts and physical drought indicators where drought M&amp;amp;EW systems exist and are used. DrIVER found that index choices used operationally are mostly guided by data availability; indices on meteorological and agricultural drought are more frequently monitored than hydrological drought and socio-economic or environmental impacts. 

(2) aimed to identify and compare thresholds of drought indicators that define the vulnerability of society, ecosystem services and economy in order to better understand the coupled system. Quantitative analyses explored vulnerability thresholds for different impacted sectors and found differences such as agriculture impacts occurring with less delay to the meteorological indicator than water supply impacts; for different regions depending on a particular water supply source, such as surface vs. groundwater; for different drought stages such as onset, peak, termination. River ecosystems alter in response to drought but are resilient and can recover. 

Objective (3) was to explore through a series of workshops the capacity of stakeholders, in particular water supply companies, to make drought management decisions. Despite regional differences, stakeholders decision-making was often found to be directed by specific drought plans and organizational requirements setting trigger levels depending on asset states and demand. Although drought impacts were recognized, they were not easily incorporated into decision-making due to a lack of suitable indicators and confidence in reliability. Water management decisions such as drought mitigation measures can also modify the thresholds found in (2). While DRiVER research explored stakeholder decision-making and framings of drought in context, a more detailed assessment of feedbacks with impacts and management decisions is needed. 

Objective (4) was to outline pathways to drought resilience based on improved drought M&amp;amp;EW systems to make the necessary link between natural drivers, impacts, drought management and training. High awareness was found among stakeholders about the complex web of impacts. Lacking however is the knowledge about interactions and tools to analyse these and react. Historical analogues and index-impact scenarios were found to be a promising research avenue for resilience building. Reported impacts can be linked to the indicators statistically. DrIVER tested the potential of such empirically derived 'impact functions' and found that where sufficient impact reports are available, the impact function approach could be used to add the likelihood of impact occurrence to the commonly used indices provided by M&amp;amp;EW.

Additional efforts are needed to better monitor and report drought impacts at the local level to provide higher resolution information and better correlations with hydro-meteorological drought indicators. This would also enhance the tracking of drought impacts over time as a result of changing social/ecological dynamics and management strategies that are implemented to reduce drought impacts. 

DrIVER work elucidated the links between drought indicators and drought impacts in the case study regions specifically and generally clarified the current state and future potential of drought impact monitoring and prediction. Stakeholder knowledge, qualitative analysis and quantitative modelling showed that commonly used drought index values' meaning as useful indicators and drought mitigation measure triggers changes during an event and over time due to management decisions and adaptation. Stakeholder engagement helped reveal these findings and informed consequent options for implementation into drought monitoring and early warning. Difference in this implementation potential arise from different governance structures in the case studies.

Some additional highlights specific to the UK at the present stage (March 2017) include:

- Engagement with a wide range of stakeholders suggests an appetite for improved 'impact-focused' M&amp;amp;EW systems in the UK, using consistent indicators to help consistency of messaging.

- Different stakeholders have very different framings of the issue of drought, which have an influence on their requirements for monitoring and early warning; M&amp;amp;EW systems need to accommodate this in their design.

- We have tested comprehensively, for the first time, standardized drought indicators for use in M&amp;amp;EW the UK. We have provided guidance as to their suitability and the best statistical formulation for testing them. We have used these indicators to shed light on drought variability in the UK, and the propagation of drought from rainfall to river flow. Both these advances have been published and we anticipate they will be useful for researchers and practitioners alike who wish to use these tools in the UK. In addition, they are of international significance; while standardized indicators have been applied occasionally to river flows in the literature, our use of them is one of the most expansive and comprehensive tests and we make recommendations for application which could be relevant in many other environments. 

- Jointly with colleagues at U. Freiburg, we have explored the link between drought indicators and drought impacts in the UK, and made comparisons with Germany using novel statistical methods. We demonstrated that impact databases have much potential for appraising the suitability of different drought indicators for use in early warning. Different indicators work well for different types of impacts (e.g. water supply, agriculture) and it is rarely possible to find indicator 'thresholds' that consistently predict impacts. However, the work paves the way for using impacts data in a systematic and rigorous way to guide M&amp;amp;EW system design.

- In collaboration with National Capability funded CEH data scientists, we have delivered a prototype new monitoring and early warning system, the CEH Drought Portal that is based on DrIVER data and design. We released the portal firstly as a way of exploring historic datasets. We have since developed the portal further into an operational tool which will be released soon. We have worked with stakeholders to get their feedback on the portal and its potential uses.

- we have tested drought indicators based on earth observation data at the European scale, and released the indicators as an Open Dataset.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>DrIVER work has informed and directly initiated the implementation of new features into existing Monitoring and Early Warning Systems, e.g.:

- UK Drought Portal: datasets implemented and visualisation options
- UK 'HydEOmex' portal, a demonstrator for Earth Observation based monitoring; exploys key DrIVER outputs. 
- North Carolina: new visualisation and analysis options for comparison with impacts in their monitoring system
- Australia: an article in 'The Conversation' created debate about the degree of consideration of impacts in monitoring and early warning

There is significant opportunity to build on the findings - we plan to continue analysing the new datasets, developing the portal and continuing the stakeholder engagement, so the project is not finished yet. But we envisage that other researchers and practitioners will be able to use the outcomes, especially:

- Use of the Drought portal in research and practice
- use of the many datasets of drought indicators we have developed and published as open data
- use of our recommendations for drought indicator applications in future
- use of the UK Droughts impact database we have delivered
- learning from our stakeholder co-enquiries for future stakeholdfer co-design of M&amp;amp;EW systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>212F6275-1323-4952-89EE-2B718E873BED</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd328b59b313.55072555</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.drought.uni-freiburg.de/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Gridded Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) using generalised logistic distribution with standard period 1961-2010 for Great Britain [SPEIgenlog61-10].

- the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) based on satellite product NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index);
- the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) based on remotely sensed LST (Land Surface Temperature);
- the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) which is a combination of VCI and TCI.

These three drought indicators have been extracted for European NUTS regions (level 0, 1, 2 and 3). These have been masked with a land use land cover map to be able to study different responses for various land cover types. A simplified LULC was created, with only four classes: forest, crop, shrub and grass.
