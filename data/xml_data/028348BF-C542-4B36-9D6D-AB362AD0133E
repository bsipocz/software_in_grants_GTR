The welfare of consumers and nations is strongly affected by financial decisions large and small; whether that is choosing a mortgage, saving for retirement, borrowing to fund current consumption or protecting oneself from financial risks. Financial services are largely intangible, high in experience and high in credence qualities. The implications for consumers are that financial services, particularly complex financial services, are difficult to grasp mentally, there are limited opportunities for learning due to infrequent interaction with providers, information asymmetries between consumers and financial services providers require individuals to depend on experts, thereby creating the need for trust. Risk and uncertainty are inherent to many financial decisions. Not surprisingly, under these conditions consumers are often poorly informed and susceptible to making poor decisions that not only have significant personal consequences but also societal consequences. 

In the wake of the financial crisis consumer confidence and trust in financial services has been affected. Governments globally have responded to rebuild the financial services industry. The UK FSA is focused on building a &amp;quot;reformed, fair and competitive&amp;quot; industry. The seminar series offers a timely opportunity to discuss the issues and challenges facing consumers in the context of recent and on-going regulatory and policy developments in the financial services industry, including among other things the establishment of a new Financial Conduct Authority, the Retail Distribution Review, and pensions auto-enrolment. These developments are aimed at benefitting consumers from fairer treatment, tougher conduct regulation, better sales practices, access to more financial information and advice, and greater engagement with retirement saving. However, the full effect of these developments is still to be felt on consumers. 

Set against this context the seminar series will provide an opportunity to discuss from various perspectives the issues and challenges facing consumers in making financial decisions. Understanding the issues and challenges facing consumers in the context of financial services is both a theoretical and practical task. Drawing on the latest research in financial services decision-making the seminars will provide an opportunity to discuss and offer insights into the extent to which recent and planned regulatory and policy developments are expected to achieve the desired aims of enabling consumers to take a responsible approach to personal finance, the extent to which they are empowering consumers and building capacity, and the extent to which they are able to support and protect consumers in dealing with decisions that are inherently risky and uncertain.

The seminar series is designed to explore the interconnections between three main themes: (1) consumer financial literacy, capacity and experience in making financial decisions, (2) the financial advice and guidance landscape and regulatory structure supporting and protecting consumer financial decisions, and (3) the role of new media and technology in supporting and enabling decision-making, including the potential to empower, include or exclude certain groups. The seminar series will bring together people working in each of these areas to explore the issues and challenges facing financial services consumers and potential solutions to supporting and protecting consumers.

The central aim of the seminar series is to look holistically at the issues facing financial services consumers in the context of change with a view to: 

-creating new knowledge and building research capacity, particularly for early career researchers; 
-exchanging knowledge and fostering collaboration by promoting dialogue and interchange between academics, policy makers and practitioners;
-disseminating the outputs from the seminar series to the widest audience possible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Regulators and policymakers will gain insights into the ways in which financial services consumers have responded or are likely to respond to recent and planned developments in regulation and policy aimed at consumers. Current policies will be evaluated using rigorous evidence based research, and on-going developments will be informed by an enhanced understanding of what is effective and where challenges exist. The seminar series will bring together research on the current and likely future impact of consumer financial literacy and education programmes, the information and advice landscape post Retail Distribution Review, and levels of trust in the industry and attendant behavioural impacts. 
Organisations and associations that champion the financial services consumer voice, such as the Financial Services Consumer Panel will benefit from hearing about the latest research on the nature of financial services consumer attitudes and behaviour. This will provide insights into the factors affecting financial services behaviour, including psychological and social factors, the interactions between trust, confidence, knowledge and behaviour, also in how attitudes and behaviours are changing in the current climate and how best to respond to support consumers in making financial services decisions. Insights will assist in understanding how best to support and protect consumers, especially vulnerable consumers, and can add weight to the work in support of consumer protection.
Practitioners will benefit in particular from insights that inform them of how consumers form perceptions of trust and fairness in financial institutions and how such perceptions are likely to influence consumer behaviour. They will also gain an insight into how to measure such perceptions accurately and how to compare their performance to relevant industry benchmarks.
Journalists can gain a greater understanding of the issues and challenges facing consumers of financial services and the recent and likely future impact of regulatory and policy developments: for example, on the impact of the advice landscape on consumers' capacity to make informed responsible financial decisions and the impact of the Financial Conduct Authority on its ability to protect consumers from further mis-selling and malpractice.
From an early stage user groups have been represented in the design of the seminar series through discussions with ifs School of Finance and via Professor Devlin's Directorship of the Financial Services Research Forum. We have also researched the key priorities of the FSA and the Financial Services Consumer Panel to ensure that the seminar themes accord with their key priorities and thus will be of interest and relevance to the wider financial services industry.
Drawing on our personal contacts and experience and the considerable networks available to us via ifs School of Finance and the Financial Services Research Forum we will ensure that non-academic beneficiaries are well represented at the seminars. Non-academic beneficiaries will be invited as audience or panel participants. Panel discussions at the end of each seminar will be used to contextualise the research findings for user communities, to increase usability and to ensure meaningful impact. We will identify key issues and insights arising and use these as the basis for dissemination in the form of bulletins via the website.
We can also use the database and contacts at ifs School of Finance and FSRF. The FSRF has a network of over 200 affiliates from the commercial, policymaking and third sectors and a website that we can use for dissemination. The Forum also runs a LinkedIn Group, a blog with regular posts and a twitter feed that we can use to advertise the seminar series. The production of an edited book is also likely to be of interest to non-academic users. Practitioner journals, such as Financial World, Chartered Banker, Securities and Investment Review can be used to reach non-academic users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Money Advice Service</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C213E1E7-4FA0-43D8-89B0-148EE9E1F99B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to MAS on &amp;quot;Mind the gap: Past and present financial socialization of emerging adults in the UK&amp;quot;, The Money Advice Service helps people manage their money.

This forms part of the UK Financial Capability Strategy. Based on findings presented at the seminar, the Money Advice Service commissioned Harrison and Marchant to conduct a 'deep dive' into the young adult data from the UK Financial Capability Survey. Further qualitative insights were provided from the data presented at the seminar and from new qualitative data gathered to understand the opportunities for engaging young adults in financial management. The recommendations made, which include engaging employers and other key agents, are being taken forward by the Money Advice Service. The key findings from the research, in relation to gender and confidence, are also being taken forward as key discussion themes at the forthcoming Money Advice Service's Financial Capability Conference on 17th November 2016 (as part of MAS's first Financial Capability Week). The research identified three young adult segments, Planners, Dreamers, Drifters, with different propensities for planning and money management. On the basis of this, the Money Advice Service has developed a quiz for young adults to understand which segment they fall into and is using the outcome to provide targeted guidance to support young people with the underlying characteristics.

Based on findings from research presented by Harrison and Waite at the seminars, Waite and Harrison were invited to lead a session in a programme of events funded by the Scottish Universities Insight Institute. The session was based on the findings of research into Digital Empowerment. Waite and Harrison led a session &amp;quot;Delivering on Membership Value&amp;quot; as part of the subsequent workshop series (Financing the Future: achieving sustainable growth in credit unions). The session drew on findings from the ESRC seminar series presentation and examined how these could be taken forward into product development and adoption of digital delivery to serve the needs of credit union members and facilitate credit union development. The research influenced the development of the Scottish Credit Union Charter (launched 2/10/15 by Association of British Credit Unions (ABCUL). The charter commits signatories to five policy interventions designed to make Scotland a Credit Union Nation. 

The same research by Harrison and Waite on digital empowerment formed the basis for an invited presentation by Waite to the LITE conference in Edinburgh (the UK's largest education technology conference), bringing together people from across the training and education spectrum for two days of Learning, Innovation, Technology and Evolution. The research received interest from Nicola Turing of the Turing Trust who commented: &amp;quot;Your talk in particular is so relevant in convincing the teachers and students in the ICCES to embrace different ways of learning and working so that they really maximise the benefit from having access to computers.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1DF2019F-5C12-4604-AAA6-76023F6CC6A3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ccda0f4c1ff7.04944753</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series has:
? Identified new research agendas and opportunities for future research collaboration, building on the networks developed. In particular, the seminar series has identified new research agendas around four grand challenges: achieving financial inclusion; improving consumer capability, confidence and literacy; rebuilding and protecting trust; using digital technology to enhance the user experience. Within these key challenges a number of new and important research questions have been identified. In relation to achieving financial inclusion the series has shown that there is much research already into excluded groups. With the possible exception of the 'self-excluded', there is little value in conducting more research into understanding who is excluded and why (as this is generally known). What is needed is research that addresses solutions to financial exclusion, focusing on the translation of research into activity. In terms of financial capability, the series has shown that education alone is insufficient in increasing financial capability. A blended approach of education plus supported 'just-in-time' information/advice and interventions to 'nudge' behavioural change is needed. The series has also highlighted young adults as a particular group where there has been a lack of attention in terms of financial education/capability and potential vulnerability. In relation to rebuilding and protecting trust, key questions arising relate to the role of the wider stakeholder system in trust building. This is also linked to other challenges of inclusion and financial capability. In terms of technology there are important questions concerning the role of technology as an enabler. Much technological development has benefited the providers. More interesting though is the role for technology in widening access, increasing capacity and empowerment. Gamification is an emerging area in financial services. Research is needed to understand the impact of this on consumer engagement in financial decision making and capacity building. A book is being developed around the four grand challenges.
? Provided an opportunity for early career researchers to network, present and build research capacity. Each seminar provided opportunity to early career researchers to take part and network with experienced academics and practitioners. Additionally, an early career researcher seminar was held to provide a dedicated opportunity for presentation of research that was supported by a series of keynote capacity building presentations on getting published, managing the academic career and getting the most out of conferences. From this, an early career journal special issue is in development from the series.
? Brought together academics, practitioners and policy makers to discuss critical issues and challenges facing consumers of financial services. There was a high level of participation by professionals from the financial services community, policy makers and the third sector. Additionally, a financial industry expert panel discussion facilitated by a BBC Broadcaster, attended by over 50 people, highlighted important and new research questions under the grand challenges themes.
? Identified the application of a new research method, the use of i-poems, a technique constructed from a close reading of narrative data designed to trace how participants speak about themselves in the narrative stories they tell of their lived experiences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are being taken forward in at least four main ways:
1. Findings on financial inclusion and technology use have been taken forward as part of a further funded Scottish Universities Insight Institute impact grant that involve the development of 3 practical KE workshops for credit union practitioners and culminated in a debate at the Scottish Parliament on the future of credit unions.
2. The network developed as part of the series has resulted in new research collaborations and projects (in particular on trust rebuilding and financial wellbeing in older age, building on the ideas developed as part of the series. 
3. Findings are being taken forward as part of published works. An edited research volume is in planning with Routledge, focusing on the four grand challenges identified.
4. The findings on financial capability and advice are being taken forward in further work with the Money Advice Service to better understand young people's need for financial information and advice as part of the UK Financial Capability Strategy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>36D82187-9B30-4A97-B85B-D37EC64A4DC6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56aa39c9ee0820.41125126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/research/clusters/marketing/financial-services-and-consumers-seminar-series#_tabs-2-1</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D78A8627-79F4-4416-A391-A2D3002E2556</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mind the Gap: Young Adult Financial Capability</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Financial Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/374de8780558c4373759de84f53d0ffe"><gtr:id>374de8780558c4373759de84f53d0ffe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harrison T.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7bfa369fd79.90990979</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4598CA3A-86D7-47A3-8077-A6E0D6596199</gtr:id><gtr:title>Financial Literacy and the Limits of Financial Decision Making</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9e157f1d8a77b1431ed1e280f16f6d0b"><gtr:id>9e157f1d8a77b1431ed1e280f16f6d0b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harrison, T.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56a75582a10c45.54374056</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FED3A18-1660-4773-96A9-B7A8A81089D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Natives are Restless</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Financial World</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d810cf7412a8341b3704803f14522dc3"><gtr:id>d810cf7412a8341b3704803f14522dc3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Antony Gandy</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>563ccdaeb588c7.89941105</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6DAA56D8-6CE5-4DC6-8323-90B773BF2D2B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Young Adults Financial Capability</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/374de8780558c4373759de84f53d0ffe"><gtr:id>374de8780558c4373759de84f53d0ffe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harrison T.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c4eb9947f2.56937676</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000504/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0E99303-35B5-4458-9B00-D93E2E075C9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Finance and Accounting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
