Investigative techniques combining epidemiology, evolutionary biology and laboratory techniques (phylodynamics) require development and will be strengthened through building upon methodologies used in localised studies. Tools will be investigated that enable measurement of the extent that homosexual men, who have recently been infected with HIV, are transmitting their infection onwards, relative to homosexual men with longstanding HIV infections. If recently infected HIV-positive men are substantially contributing to onward HIV transmission at a population level, then HIV testing promotion will have limited success as a prevention intervention, since recently infected HIV-positive men will not yet have had the opportunity to have their HIV infection diagnosed. Additionally, the impact of specific groups (such as homosexual men and heterosexuals born-abroad) on the UK population of HIV sequences will be measured and allow prevention efforts to be better targeted. Transmission and spread of drug resistance will be monitored and information on associated risk factors collected. The creation of this resource and the information yielded may have a large impact on the prevention efforts targeted at the UK HIV epidemic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose an epidemiological and virological collaboration between three institutions: the Health Protection Agency, UCL and the University of Oxford. On a large scale, we plan to explore the value of integrating laboratory data from two major new sources together with key epidemiological data at an individual level, in order to study important questions about HIV transmission nationally. In recent years widespread sequence based antiretroviral resistance testing (based on routinely sequencing up to 1000 bases of the HIV genome) has generated a wealth of sequence data. This has great potential for contributing to the understanding of the evolution and epidemiology of the HIV epidemic in the UK. Application of a laboratory technique called the Serological Test Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) has become established as a means for measuring HIV incidence. Use of this test on small aliquots of either diagnostic or anonymised stored serum specimens allows HIV infections to be categorised as either recently acquired or long-standing. Epidemiological information is linkable to the majority of new HIV infections diagnosed in the UK through voluntary clinician and laboratory reports. The synthesis of this information and the development of a phylodynamic approach (integration of phylogenetic and epidemiology) has the potential to generate information about HIV transmission and highlight areas of public health importance.

 Through establishing and implementing methods of linking sequence data to routine epidemiological information, an epidemiological-virological database will be created. The HIV sequences will be classified into either recent or relatively long-standing infections across exposure categories. A suitable phylogenetic method will be developed in an attempt to quantify the extent that recently acquired HIV infections may be attributable to other recently acquired HIV infections relative to longstanding HIV infections. The suitability of these methods for application to the national sequence/epidemiological database will be assessed. Through collaborative projects, the national sequence database will also be used to identify and tackle several important public health questions such as measuring the rate at which novel HIV lineages are appearing in the UK homosexual male population, and exploring the heterosexual spread of non-subtype B viruses, both of which are issues of immense importance for guiding future preventative measures. The creation of this database and the information yielded may have a profound impact on the public health response to the UK HIV epidemic and will be an important resource in future studies of the transmission dynamics of HIV infection.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152832</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FA997D8F-E182-451F-9A64-A559782744F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phylogenetic reconstruction of transmission events from individuals with acute HIV infection: toward more-rigorous epidemiological definitions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of infectious diseases</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e24cf61836ef00a6a7a928569727da58"><gtr:id>e24cf61836ef00a6a7a928569727da58</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown AE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1899</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>DF17A4F4C13</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>82DBF423-1F41-4D06-B241-2D75D503F6F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Implications for HIV testing policy derived from combining data on voluntary confidential testing with viral sequences and serological analyses.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sexually transmitted infections</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e24cf61836ef00a6a7a928569727da58"><gtr:id>e24cf61836ef00a6a7a928569727da58</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown AE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1368-4973</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>271315C6E0A</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G106/1219</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>9A8BEDCC-D902-4C9A-8CCF-C974265EA3FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.4  Surveillance and distribution</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93C4699B-9E5C-4982-9CCC-EFD5B9712D6E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.6  Resources and infrastructure (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
