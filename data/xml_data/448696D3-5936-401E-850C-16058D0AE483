The referendum offers the possibility of meaningful constitutional change, as well as a key departure in terms of the electoral franchise by extending the right to vote to 16 and 17 year olds. We will conduct an online survey before the referendum to identify the factors that will influence vote intention and likelihood of voting and two further surveys after the referendum to identify whether and why people voted the way they did. This will be a panel study, using the same respondents before and after so that we can determine how intentions translate into behaviour, and see how expectations influence reactions to the referendum result.

We will explore whether and how individuals decide to vote and how these processes might differ from those in elections at the Scottish or UK level. We will focus on the impact of the campaign itself and how campaign engagement might interact with the timing of vote decisions, knowledge of and perceived uncertainty about different constitutional options. Part of this involves describing fundamental facts about the nature of public opinion in Scotland. This includes a comprehensive assessment of preferences for different constitutional options in Scotland. The referendum offers a binary choice but polling has long demonstrated that the perceived 'middle ground' attracts most voters. We will explore the relationships among preferences for different constitutional options as well as knowledge of what distinguishes these options from each other. This will allow us to identify the structure, consistency and determinants of preferences about constitutional options in Scotland. Throughout we will locate Scottish findings within a comparative context, drawing on data and research from other constitutional referendums.

Our specific research questions stem from different theories of voting behaviour in elections and referendums. They focus on the impact of uncertainty, on the reaction of those who backed the losing side, on the extent to which constitutional change is about policy or identity, on variations in preferences across genders and the unique socialization into electoral participation that this offers to 16 and 17 year olds, many of whom will be unable to vote in the 2015 UK general election.

We are eager to contribute to public debate and facilitate engagement with the research process. To this end we will hold consultation events before the survey begins and will invite academic researchers and secondary students to suggest questions for the survey. 

With respect to the communication of findings, one benefit of online research is that it facilitates the quick release of data so that we will be able to contribute to public debate about the referendum result with analysis that identifies the types of voters who backed different options. We will conduct briefing events and produce briefing papers, as well as generate top quality academic research for academic journals and a co-authored book. In addition we will hold several capacity building events to facilitate access to data and data analysis for secondary school and university students.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Referendum and election surveys generate insights about public opinion. The impact of these insights - on government policy, on party and candidate strategies, on the media's understanding of voters' thinking - is by nature indirect and diffuse. However, the means of maximising such impact is the same. We have already discussed this proposal with a number of practitioners, policymakers and other impact partners: the campaigning teams; the Electoral Commission Scotland; researchers in the Scottish Government and other non-academic organisations such as the Electoral Reform Society; the mass media, notably the BBC and its Generation 2014 project; and teachers and students of Modern Studies and other subjects bridging the skills gap between social sciences and STEM. The extension of the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds provides both another set of impact partners and the opportunity to inform policy directly, as various stakeholders assess the impact of this innovation.

As described in detail in the Pathways to Impact document, we would engage these impact partners throughout the project, notably at three key stages:

1. Designing the surveys - In addition to inviting comments from our advisory board on drafts of the survey, we will also engage with impact partners in two ways: first, by an open consultation for all interested parties in which we will invite proposals for questions; second, by two parallel competitions - among researchers and among secondary school students - for small amounts of questionnaire space. In these ways, we will not only capitalise on existing links but forge new ones so as to form a wider network of interested parties.

2. Initial headline findings - The speed of internet surveys means that findings from our pre-referendum survey will be available the day after polling, and that post-referendum findings will follow just days later. These will be circulated to our impact partners and other interested parties via a range of channels: posts on policy blogs, press releases and media appearances, the project website, and social media. 

3. Further analysis - In parallel to our scientific outputs, we will produce non-technical briefings on some key issues: the extension of the franchise to those over 16; the efficacy of the referendum in informing the public; where constitutional preferences stand following the referendum; and the referendum's consequences beyond Scotland. These will serve as the basis for two workshops at which our impact partners can discuss the broader implications of our findings. 

Capitalising on the extension of the franchise to reach this difficult audience, we will seek a particular impact on first-time voters. We will develop materials based on the SRS, focused particularly but not only on the votes-at-16 issue, that are suitable for use not only in Modern Studies and Politics lessons but also in Maths and Statistics classes. In addition to circulating these materials to teachers, we will also host events of our own that demonstrate the role of our quantitative data in addressing important political questions. We will thereby contribute to wider efforts to boost statistical skills among young people in general, and social science students in particular.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>248349</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to civil servants in HMTreasury</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B41C9DC0-9A7E-4C9E-8FE5-B9DE4C8899F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation on Scottish attitudes to indyref and Brexit which sparked questions and discussion afterwards as well as follow-up requests for further meetings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c14075d4d634.69159381</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentations to Scottish Government, multiple, 2014-2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF59F0B4-7D97-4448-B9D4-AD7835A3E6A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have been invited six times to present research to civil servants working in the Scottish Government.

These have included academics, journalists, policy makers and politicians, secondary school students, teachers and the general public. This includes a mix of invitations to which we have responded, as well as engagements that we have initiated. The international reach includes presentations in Canada, the United States and Germany as well as in Wales, Scotland and England.

Findings have been used by journalists to report (in print, on radio and television) about public attitudes in Scotland and by policy makers (in both the Scottish Government and Scotland Office) to structure the terms of their own research projects.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>95900E7F-D356-4843-A40B-F21435510382</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e08d0134cd92.50707717</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The data from our survey have allowed us to establish why certain voters supported independence and why they voted to remain within the UK. We were able to identify the demographic predictors of support for independence as well as the role played by national identity and attitudes to leaders.

Older voters were more likely to support the union, as were those with higher incomes and higher levels of education. Among young voters, we find that it was not the very youngest in our dataset but those 25-34 who were most likely to support independence.

We have explored the impact of the campaign and specific campaign events. Some of this has focused on the impact of the Vow issued by the leaders of the three main UK parties in the week before the referendum. Our results show that the Vow was not a determining factor for voters. We have also been able to demonstrate that in general voters were happy with the democratic process surrounding the referendum. 

We have, however, detected unusual patterns in losers' consent, with some evidence that it is the referendum winners rather than the losers who are less satisfied with the way democracy works. We find too that those who perceived there to be a greater credibility gap between the arguments of their preferred side and the other side are happier with democracy. Here we expect that this might relate to the extent to which individuals were invested in the campaign as a deliberative process.

We have detected what might be considered surprising results. First, yes and no voters have different perceptions of what happened in the referendum. No voters were largely motivated by trying to get the best of both worlds by Yes voters are convinced that No voters were swayed by the Vow. Yes and No voters likewise have very different assessments of the extent to which the referendum has engineered a flourishing of democratic participation, with Yes voters believing that Scotland has changed and they as individuals will be more engaged. No voters are less convinced that this is the case.

Beyond the research findings, we were very successful in disseminating our findings through a variety of events and media. We have conducted over 30 presentations to public events and schools. Our presentations received considerable media attention. While many of our publications are still under submission we have a number that are in print already, including a co-authored monograph by Johns and Mitchell as well as a piece by Rob Johns on the Vow (see publications below).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are continuing to generate publications and have presented several conference papers. These will allow campaign teams to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different campaign strategies. In addition, information about the state of public attitudes in Scotland can help policy makers to identify constitutional changes that reflect popular opinion.

The 2014 referendum, 2015 UK General Election and 2016 Scottish Parliament election provide an opportunity to track how and why the partisan identification of voters is changing and to examine the effect of the referendum on the future civic engagement of Scots, including young Scots. We have applied for and received a grant to conduct the 2016 Scottish Election Study. The majority of the SES sample includes SRS respondents, so we are able to track their changing attitudes in real time. 

To reach a wider audience we have also conducted a MOOC (massive open online course) with colleagues in Cardiff to highlight the ways in which Scottish and Welsh voting behaviour varies. The MOOC interviews and live sessions drew heavily on SRS findings and how we must understand voter preferences in the referendum to understand voter choices in Scotland today.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1510760E-C442-4F9F-B7EB-E721C100FB27</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e08ec5751372.31045556</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.scottishreferendumstudy.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Scottish Attitudes post devolution: Lecture to Welsh Governance Centre visit to Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ACE8F926-D615-4E30-8DC3-A945AC2FE990</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Scottish Attitudes post devolution.
