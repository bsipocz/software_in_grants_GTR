For example, polymer aggregates are being developed as novel drug delivery platforms, designed to release a drug under certain predetermined physiological conditions, or the formation of insoluble protein and peptide assemblies is implicated in a number of diseases.Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is ubiquitous in its application across chemistry and has found great application in structural biology. Its success has been more limited in the investigation of aggregation phenomena, mainly being applied to the determination of thermodynamic parameters, with few examples of its use to study the kinetics of the aggregation process. The high degree of resonance overlap observed for molecular aggregates tends to preclude the use of high resolution methods, however, the determination of molecular sizes via the distribution of diffusion coefficients is still potentially tractable. For instance, polymer molecular weight distribution profiles have been determined using these NMR spectroscopic techniques.This proposal seeks to develop a time-resolved diffusion NMR methodology suitable for probing changes in aggregation state as a function of time. The proposal will focus on two complimentary aims. The first developing data analysis techniques suitable for the extraction of time-dependent distributions of diffusion coefficients during the aggregation process. This will allow information to be gained on the kinetics of the aggregation process in addition to the diffusion coefficient information. The second approach will extend the idea of chromatographic NMR to size-exclusion chromatography. The aim here is to improve the diffusion resolution by application of a in-situ chromatographic stationary phase to spread-out the distribution of diffusion coefficients. The combination of both methods should prove a powerful technique for probing aggregation phenomena in solution.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research described in this proposal will be of wide interest both within the NMR community and to a wider audience, interested in aggregation phenomena. While the nature of the research is in essence blue skies , a number of potential beneficiaries outside of the immediate academic magnetic resonance community are envisaged. The formation of molecular aggregates has implications in a variety of scientific and engineering fields, including nano-scale engineering in terms of (self) assembly, synthetic biology, peptide and protein assembly, aggregation and flocculation in water treatment and polymer science, and many others. The research described in this proposal will add to the analytical tools available for the investigation of aggregating systems, by providing information which is complementary to that obtained by other methods, for example laser light scattering. Potential beneficiaries include the polymer industry and water treatment companies. Links with industrial partners will be explored in conjunction with the university's Regional Research and Development office and through discussions with the departmental London Technology Network fellow. The major results will be published in leading high-impact journals, read by a variety of potential beneficiaries along with the more technical aspects being published in detail in more specialist journals. The methods developed and results obtained will be presented at national and international conferences both by the PI and other members of his research group. The wider audiences will be engaged through the schools outreach activities undertaken within the department, and as talks and demonstrations within the further outreach work of the department.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95403</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project sought to develop a method for investigating the early assembly of molecular aggregates through changes in the size of the aggregates monitored using diffusion NMR spectroscopy. The project was split into two components, the
first seeking to develop data analysis routines to extract the time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion coefficient from the NMR data and the second developing the idea of Chromatographic NMR to the use of size exclusion stationary phases.

Objective 1 extended the use of Tikhonov Regularization for stabilising the inversion of ill-posed problems to a modern computational framework and investigated different approaches to choosing an appropriate regularization parameter. In the latter part of the grant, techniques for denoising experimental data have been investigated for further improving the data analysis from the diffusion NMR data. Simple kinetic models of association have been used to model the time-dependent data and the inversion routines have been tests on these. The influence of experimental noise has been investigated and improvements to the solution of the time-dependent data are currently underway.

For objective 2 a number of experiments have been performed to investigate the use of a size exclusion chromatographic stationary phase. Initially, a number of experiments were performed with three stationary phases and a series of polymers of differing composition and molecular weight. A more quantitative approach was developed using a series of polymer molecular weight reference standards was undertaken. The use of the nano probe (a high-resolution magic angle spinning probe, obtained under this grant) has enabled an improvement in resolution due to the ability to remove sample inhomogeneity effects by spinning a 2kHz at the magic angle. During these experiments it was discovered that the operation of the diffusion ordered NMR experiments under magic angle spinning conditions was not as expected. The influence of the spinning on the data obtained in currently under intensive investigation to improve the quality of the data obtained.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The some of the data analysis techniques developed have already been implemented in the DOSYToolbox package from Nilsson (Manchester).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3949161B-3B38-46B7-9D1B-2D860D739E24</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5419916ee4c046.81408111</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>93C88C4B-61CA-46B4-83CE-AF5F5E05CC67</gtr:id><gtr:title>NMR characterization of the aggregation state of the azo dye sunset yellow in the isotropic phase.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The journal of physical chemistry.
