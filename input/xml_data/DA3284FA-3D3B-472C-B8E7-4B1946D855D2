The performative encounters produce an abundance of documentary material, and this growing collection of 'performance relics' now requires an organising structure. My aim is to develop a manageable archive and utilise these documents as a studio-based practice, and as the basis for making drawings. The drawings that come out of these encounters mimic strategies of documentation, where I copy or trace texts or images that emerge during the process of the participation. \n\nWhilst building on existing work, this Fellowship will represent a new departure by bringing into focus the antagonisms and creative forms of risk that takes place in collaborative work, and as such, there are ethical issues that arise that have to be addressed. These include providing an understanding amongst participants of the extent of their involvement, and their inclusion in the final outcome; identifying and clarifying where ownership and copyright resides; and sometimes, dealing with conflict during a participatory encounter. A significant part of my research will look at the debates and practices that have recently sprung up around the subject of art and social interaction. My aim will be to question the philanthropy that underlies this practice, often assuming that it is beneficial to the recipients, or that creative agency is a one-way channel that originates from the artist to the participants. However, what is often concealed by this kind of debate are the complex power relations and questions of ownership and authorship. \n\nTo delve deeper into these questions of the politics and poetics of social interaction as art, I shall take up an invitation by artist Jeanne van Heeswijk, to join the Blue House in IJburg; a recently developed residential area built on a cluster of man-made islands on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the heart of this growing residential area Heeswijk has initiated an experimental community of artists, architects, thinkers and scholars to actively help shape the cultural dialogue between inhabitants of Block 35 and the emerging community.\n\nThe Centre for Drawing at Wimbledon College of Art will provide an excellent host for my Fellowship and it will enable me to explore the relationship between collaboration and drawing. Through an engagement and discussions with colleagues, it will be my first opportunity to consider this practice within an academic framework, and to ask what status drawing might occupy within this 'relational' context. The Project Space at the Centre for Drawing is an appropriate setting for the collaborative encounters and a suitable context for developing my ideas on copying and tracing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>263327</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Sing for your Supper was a performative event that involved bringing together a number of artists and migrants 'without papers' to discuss Europe and the experience of migrants.

The programme - &amp;iexcl;Afuera! Art in Public Spaces, was a large-scale project inviting international artists to respond to the city. On the 4 October 2010, a choral group from the Architectural School, directed by Gustavo Maldino sang Maria Elena Walsh's song 'Oraci&amp;oacute;n a la Justicia' (A Prayer to Justice), in the former Police Detention Centre in the heart of the city, what is now the Memorial Museum, attesting to the violation of human rights that took place during the &amp;quot;Dirty War 1978-1983&amp;quot;. A few days before, the Afuera curatorial team arranged with the local radio station for a call to go out to invite the general public to join the performance in the Museum. About 60 people joined the performance.

The structure of this artist book both reflects the fragmentary nature of Barthes's narrative, as well as the multiple perspectives of Boyce's collaborators, who worked with her to explore ideas around 'care', an emotion embodied in a steady, deep and enduring commitment to people and things; an emotion that is 'like love'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>732313DA-4CA7-48B2-A5CC-F968AB8C900C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sonia Boyce

It is a collaboration with sound artist Ain Bailey, also known as DJ Miss Bailey - one of the named in the Devotional series, with Sonia Boyce. As a way to re-activate the archive Ain was invited to delve into the Devotional Collection to create a new sound work, while Sonia Boyce turned to the digital archive of the internet. They decided to settle on looking at the performer Adelaide Hall, a 1920s Jazz singer from New York, who came to Britain in the 1930s and decided to settle and make London her home, until she died in the 1990s.
Adelaide Hall is noted as one of the pioneers of Jazz Scat, an improvisational form of wordless, often nonsensical, singing that plays with syllables. In 'Oh Adelaide', we hear the song 'Creole Love Call', a duet made with Duke Ellington, an excerpt of which features in the immersive soundtrack of the film, that compresses several musical tracks from the Devotional Collection. The treatment of the video footage, sees sheer brightness used which almost threatens to engulf everything in its path.</gtr:description><gtr:id>530D402A-B966-42A8-9E5C-2D5BB9B2CA6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Oh Adelaide' has been shown in the following exhibitions:

The Devotional Series began in 1999, with a group of women from Liverpool, brought together with the artist through the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT). Asked to sing and recall the first record they ever bought, the women in the group began to build a collective map of black British performers they could remember. The first name to be nominated was Shirley Bassey and from that the Devotional Series was born.
Since then, word of mouth has spread as members of the general public have added their favourites, and even personal items that have gone into the Devotional Collection. Today the list contains over two hundred names. Each celebrating an icon; each icon triggers a song; and each song a moment that is as significant to a personal memory as it is to a generation's collective memory. Ranging from the infamous to the unsung, from the early part of the twentieth century to the present, the Devotional Series is a group portrait that upholds the existence, the pleasures and the persistence of women who choose to make music.
As a body of work, the Devotional Series has had a mutable existence, continually re-designing itself to embody aspects of its host.
As the culmination of a decade of gathering, Boyce tailored the Devotional Wallpaper (2008) as a unique appraisal of the series. The display takes the form of two hundred names elaborately hand-drawn as repetitive concentric lines made into a wallpaper print measuring two metres high by five metres wide: a veritable roll call of legendary names. As such, over time some names come out of the design to allow others to enter, so that it is a continuously changing print.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD6DEF32-FE7E-4A75-86D3-9D223CE8690B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 'Devtional Wallpaper' has been shown in the following exhibitions:

While classic jazz songs such as &amp;quot;Signifying Monkey&amp;quot; by Oscar Brown Junior, hip-hop tracks such as Utfo's &amp;quot;Ask Yo Mama&amp;quot;, the American trash-talking game &amp;quot;dirty dozen&amp;quot; or the numerous Yo Mama jokes use the &amp;quot;mother&amp;quot; figure just as an instrument of an artistic verbal fight to insult and psychologically undermine the opponent, the exhibition project Ask Yo Mama turns the insolent pattern of rap and scat inside out: it takes the words literally and consciously focuses on female artists, who present their version of the story in the form of an artistic work that relates to &amp;quot;black sound&amp;quot;.
The group exhibition which took place at the Kunstraum Niederoesterreich in Vienna, included the artworks of Ihu Anyanwu, Anna Zwingl, Ina Wudtke, Sangam Sharma, Constanze Schweiger, Yvette Mattern and Sonia Boyce.</gtr:description><gtr:id>43A06465-DBF6-45E5-93EF-07ADB1865D12</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This exhibition showed the 'Devotional Wallpaper'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-8395503692.697271a7102cde</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>&quot;Ask Yo Mama&quot;.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.kunstraum.net/en/programme/42-ask-yo-mama</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The main focus of this exhibition was wallpapers designed by artists.

&amp;quot;My current concerns are to find ways to activate pre-existing documents and objects to create new meanings - in short, to create collages. As such, it was rather impish of me to choose a hand-knitted egg cosy from the Marx-Lambert Collection. Once chosen, it seemed logical to fulfil its function to cover something else. Reverence aside, by juxtaposing the egg cosy with the alabaster relief 'The Resurrection', the combined object vacillates between comfort and its underside - aggression.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>27F13B32-1853-43EE-A695-51F58623645D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Compton Verney's British Folk Art collection appears in unexpected places around the collections and throughout the building.

It is a collaboration with sound artist Ain Bailey, also known as DJ Miss Bailey - one of the named in the Devotional series, with Sonia Boyce. As a way to re-activate the archive Ain was invited to delve into the Devotional Collection to create a new sound work, while Sonia Boyce turned to the digital archive of the internet. They decided to settle on looking at the performer Adelaide Hall, a 1920s Jazz singer from New York, who came to Britain in the 1930s and decided to settle and make London her home, until she died in the 1990s.
Adelaide Hall is noted as one of the pioneers of Jazz Scat, an improvisational form of wordless, often nonsensical, singing that plays with syllables. In 'Oh Adelaide', we hear the song 'Creole Love Call', a duet made with Duke Ellington, an excerpt of which features in the immersive soundtrack of the film, that compresses several musical tracks from the Devotional Collection. The treatment of the video footage, sees sheer brightness used which almost threatens to engulf everything in its path.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC316934-149E-448E-8B65-31D5A23C9178</gtr:id><gtr:impact>S/N: Signal to Noise, Whitney Museum of Modern Art/The Kitchen, New York exhibition (22 May - 13 June 2015).

The exhibition explores universal ideas around the concept of care - the emotion we invest in others and in the making of works of art.
In Bristol, Boyce produced a series of artworks from classroom discussions, which address fragmentary experience of longing, and raise questions about due care and contemporary life. Unique to Liverpool, Like Love - Part Two includes new work by Boyce in collaboration with the Blue Room, a year round arts service for adults with learning disabilities that operates three days a week at the Bluecoat. The encounters the adults experienced around the question of care and desire has informed and drive the creative process. Boyce met regularly with the Blue Room group over a past six month period; engaging with the participants to create drawings and films around their experiences with love. In one encounter, Sonia and the Blue Room took to Crosby beach to make a film of the participants dancing to their favourite love songs. The artworks in the exhibition consisted of three filmed interviews with participants asking each to talk about love and care. Adjacent to these films hung three large-scale prints based on drawings made between the artists and the participants. On the other side of the gallery a single-channel video of the group dancing on Crosby Beach was screened.</gtr:description><gtr:id>50B30B96-9433-4B7F-B525-25D0C52265A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The whole process of creating this work - alongside the other two parts of the trilogy - involved a durational period of engagement with participants to co-produce the final artworks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-1929210137.5099366a70d5464</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>&quot;Like Love Part Two&quot;, a series of 4 films and 3 prints based on collaborative drawings, Bluecoat Gallery, Liverpool.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.artinliverpool.com/?p=16443</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Femmes 'R' Us: Feminism in pop music, art and film today&amp;quot; was a group exhibition at Radialsystem V in Berlin.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BEBCA861-4B66-43C6-ACE4-EB4766D6A16F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Femmes 'R' Us&amp;quot; was the first time the Devotional Wallpaper was exhibited, which at that point was a silk-screen print.
