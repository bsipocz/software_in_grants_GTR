This will have applications in geometry and theoretical physics.Manifolds are the basic objects of modern geometry. The line, the plane, and three-dimensional space are all manifolds, and so are less rigid objects like the surface of a torus (doughnut); even some objects which cannot be `visualised', like the four-dimensional spacetimes of general relativity, are manifolds.As well as being studied in their own right by geometers, manifolds arise in other areas of mathematics, most importantly in theoretical physics and algebraic geometry.A classification of a family of manifolds is a description of the family, together with a method for determining where in the family any given manifold lies. Classifications have immediate applications to any of the areas in which manifolds arise. For example, if the solution to a physical problem is known to be a special manifold, then a classification of those manifolds will act as a list of the solutions to the original physical problem.The collection of manifolds that I will classify are the `compact, simply-connected, spin, 7-manifolds'. `Compact, simply-connected' means that the manifolds' overall shape is not too complicated, and that I can use some well-established classification methods. `Spin' means that the manifolds have a special structure which gives me powerful ways of measuring their shape. I will explain how the classification will have applications in geometry and in a current topic called `elliptic cohomology', and also how it is, in a sense, the next incomplete classification.First, my classification will include many manifolds which geometers have recently constructed to show that special features, studied in theory, do exist in fact. The examples in question were the first of their kind, and it is still not known how many more there are. My classification will immediately show just how varied the current examples really are, and could be used to show how many exist in total.Second, elliptic cohomology is the source of much current interest. It is a way of measuring spaces, and is most effective on `string' manifolds. These are like spin-manifolds but with much more structure. Elliptic cohomology is relevant because the most important manifolds in my classification will be string, and I hope to be able to understand them using only elliptic cohomology. This would be a great result, for the following reason: Theoretical physicists have a very intuitive way of understanding elliptic cohomology, and that would give me an entirely new way to understand and use my classification.Finally, my proposed classification is `the next in line'. Classifications in the `low' dimensions (one to four) are incomplete and are resistant to general methods, but in `high' dimensions (five onwards) a technique called `surgery theory' becomes available. Surgery is easiest when manifolds are compact and simply connected (assumptions I will make), and has been used to classify all of the compact simply-connected manifolds in dimension five and many of those in dimension six; progress is slow from here because surgery needs input which is harder to provide as the dimension increases. However, Kreck has recently modified surgery theory, and it now requires much less input. Kreck's surgery has successfully classified some manifolds in dimension seven. It is therefore natural to exploit this development to understand all compact, simply-connected manifolds in dimension seven, and to begin this with the spin manifolds.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183107</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>645D303B-B3F3-442D-86CF-AD81EFAD6FFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The age grading and the Chen-Ruan cup product</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ef6cab6d43f67709f306006356614d25"><gtr:id>ef6cab6d43f67709f306006356614d25</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hepworth R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d06c06c4d2b80a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EA0AC9FB-5B48-476D-9F56-943A3C53885B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Morse inequalities for orbifold cohomology</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Algebraic &amp; Geometric Topology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ef6cab6d43f67709f306006356614d25"><gtr:id>ef6cab6d43f67709f306006356614d25</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hepworth R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d08408490c47f8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/D066980/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9C124926-5968-486F-9B51-CCEB6C4E9650</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
