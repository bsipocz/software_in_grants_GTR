Mathematics lies at its root, and it would be hard to find a better one on which to demonstrate the working of the mathematical intellect . Geometric Representation Theory is a research area that studies various geometric objects in order to obtain useful information about symmetries as it appears in mathematics, namely in the form of representations of groups. Representations have a large impact on mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and their study via geometric methods is a very active area of modern research. Combining one area of mathematics, namely geometry, with another, namely representation theory, means that this research builds on the expertise of two strong areas of British research in an inter-disciplinary way.As is common with post doctoral projects, this is an opportunity to develop the personal career of the candidate, as well as the research of the collaborators at the Host Institution. In addition to this, the project is also expected to stimulate both research in geometry, as well as representation theory, and therefore to have a particularly broad appeal to the UK research community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100352</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The results and techniques in the paper &amp;quot;The smooth representations of GL_2(o)&amp;quot; have been applied in current work of the PI and J.

The paper &amp;quot;On Cuspidal Representations of General Linear Groups over Discrete Valuation Rings&amp;quot; played a major role for the PhD dissertation and following papers by P. Singla.

More recently zeta functions have started to play a role also in group theory and representation theory. In these cases the zeta function encodes an infinite sequence of numbers a_1, a_2,..., where a_n is, for instance, the number of irreducible n-dimensional representations of a group. The zeta function defined using this sequence is called the representation zeta function of the group. Among other things, the zeta functions help us to say something about the growth rate of the sequence a_1, a_2,.... For large classes of interesting groups the precise rate of growth is governed by a rational number called the abscissa of convergence of the zeta function. 

In this project I am working together with my PDRA Jokke H&amp;auml;s&amp;auml;. So far we have obtained the following results:

1. A refinement of a result of Liebeck and Shalev which says that the abscissa of convergence of a family of finite simple groups of Lie type is r/k where r is the rank and k is the number of positive roots. We have proved that the representations contributing to the abscissa are precisely the so-called regular representations. 

2. A new and simplified proof that the abscissa of convergence of a simple compact Lie group is r/k, where r is the rank and k is the number of positive roots. This was previously established by Larsen and Lubotzky, using a different argument. As a consequence, we prove that also in this case the representations contributing to the abscissa are precisely the regular ones (i.e, corresponding to a regular weight).

3. We have proved that the group GL_N(o), where o is a compact discrete valuation ring, has finitely many twist-isoclasses of representations of each dimension. Moreover, we have proved that if the characteristic of o does not divide N, then the twist representation zeta function of GL_N(o) has the same abscissa of convergence as the representation zeta function of SL_N(o).

4. We have almost finished computing the abscissae of the twist representation zeta functions of GL_2(o), for arbitrary o. In particular, when o has characteristic 0 but residue characteristic 2, this leads to the value of the abscissa for SL_2(o), which was previously unknown.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results of finite groups of Lie type and Lie groups is currently the best explanation of why the abscissae are exactly r/k, but further work of experts in the field may eventually result in a full explanation.
Our results for GL_2(o) or SL_2(o) will be the first ones on the abscissae of convergence in the case where o has residue characteristic 2. Previous techniques were inadequate to deal with these case. This opens up a host of new questions about representation zeta functions of SL_N(o) in &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; characteristic, that is, when the residue characteristic of o divides N, or when the characteristic of o itself divides N. These results are of interest in connection with the search for a generalisation of a result of Jaikin-Zapirain beyond compact p-adic analytic groups. The results are also closely connected with the work of Avni, Klopsch, Onn and Voll, and it is likely that our results will be of interest to these workers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B9B7910A-73B9-4C7D-BAF3-6088C5DFF9FD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5450b92d433c87.03939927</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E9A4F10D-F320-4E70-8784-F306F6173A60</gtr:id><gtr:title>On cuspidal representations of general linear groups over discrete valuation rings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Israel Journal of Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b78bcd72f84ec9382717a68a72adea53"><gtr:id>b78bcd72f84ec9382717a68a72adea53</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aubert A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdffdfed723a7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>98DAA374-6F3D-48CF-AA93-D2BE031123D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Smooth Representations of GL
