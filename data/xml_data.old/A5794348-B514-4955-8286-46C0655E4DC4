Protein drugs have the advantage that they are highly specific for a particular target: antibodies are a good example. They can be developed to bind with high affinity to block a specific receptor on the surface of a cell, inhibiting the progress of disease. The use of this new kind of drug in the clinic has grown rapidly over the last two decades, because protein drugs offer the potential for therapeutic intervention which would be difficult or impossible to replicate with small molecule medicines. 
Although these protein drugs are generally well-tolerated and have opened up exciting new avenues for the treatment of disease, this approach has come with a specific problem. Biotherapeutic proteins (even proteins which are designed to 'look' human) can be recognised as being foreign by the immune system of the patient. This can lead to production of antibodies within the patient which bind to the protein drug and prevent it from functioning effectively. In some cases, the consequences have been more severe, leading to serious adverse health effects in patients undergoing treatment. The origin of this problem lies in the way in which the immune system recognises 'foreign' molecules: a classic question in immunology is, 'why does the immune system not attack its own host's cells?' We now know that there are sophisticated systems for eliminating or inactivating immune cells which would recognise 'self' antigens, to prevent this from happening. This phenomenon is called 'tolerance'. Many protein drugs, although apparently identical to those produced by the host, nevertheless manage somehow to breakdown tolerance and provoke an immune response. It is still unclear exactly how this happens. The aim of this proposal is to investigate this phenomenon and, ultimately, to use the information obtained to inform the design and development of more effective protein drugs in the future. 

We will focus on one particular aspect which impacts on the immune response to protein drugs- a behaviour known as aggregation. Anyone who has ever boiled an egg is familiar with this behaviour: the white of the egg, after boiling, is solidified. Heat treatment pulls the structure of the protein (albumin) in the egg white apart and the individual protein chains adhere into a dense mesh. This type of behaviour is a general property of proteins, and a version of it can occur in preparations of protein drugs. The presence of aggregates in the preparation is important, as we know that they are very effective at influencing the complex cellular and molecular processes that lead to an immune response. Our proposal will investigate the different immunological responses induced by aggregates from a selection of drug-like proteins. In particular, we seek to determine how these different responses are influenced and modulated by aggregate size, which is the main criterion used to characterise them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The overall aim of the proposal is to study the quality and vigour of the immune response to selected model biotherapeutic proteins, and the aggregates generated from them. Our experimental approach will combine studies using a well characterised (BALB/c strain) mouse model of protein immunogenicity and allergenicity, cultured human and mouse dendritic cells (DCs) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The programme will comprise the following tasks:

Task 1: Production and characterisation of recombinant mouse and human protein aggregates for use in immunological investigations.

Task 2: To determine whether aggregation influences the stimulation of adaptive immune responses in vivo. A mouse (BALB/c) model will be used to monitor whether aggregation of recombinant mouse proteins impacts on: 
a) IgG isotype distribution 
b) IgE antibody production 
c) cytokine production (Interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17 and IL-22)
d) the balance between antigen-driven CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte responses 
e) the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs)
f) the number and phenotype of CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC) in the spleen.

Task 3: To determine whether aggregation influences the stimulation of primary immune responses in vitro. To address this question, the elicitation of human T and B cell responses in vitro by aggregated and non-aggregated human/humanised proteins will be characterised.

Task 4: Characterisation of the mechanistic basis for differential effects of aggregated and non-aggregated proteins to cause immune stimulation. The investigation will determine whether aggregated and non-aggregated proteins display a differential potential to 
a) provoke cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMC).
b) drive the activation of mouse and human DC in vitro.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have beneficiaries from four distinct groupings:

1. Pharmaceutical companies developing biotherapeutic medicines and vaccines.
The relevance of the proposed research to the biopharmaceutical sector is obvious and requires little elaboration, given that Lonza are joint applicants and contributing half of the cost of this programme. Specifically, the research will enable the design of more effective therapeutics through the identification and control of features leading to immune responses; this can be applied to both biotherapeutics, where the goal is to minimise immune responses, and vaccines, where stimulation of an effective immune response is important. Results will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations and also the informal contacts which the academic applicants (JPD/IK/RJD) have with industry (subject to agreement with the industrial partner, Lonza). Lonza will also use the results to improve its service offering for the design of therapeutics. Pharmaceutical companies will be able to innovate new biotherapeutics with greater confidence if they can identify and control features (such as aggregation size populations) which are less likely to provoke immune responses.

2. Training of staff employed on the grant
The UK hosts a large and expanding bioprocessing community: there are around 15 members of the BBSRC, EPSRC and Industry-funded Bioprocessing Research Industry Club. Promoting the development of training in skills areas relating to bioprocessing products is a priority, and this proposal will contribute to that overall goal. In particular, the combination of protein biochemistry, immunology and animal experimentation will help to develop skills in the employed research staff which will promote their employability and benefit the sector as a whole. Furthermore, as is often the case, funding of a research proposal generates a 'core' of scientific expertise which acts as a nucleus for further industrial collaborations and teaching/training of Masters and PhD students.

3. Regulatory authorities 
Scientists working for regulatory authorities constitute the third group of more general beneficiaries for this proposal. Examples include the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA), and, in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC; until recently part of the Health Protection Agency). Clearly, the problem of unwanted immunogenicity in biotherapeutics has a direct bearing on the regulation of new medicines. A substantial body of scientists work within these and similar regulatory authorities on medicine safety: research which helps to improve guidelines and the monitoring of new drugs will obviously be of value to them. Representatives from regulatory bodies are regular attendees at national and international conferences, and so will be informed of our results through that route, as well as having access through our publications and personal contacts.

4. Patients who will be treated with biotherapeutic medicines
Ultimately, the most important grouping to benefit from this proposal will be future patients. The global market for biological medicines in 2011 was $94bn (Thompson Reuters) and is continuing to grow. The numbers of people who will be treated with such drugs in the next 10 years is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands. Reduction or removal of those types of aggregates which would otherwise potentiate the immunogenicity of a drug will have obvious health benefits. An improved understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying the response to biotherapeutics is therefore going to be an important part of the necessary scientific background which is taken into account when decisions are made about aggregate content in a biological medicine.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>461399</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BRIC dissemination event &amp; BioProNet, Manchester 21-22 October</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDAFD2A2-3C85-4B0B-825B-7D19DDAD69D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster display, as a focus for general discussion and dissemination of our work to industry and academia.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a2c61dc007.37524704</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Year 10 pupils work experience</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26707C00-F1F8-4A3A-82FD-A1569B80A0A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Carried out a laboratory demonstration on protein expression.

Examples include the successful drug Adalimumab (also known by its trade name Humira), which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Protein drugs have the advantage that they are highly specific for a particular target: they can bind with high affinity to block a specific protein, inhibiting the progress of disease. The use of this new kind of drug in the clinic has grown rapidly over the last two decades, because protein drugs offer the potential for therapeutic intervention which would be difficult or impossible to replicate with small molecule medicines. This revolution has been made possible through the development of monoclonal antibodies- a culture derived from a single hybridoma cell will produce only one specific antibody, which will recognize only one particular 'target', or antigen. Because they are derived from a single clone, they are termed monoclonal antibodies. They allow us to produce, in principle, unlimited quantities of a specific antibody in a lab or production facility. Monoclonal antibodies have found many applications in scientific research, as well as their use in medicine.
Although therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are generally well-tolerated and have opened up exciting new avenues for the treatment of disease, this approach has come with a specific problem. Biotherapeutic proteins (even proteins which are designed to 'look' human) can be recognised as being foreign by the immune system of the patient. This can lead to production of antibodies within the patient which bind to the protein drug and prevent it from functioning effectively (so-called 'anti-drug antibodies', or 'ADAs'). In some cases, the consequences can be more severe, leading to serious adverse health effects in patients undergoing treatment. More often, however, the formation of ADAs impairs the efficacy of drug therapy. The degree to which individual patients form ADAs varies considerably from person to person, although it is not routinely monitored. Therapeutic antibodies are very expensive, so prolonging treatment when it is ineffective is wasteful and expensive. 
A key factor in promoting ADA formation is aggregation- the formation of large, amorphous particles by antibodies in solution. We have found that we can extract more detailed information on the ADA response to aggregates by using an approach called 'immunoprofiling'. This allows us to obtain a profile of the ADAs formed. To date, we have only shown this effect with 'model' proteins- made in the lab. We now wish to extend the work to verify that the method can also be applied to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The results will open up new ways in which to assay ADA formation and may ultimately help to promote more economical use of therapeutic antibodies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have implications for the way in which anti-drugs antibodies are analysed.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>78FB721C-A818-4A88-90DD-A1C4A6487C89</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a15702ad2e6.67820102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>B-cell epitope profiling differentiates immunogenic responses to protein aggregates
Aggregation of monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic proteins has been well documented as a key factor in the generation of undesirable immunogenicity which can lead to the shortening of serum half-life, neutralisation of function and adverse clinical consequences. Aggregation may enhance immunogenic potential through increased antigen presentation, repetitive antigen patterning and generation of non-native epitopes. Using peptide microarray technology, we have designed a model system that examines the changes in the B-cell epitope repertoire between native and aggregated proteins.
Two recombinant human antibody fragments were selected as model proteins; VH (heavy V domain) and scFv (single chain of heavy and light V domains). VH and scFv proteins were aggregated by heating to 60&amp;deg;C and 40&amp;deg;C respectively. Aggregation was confirmed by dynamic light scattering. BALB/c strain mice were immunised with either protein (monomer or aggregate). Anti-VH or anti-scFv serum IgG titres were analysed by ELISA. B-cell epitopes were screened by peptide array consisting of overlapping peptide libraries for both VH and scFV proteins. Serum samples were analysed on the arrays and total IgG and IgG isotype measured by fluorescence detection.
Both proteins form irreversible aggregates with particle size in the range of 1-3&amp;micro;m. Immunisation with aggregate protein demonstrated an increase in IgG titre compared to monomer and a significant switch to IgG2a isotype for both proteins, indicative of a T helper type 1 response. 
Analysis of sera by epitope array showed differential IgG and isotype signatures between aggregate and monomer immunised serum. Recognition of a small number of epitope peptides was significantly increased in aggregate immunised serum compared to monomer.
It is proposed that protein aggregation changes the B cell epitope landscape and array technology can aid identification of enhanced immunogenic sequences. Knowledge of aggregate related epitopes will aid development of therapeutic proteins and the analysis of anti-drug antibodies in patients.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DE7A831-6CDA-4FBA-AEA0-4C3644E73AD9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of this method is in progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c16b52a57560.24964585</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Use of synthetic peptide arrays to differentiate antibody responses to aggregates of therapeutic proteins</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>04B52058-171F-4268-8637-00FD17D98F0C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proofreading of substrate structure by the Twin-Arginine Translocase is highly dependent on substrate conformational flexibility but surprisingly tolerant of surface charge and hydrophobicity changes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochimica et biophysica acta</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6ecf9bcd20a473f6171c7ca5bf76c126"><gtr:id>6ecf9bcd20a473f6171c7ca5bf76c126</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones AS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-3002</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58be955cb1fee5.33018399</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DD55F3E1-8D9B-4FB4-87B1-3DD78B382880</gtr:id><gtr:title>Influence of Escherichia coli chaperone DnaK on protein immunogenicity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35ebda9cc367bfc1bc5c82bddd81683e"><gtr:id>35ebda9cc367bfc1bc5c82bddd81683e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ratanji KD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0019-2805</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58be98b7431a04.18204793</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L006391/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8A1414BC-05E5-4D38-BDC1-A953EE4AF4E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Protein chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
