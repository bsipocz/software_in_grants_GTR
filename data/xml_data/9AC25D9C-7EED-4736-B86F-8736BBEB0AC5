It will do this by analysing the wartime role of Sir John Anderson (1882-1958), now a largely forgotten individual but a dominant figure during the war who held a position of unique influence in Whitehall. He was described as 'the most powerful man in the realm', and Churchill considered Anderson his successor should he die before the end of the conflict.

MP for the Scottish Universities (1938-50), Anderson was a civil servant by background, and had dealt with multiple challenges to the state as Under-Secretary for Ireland, Governor of Bengal, and Home Secretary. But Anderson came into his own following the formation of the Churchill Coalition in 1940, and Churchill relied on him as the 'home front Prime Minister'. No other politician matched his mastery of Whitehall.

The Lord President's Committee was formed in late 1940 to act as a coordinating body on the domestic front. It was the centre of power in wartime Whitehall and, as Lord President until 1943, Anderson exercised considerable influence over its work. In doing so he was forced to contend with civil service intransigence and attempts by Labour party ministers to drive the British state towards socialism. In responding to this, Anderson implemented a distinctively Conservative statecraft that has been lost amid triumphalist social-democratic narratives of the war but which actually contributed much towards the metamorphosis of the state. Yet, despite the significance of the Lord President's Committee, this 'domestic War Cabinet' has never been studied.

This project will be built around Anderson as an exemplar of Conservative statecraft. Historians of conservative ideas often point to a belief in decisive action married to strategies of obstruction as animating conservatism; but the paradoxical combination of decisive action as a doctrine and deliberate obstruction as a strategy are rarely made central by historians of Conservative politics (with the exception of recent work on Lord Salisbury). One major aim is to improve understanding of how these concepts were applied to governing by twentieth-century Conservatives. Churchill, preoccupied by war, failed to provide effective Conservative leadership; that task was taken up by Anderson.

 The politics of financial policy-making during the war, likewise, have not been analysed. Yet the state's means of, and attitudes towards, raising money from its citizens were fundamentally reshaped; new doctrines like Keynesianism warred with orthodox finance; and some of the major figures of modern Britain - Churchill, Bevin, Attlee, Keynes - struggled to influence policy. Appointed Chancellor in October 1943, Anderson was tasked by Churchill with ensuring that financial prudence would be the lodestar of government while simultaneously meeting expectations of reform. Occupying a leading department of state, Anderson fought to obstruct Labour while taking the British state in new directions.

My previous book Attlee's War (2011) highlighted the scope for a transformative research agenda on wartime Britain. This project will carry this to fruition through a ground-breaking contribution to our understanding of government, policy, and Conservative politics in the war. In the cockpit of state for five years, Anderson did more than any individual to oversee the evolution of the British state; while others dreamed of rewriting the social contract, Anderson took the lead in turning that into practice. The project will shed light on this process. In doing so it will enhance awareness of the birth of the contemporary state. One aim of the eventual book flowing from the project will be to contextualise the links between the 1940s and the present by exploring the origins of contemporary perceptions of the duties of the state.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will target a broad audience of engaged members of the general public and public policy professionals. It will do so through a variety of innovative methods and media. In examining issues relevant to contemporary political debates - the size and duties of the state, Conservative statecraft, and coalition politics - the potential for impact is obvious.

One important target group will be those working around public policy. This encompasses people in government, political parties (especially the Conservative party), think-tanks, and the media. By disseminating my findings - and the lessons for some of today's challenges that can derived from them - through the print and online media, the proposed research will have demonstrable impact by contributing to, and helping to shape, the most important public debate of twenty-first century Britain. I will seek to contribute to the work of Select Committee inquiries (as I have with my recent work on contemporary security policy), to the periodical press, and online politics/public policy websites. 

Likewise, the project will be pitched at the informed public more broadly. In addition to reaching them through the means identified above, I intend to give a series of public lectures (in Edinburgh and London) on British government during the Second World War; to launch a blog to share research findings; and to explore in partnership with the National Archives website the possibility of improving their content and information about the War Cabinet papers. The history of the Second World War is always a subject of popular interest. By seeking to fill striking gaps in our knowledge of how British government operated during the war, the project will make an important contribution to awareness of a culturally-resonant topic.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Consultancy work on a forthcoming major film on wartime politics in Britain</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0551C55-D5A7-4CFC-9347-4653A2E9DD37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was approached by Anthony McCarten (screenwriter of the Bafta and Golden Globes-award winning film, and Academy Award-nominee, The Theory of Everything, about Professor Stephen Hawking) to provide historical advice on his next screenplay, a major feature film called Darkest Hour, exploring British political leadership and Cabinet politics during the war. The film will centre on Winston Churchill and his relationship with the Cabinet, as well as the political conflicts and manoeuvres of the period. McCarten wants to construct a fresh public portrayal of this iconic period and in a number of detailed emails asked me for advice on the interpretation of key sources, such as the War Cabinet papers. I advised him on the personalities and policies involved, as well as how this connected to material in other sources.

I was invited by a public affairs executive at the Local Government Association to prepare a briefing paper that would inform their political planning ahead of the highly uncertain 2015 general election. Headquartered in Westminster, the LGA is the national voice of local government in Britain. I was asked to author a paper analysing what happened the last time a coalition government broke up and went into a general election - which was at the end of the Second World War, in 1945. I was also asked to draw some potential lessons, and highlight important differences, between 1945 and 2015 in terms of coalition break up. The eventual briefing paper ran to 2,200 words and was well-received by the executive. He communicated that the paper had been discussed at a strategy meeting and stimulated discussion.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b9b4615e83f2.64407172</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Magazine article drawing analogies between Conservative party strategy for 1945 and 2015 elections</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A4D5947-7099-48DF-982B-1F31A37158BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This piece will be published in The Salisbury Review, the only UK magazine of Conservative thought, in 2015.

Judging from the reaction of the audience and their challenging questions, the event sparked the interest of the students. The head of History at the school subsequently communicated that the event had been a major success and the boys were still discussing it several days later.

There have been a number of key findings.

First has been the rediscovery, and excavation, of the Conservative contribution to domestic government and politics during the Second World War. This has been largely neglected in a welfarist and social-democratic historiography built up over several generations. This has centred on three major policy areas: the reorganisation of Whitehall in order to maximise national production; finance; and post-war planning at home and abroad. It feeds into a series of articles, public engagement/consultancy activities, and a large book on wartime British politics and leadership (160,000 words) targeted at a broad, non-academic audience.

The role of John Anderson was crucial to all three. My research has documented for the first time just how 'the most powerful man in the realm' actually operated and the way in which he was able to bend wartime Whitehall to his will. It has also highlighted his key role in post-war planning. The project involved revisiting large archives and asking fresh questions of them (in the case of the Lord President's Committee, this was one of the great unexplored archival hinterlands of modern political history) and, in light of what I discovered, I was able to generate important findings that evolved the project in organic ways. For instance I discovered that in finance, the contribution of Anderson was less significant than I had anticipated and less important than his Conservative predecessor at the Treasury, Sir Kingsley Wood - and my research outputs reflected that. I was also able to reconstruct the Conservative outlook on the post-war world - encompassing trade and geopolitics as well as the more familiar arguments about welfare - and have used that to generate an important challenge to conventional narratives of the 1945 election.

These findings have so far been communicated to specialists in journal form, as well as to broader audiences through engagement. The next major stage is completion of the book, The End is Nigh: British Politics, Power and the Second World War.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Key next steps include:

* Completion of The End is Nigh: British Politics, Power and the Second World War, a 160,000-word book that offers a panoramic and revisionist perspective on the period and is aimed at a broad audience outside academia.

* This will offer significant opportunities for significant public engagement work, both spoken and written, through promotional activities for the book. Both the book and the promotion will be key to communicating the findings to a non-academic audience.

* Publication of another journal article, which has been drafted out and is under consideration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E66B54DC-0FCA-4AD5-B17C-188A8AC5CCF9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b9bf3e126752.32296971</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>078F31E4-F554-4EBF-A25C-760C481C3ACF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Financial policy, coalition and Sir Kingsley Wood, 1940-1</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Twentieth Century British History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a80d20e0c90228a118a85f79325dfc1e"><gtr:id>a80d20e0c90228a118a85f79325dfc1e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crowcroft R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f10a49704</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EB0AAC8C-77F2-4758-A52A-27DFB702D620</gtr:id><gtr:title>Peering into the future: British Conservative leaders and the problem of national renewal, 1942-5</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Historical Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a80d20e0c90228a118a85f79325dfc1e"><gtr:id>a80d20e0c90228a118a85f79325dfc1e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crowcroft R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7321e3a00499.94959270</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>20F3E761-F9A2-4C47-84C2-4976F8FA6C14</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;acirc;??Making a Reality of Collective Responsibility&amp;acirc;??: The Lord President's Committee, Coalition and the British State at War, 1941&amp;acirc;??42</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Contemporary British History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a80d20e0c90228a118a85f79325dfc1e"><gtr:id>a80d20e0c90228a118a85f79325dfc1e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crowcroft R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f10b02a61</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K003062/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
