These different forms are termed enantiomers and much effort in modern synthetic organic chemistry as been devoted to developing efficient routes that facilitate the selective preparation of one enantiomer over another. One of the more established ways to address this problem is to attach a chiral auxiliary to the substrate of choice, the function of which is to control the selectivity of a given process, followed by subsequent removal and recovery of the auxiliary. We have previously developed efficient methodology that employs an alternative auxiliary approach using an asymmetric Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction of chiral substituted anthracenes. This methodology has been very successful for a number of alkene substrates and we have developed efficient chemical syntheses of several classes of natural products. This project aims to considerably widen the scope and applicability of this process by developing the first catalytic asymmetric Diels-Alder cycloaddition of anthracene and its derivatives. We aim to conduct a series of optimisations to map the reactivity and selectivity of appropriate anthracene and alkene substrates. Once this has been performed we will conduct asymmetric transformations of the products obtained, in particular looking at Grignard additions and enolate alkylation. The chemistry developed will then be applied to the preparation of two structurally related natural product targets to showcase the efficiency of the overall procedure. In parallel to the work described here, we will also aim to develop alternative catalyst systems based up cis-2-amino-indan-1-ol, a catalyst precursor for which we have considerable experience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>126490</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Development of the proposed methodology using the catalyst was challenging as many of the catalyst systems were found to be extremely air and moisture sensitive, requiring the need to work under inert an atmosphere using glovebox technologies. Nevertheless, proof-of-concept studies were conducted and were reasonably successful in preparing small molecule building blocks in reasonable efficiency. Further work moving on from this was more challenging, primarily resulting from a laboratory move that hampered the reproducibility of some the key transformations. A number synthetic transformations were conducted on model materials, demonstrating some useful transformations for the construction of heterocyclic systems. Should breakthroughs be made in the key catalytic technology then this would be an appropriate showcase for this chemistry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>At the moment, the proof of concept studies require specialised equipment that may not be available to many research groups. Ongoing chemistry is looking to develop milder reaction conditions to help aleviate this bottleneck.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>563D2DC7-102F-4FFF-A981-3826221B1F02</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7415250630.504685774d5a96</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://simon-jones.staff.shef.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3E6408A-2296-4E1B-8593-8B72D4D97F55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Enantioselective synthesis of allylic alcohols via an oxazaborolidinium ion catalyzed Diels-Alder/Retro-Diels-Alder sequence.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66"><gtr:id>6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1523-7052</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d01c01c35d46f3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/D078474/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
