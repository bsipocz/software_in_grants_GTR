Calculating the disparity between the left and right stereo images - aka stereo correspondence matching - is the most challenging stage in stereopsis applications. Biologically, the human brain achieves this task by employing a multichannel, multiresolution mechanism, recognising the fact that natural visual scenes contain detail information in several resolutions. Discrete stereopsis can be carried out both in the spatial domain and the frequency domain. Spatial image processing techniques offer perfect localisation in space but no localisation in frequency. Traditional image transforms achieve perfect localisation in frequency but no (or very poor) spatial localisation. Wavelets were the first modern transform to offer a hierarchical, multiresolution approach, which combines the best of both worlds: a space-frequency hierarchical multiresolution decomposition of the original image, with both local and global spatial support (section 2.3). They rapidly became a popular choice for stereo correspondence. To achieve optimal performance in the context of stereo correspondence, a wavelet should ideally simultaneously posses the following properties: orthogonality, locality (i.e. compact support, smooth filters and a large number of vanishing moments) and symmetry. Unfortunately a wavelet can never possess all these features simultaneously. Fortunately, this is not the case for multiwavelets, a relatively new, multichannel competitor of the (scalar) wavelets. In spite of the fact that application-wise multiwavelets are a rather under-researched topic, they have been already proven to perform better than scalar wavelets in many applications. Furthermore, there are different types of multiwavelets available: separable vs nonseparable, balanced vs unbalanced, symmetric-symmetric vs symmetric-antisymmetric which decompose an image in different ways.This proposal focuses on investigating the use of, and objectively evaluating the different types and families of multiwavelets in the context of stereo correspondence. The end objective of this proposal is to implement a hybrid, multiresolution-based stereo algorithm for video, which takes advantage of the properties exhibited by multiwavelets. An immediate application area of this research would be stereo to 3D (2D+depth) conversion in order to ensure interoperability between the various 3D facilities in our Fused Media Lab. Another equally important objective of this research is to evaluate its possible commercialisation routes in partnership with our industrial collaborators as well as to disseminate and promote the use of multiwavelets in the wider research community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>193254</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Wavelets (aka scalar wavelets) have been successfully used in stereo vision applications for a number of years. However, they cannot simultaneously possess a number of important properties essential for optimal correspondence matching. Multiwavelets however, which can be regarded as a multichannel version of the classic scalar wavelets, can possess most of these desirable properties simultaneously. The aim of this proposal was to investigate the use of multiwavelets in stereo vision applications and determine if they are a suitable proposition for stereo correspondence purposes. 

To this extent, different types and families of multiwavelets were assessed and compared against scalar wavelets. This research has shown that unbalanced multiwavelets generally give better results compared to balanced multiwavelets. Multiwavelets can also employ different types of filters. While symmetric-symmetric multiwavelets seem to produce only slightly better results compared to symmetric-antisymmetric multiwavelets, largely speaking this property of the multiwavelets doesn't seem to have much effect on the resulting disparity maps. In addition to these particular aspects, multiwavelets have a number of other differentiating features not investigated as part of this research which are worthy of further investigation. 

Overall, results indicate that multiwavelets can be a serious contender to scalar wavelets, producing smoother disparity maps with less mismatch errors compared to applying similar algorithms in the wavelet domain. This is due to the different spectral content of the multiwavelet sub-bands and the greater sub-band structure flexibility afforded by multiwavelets. In the investigator's opinion, the use of multiwavelets in stereo correspondence remains a relatively under-researched area deserving further investigation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the investigator's opinion, the use of multiwavelets in stereo correspondence remains a relatively under-researched area deserving further investigation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5BD6F0E9-BCAA-457F-941F-5C6C5B1D4476</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d82018851f85.15769675</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3D80EBD6-4224-48E5-BFA8-6DCF528C96DE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multiwavelets in the Context of Hierarchical Stereo Correspondence Matching Techniques</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81"><gtr:id>fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bagheri Zadeh, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c1d5972e352.11526028</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F867060-90FB-4A41-BE37-498B011B4F07</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Evaluation Of Multiwavelet Families For Stereo Correspondence Matching</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81"><gtr:id>fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bagheri Zadeh, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c1df79a0287.51659730</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E11339A3-2FDC-4822-B451-128496A0731D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stereo Correspondence Matching Using Multiwavelets</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c1c2b49acd2c942b91d58680c79edad3"><gtr:id>c1c2b49acd2c942b91d58680c79edad3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zadeh P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4244-7271-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>541c1b59b9f928.01528651</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC0809ED-7FD4-4BDC-B364-A4F7B4034EA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stereo Video Disparity Estimation Using Multi-wavelets</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81"><gtr:id>fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bagheri Zadeh, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c1cf464d3e9.00617219</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>49B7D772-6E24-4A44-BA0E-CEE4948CB3B9</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Hierarchical Multiwavelet Based Stereo Correspondence Matching Technique</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81"><gtr:id>fa2f9b1d4023b2762ae88f6a051dba81</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bagheri Zadeh, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c1db65a86c8.32057060</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G029423/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
