In order to optimise buildings for energy and health it is important that we have a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of indoor air flow, which is complicated by the impact of human behaviour. Current knowledge of how humans interact with their environment and implications for the airflow within buildings is virtually non-existent. This proposal aims to develop facilities for investigating the detailed fluctuations of air movement due to occupants opening and moving through doorways. This will have a significant impact on the understanding of contaminant transport and fresh air ingress into buildings; it will also have implications for ventilation specification and simulation as well as building energy prediction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is growing evidence that we may require greater levels of fresh air in our buildings to avoid 'Sick Building Syndrome'. Considering the amount of time we spend within buildings in the western world it is imperative that our indoor environments are designed to maintain high air quality and comfort, to ensure health, well-being and productivity. However, this is at odds with the need to radically reduce the energy consumption of our buildings and in order to achieve these two apparently conflicting goals it is important that we develop more in-depth understanding of our buildings and create design tools that represent realistic environments, particularly incorporating the influence of human occupants. This research will provide evidence and develop methods of taking occupants into account. 
The main long term impact of this research is to inform engineering design and building regulation and to have a direct impact on the UK's ability to reach its carbon reduction target whilst maintaining and improving the health and wellbeing of the population. This will be achieved through gathering evidence, developing tools and disseminating this to relevant audiences. Regulations on pollutant emission and dilution in indoor environments are likely to develop in the light of the recent World Health Organisation guidelines for Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). Therefore a fuller understanding of the indoor environment will become increasingly important to clients and building designers. This proposal represents a significant step in tackling the gap in knowledge and tools to answer fundamental questions about IAQ. In the short term the research will develop tools for incorporating the effect of human movement in the design of buildings, raise awareness of the importance of IAQ in building design and train new researchers in this area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F7D63A9-4CA9-4FF1-A6F5-701F0D921EF5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity was a seminar day run in collaboration with the CIBSE Natural Ventilation group &amp;quot;Accounting for Human Activity in the design, prediction and operation of buildings&amp;quot;.

This project developed a facility to begin to evaluate the role of human activity on indoor air flow and the resulting movement of pollutants. The facility consists of a water bath model, scaled specifically to evaluate the mixing generated by occupants in their everyday activities. Within this project the exchange of air between two rooms due to door motion was evaluated and the test procedure and scaling verified through the comparison with full scale results. Visualisations were used to understand the process of air exchange and mixing. The total volume of air transferred between rooms due to door opening and the parameters that affect this were quantified. Finally 3D particle image velocimetry was implemented to measure the velocity vectors within the fluid during door opening and closing. The project has resulted in rule of thumb guidance on the quantity of air moved between rooms which we have used to establish the risk of infection transfer between rooms in a variety of environments. The more detailed measurements provide information on air flow created during door motion which can be used to evaluate the risk of the draughts interacting with local extract systems and therefore can be used to ensure ventilation designs provide safe indoor air.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are useful in infection control to be able to quantify the risk of infection transfer between spaces separated by a door. It is also useful in the design of local extract systems as it provides evidence for the potential draught created when a door is opened. This means that systems can be designed safely to withstand this interaction, and reduces the requirement for over design. The findings also provide a wealth of data on the airflow generated by building occupants when they move between spaces. This information will be valuable for validating CFD and other ventilation models.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B239AF1E-BB1E-471C-8464-4DB5E09C9ECD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546241f404d846.61196316</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FF16A8AF-40DB-464E-919D-9DCC6B334CFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental and Modelling Investigations of Air Exchange and Infection Transfer due to Hinged-Door Motion in Office and Hospital Settings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VENTILATION</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/24eba1867c3c9bbdc1ba699b0ea42f7a"><gtr:id>24eba1867c3c9bbdc1ba699b0ea42f7a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hathway Abigail</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1473-3315</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a3519fda363c1.26342477</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1DCBFD02-EF82-423E-90DF-D81628A92C95</gtr:id><gtr:title>CFD SIMULATION OF AIRFLOW DUE TO DOOR MOTION USING A MOMENTUM SOURCE METHOD.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a3465e9aaf352c7f63486f62531600b2"><gtr:id>a3465e9aaf352c7f63486f62531600b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hathway A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56169dd53e0ba3.03111965</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>196BD1FA-82BB-466A-9CAE-1F2550A2C3FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards understanding the role of human activity on indoor air flows: a case study of door motion based on field and experimental activities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4fe34981cf7729b6486742be0c399fd8"><gtr:id>4fe34981cf7729b6486742be0c399fd8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hathway EA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5460c4a0423b77.84154577</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0B2D8CB6-143F-488B-A729-61F01EEFD5B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental and Modelling Investigations of Air Exchange and Infection Transfer due to Hinged-Door Motion in Office and Hospital Settings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Ventilation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a3465e9aaf352c7f63486f62531600b2"><gtr:id>a3465e9aaf352c7f63486f62531600b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hathway A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56169d0de17b17.44836435</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5144C130-0569-4113-8894-305110A6596A</gtr:id><gtr:title>An experimental study of the flow induced by the motion of a hinged door separating two rooms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Building and Environment</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/555638b8a824f2da84ccbafce94efd9d"><gtr:id>555638b8a824f2da84ccbafce94efd9d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Papakonstantis I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a66ec9c170d78.48628692</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K011669/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A99B6E4-F520-4600-BCB0-5F054BBCFB6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Building Ops &amp; Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
