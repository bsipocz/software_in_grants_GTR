Various attempts have been made to provide guidelines more appropriate to the developing world context; however, to date these efforts have been dominated by the fields of bioscience, medical research and nutrition. There is very little advice available for those seeking to undertake collaborative social science or natural science research in developing countries and what is there tends to be held within disparate sources. Charting the development of a set of ethics documentation for future use by the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme research community, this paper outlines past and present attitudes towards ethics procedures amongst this community and suggests ways in which ethics procedures might be made more relevant and user-friendly to researchers working in this area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The principle aim of the research was to produce an ethics form and accompanying guidance notes for the ESPA research community which would sensitize members to the ethical issues associated with undertaking collaborative research
in developing countries. 

The key findings were as follows: 
1. Participants accepted the importance of,
and need for, ethical review when undertaking collaborative work in developing countries, however, negative perceptions
of what this entails (e.g. time, effort, bureaucracy) and/or an ambivalence towards ethics has in the past meant that some participants had not taken ethical assessment seriously or had avoided it where possible. 
2. There is a particular need to raise awareness of
the relevance and potential benefits of ethical review amongst natural science researchers and/or those using modelling or secondary data.
3. Participants expressed dissatisfaction with the rigidity of Research Ethics Committee regulation and highlighted the difficulty of applying certain principles in developing
world contexts.
4. The ESPA guidance should facilitate a situated ethics which appreciated the need for flexibility and gave researchers the confidence and support to make in situ decisions without the need for further validation. 
5. There is a need to raise awareness of the mutual benefits and reassurances that can be derived from formal agreements
(e.g. in relation to IPR, collaborative relationships with non-academic partners, monitoring and evaluation procedures). Conversely, there is also a need to recognize
that long-standing collaborative relationships or blanket ethics clearance agreements between institutions may lead to complacency and prevent new projects from being ethically assessed on a case by case basis. 
6. Grant recipients must be encouraged and enabled to
build time into their projects to think about the practicalities of ethical research and share this information with their collaborating partners to form mutually agreeable parameters.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the research have already informed the development of a form set of ethics guidance notes for ESPA and could be used to inform the development of ethics documentation in other institutions.
