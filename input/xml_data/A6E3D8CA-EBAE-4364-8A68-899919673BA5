However, intermolecular potentials are difficult to obtain, and molecules with unpaired electrons further complicate the situation, especially when an unpaired electron can occupy two or more orbitals with similar energies.In our proposed work, we shall develop and assess the theoretical methods that we believe are the most promising for calculating intermolecular potentials of molecules with unpaired electrons, and apply the methods to interactions involving the chemically important molecule NO, whose unpaired electron can occupy two different 'pi' orbitals. These orbitals are equal in energy (degenerate) in the isolated NO molecule, but not when other molecules interact with it in weakly bound molecular complexes. We shall use a range of experimental methods to obtain information about these NO-X complexes, where X includes a number of diatomic molecules, rare gas atoms, and methane, and the NO molecule will be prepared in several different electronic and spin-orbit states.The work will involve collaboration between research groups at the Universities of Nottingham and Oxford, with experience in the calculation of intermolecular potentials, quantum chemistry of excited electronic states, and spectroscopy of Van der Waals complexes. The breadth and depth of this expertise, supported by collaborations with other leading research groups and by nationally-leading supercomputer facilities, offers the likelihood of substantial progress in this topical and exciting area of research. The spectroscopy of NO-X complexes will use microwave spectroscopy to obtain detailed information on the low-energy regions of the potential energy surfaces, and stimulated emission pumping to obtain information on the higher-energy vibrational and rotational states of the complexes in the ground electronic state. This will provide new information on the Van der Waals stretching motion and the hindered rotational motion of the complexes, and on the interplay between the spin-orbit interaction in the NO monomer and the Van der Waals interaction between the two monomers.Intermolecular potentials for the NO-X complexes will be calculated using a combination of the supermolecule method and new methods including intermolecular perturbation theory and the Maximum Overlap Method. The splitting of the spatial degeneracy by the intermolecular interaction makes these calculations non-standard and very challenging, especially for excited states and for polyatomic molecules X. From the intermolecular potentials, theoretical rotational and vibrational spectra will be predicted by solving the Schrdinger equation for the nuclear motion of the complex, including the non-Born-Oppenheimer effects that arise from coupling of the different spin-orbit states of NO by the intermolecular potential.The interplay between experiment and theory will be crucial, because the new theoretical methods can be assessed by their ability to reproduce the experimental data, and the results of the theoretical calculations will give additional, detailed, information on the potential energy surfaces, which cannot be obtained from the experiments. It is also expected, from our recent work on NO-methane and on the A states of NO-rare gas complexes, that the spectra will prove to be complicated and difficult to assign. The theoretical calculations will therefore be invaluable in understanding the experimental data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>445854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Modeling the NO(X2_)-Ar and NO(A2_+)-Ar van der Waals Complexes with Density Functional Theory</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>619AF538-8833-4AEE-A7EC-F96C7D82CE30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster at CAMD Summer School 2012 &amp;quot;Electronic Structure Theory and Materials Design&amp;quot;, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark

Rydberg states of NO were described well, but for the pi* valence states, large errors were observed. This is associated with the multiconfigurational nature of these states. The NO-Ar dimer was studied using density functional theory in the ground state and the first excited Rydberg state, using functionals with both empirical and non-empirical treatments of dispersion. A comparison with combined experimental and accurate theoretical data was made. For the ground state, several of the functionals gave very good results. Treatment of the excited state was more problematic. None of the functionals considered provided completely satisfactory results. Several reasons for this failure were identified: an incorrect description of the non-dispersion component of the interaction, and the damping of the dispersion interaction at small interatomic distances. The (2+1) REMPI spectrum of the C(2)_ state of the NO-Ar complex was measured and calculated. When the C(2)_ (3p_) state interacts with Ar at nonlinear orientations, the symmetry is lowered to C(s), splitting the degeneracy of the (2)_ state to yield C((2)A&amp;quot;) and C((2)A') states. For these two states of NO-Ar, calculated potential energy surfaces were calculated using second order M&amp;oslash;ller-Plesset perturbation theory and the maximum overlap method. The bound rovibrational states obtained from the surfaces were used to simulate the electronic spectrum, which was in excellent agreement with experiment, providing assignments for the observed spectral lines from the calculated rovibrational wavefunctions. Complexes involving NO interacting with molecules have complicated, coupled potential energy surfaces, even in the ground state, and more work is needed to understand their structures and spectra fully. Calculations on NO-CO and NO-N2 using coupled cluster, CAS-SCF and MRCI methods revealed that the Coulomb interaction between quadrupoles is usually dominant in determining the structure, which is roughly parallel in one of the two near-degenerate ground-state electron configurations and roughly T-shaped in the other. Bound rovibrational states were calculated from a preliminary fit to one of the ground-state surfaces and showed qualitative agreement with the infrared spectrum measured by a collaborator. The (1+1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectra of complexes formed between NO and the alkanes CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and n-C4H10 were measured in the ground state and A excited state. The spectrum was well defined for NO-CH4, but was only partially resolved for the other complexes. Binding energies and structures were deduced. Fragmentation of larger complexes, NO-(alkane)(n) was also observed, and their binding energies were obtained, with the conclusion that in the NO-(alkane)(2) complexes, the second alkane molecule is bound to the first, rather than to NO.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>NO is a molecule of great importance in biology and medicine. The way it binds to other molecules is complicated, and unravelling this complexity is vital to understanding its role in living organisms. We have used a range of experimental and computational methods to investigate NO binding and made a number of conclusions about how strongly and in what direction it binds to other molecules, and about which methods are more or less suitable for use in further studies.
