They are particularly devastating for high-value production crops, such as blackberry, apple and pear productions in the United Kingdom; grape vines in southern Europe; and palm trees in Africa, the Caribbean Islands, Florida and Mexico. They are also prevalent in wild plant species, and are associated with losses of native plants unique to some areas. Phytoplasmas are transmitted from plant to plant by phloem-feeding insects in which they are predominantly dependent on their plant and insect hosts for dispersal in nature. They have the unique ability to invade and replicate in their plant and insect hosts. Furthermore, some phytoplasmas, including Aster Yellows phytoplasma strain Witches' broom (AY-WB), manipulate plant species to become better hosts for phloem-feeding insects, including insects that normally do not survive on these species. Thus, apparently, phytoplasmas can interfere with plant defense responses to insect attack. Phytoplasmas also interfere with plant developmental processes as they can induce dramatic symptoms in plants such as witches' broom (growth of a dense mass of shoots from a single point) and phyllody (retrograde metamorphosis of the floral organs to the condition of leaves). Genome sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analyses have revealed that phytoplasmas produce a range of effector proteins of which some target plant cell nuclei and can perturb plant processes. In this proposal, we focus on the characterization of some of the effector proteins of AY-WB. We will determine whether these effector proteins are involved in symptom development and in increased attractiveness of plants to insect vectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Phytoplasmas are bacterial plant pathogens that predominantly depend on sap-sucking hemipteran insects, such as leafhoppers, for their dispersal in nature. They have the unique capability to replicate in their plant hosts and insect vectors, and are known to manipulate both for increasing infection and dispersal efficiencies. Many phytoplasmas have a broad host range. The phytoplasma studied in this proposal, Aster Yellows phytoplasma strain Witches' Broom (AY-WB), can infect China aster, lettuce, Nicotiana benthamiana, tomato, Arabidopsis thaliana and maize, and is also capable of infecting insects, such as its leafhopper vector Macrosteles quadrilineatus. Furthermore, AY-WB-infected plants are better hosts for potential insect vectors that normally do not survive on some of these plant species. In recent years, we made considerable progress in understanding the molecular basis of phytoplasma interactions with plants and insects. Mining of the complete AY-WB genome sequence has resulted in the identification of 56 secreted proteins (SAPs) that are potential effector proteins. Unlike Gram-negative bacterial plant pathogens, phytoplasmas do not require a type III secretion system. These bacteria use the Sec-dependent pathway for introducing effector proteins into host cells. Because phytoplasmas locate mostly intracellularly, they deliver secreted proteins directly into the host cell cytoplasm. One of the effector proteins, SAP11, targets the nuclei of plant cells and changes plant gene transcription profiles. SAP11 can unload from the phloem to target young developing plant tissues, consistent with the witches' broom symptoms that AY-WB induces in developing shoots. The SAP11 gene is located on a mobile region (the SAP11 region) reminiscent of a pathogenicity island that contains genes for 5 other effector proteins. In this proposal, we will focus further research on the functional analysis of the 6 effector proteins of the SAP11 region.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>532037</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Phytoplasmas have caused dramatic losses in many annual crop production areas, and are particularly devastating for high-value production crops. Rubus stunt phytoplasma is wide spread in cultivated and wild blackberries in many European countries. European stone fruit yellows, apple proliferation, and pear decline phytoplasmas are also prevalent, and in some cases have eliminated stone fruit productions. In addition, these phytoplasmas are quarantine organisms for export. The more than 100 members of the 16SrI clade that contains Ca. Phytoplasma asteris, collectively referred to as aster yellows (AY) group phytoplasmas, are vectored by at least 30 often polyphagous insect species and, as a consequence, are capable of infecting over 300 species in 38 families of broad-leaf, herbaceous plants and several woody fruit crops. Phytoplasmas of the AY group occur worldwide. The phytoplasma strain that was investigated in this proposal (AY-WB) is a Ca. Phytoplasma asteris species. 

In this project we identified and characterized genuine phytoplasma virulence proteins (effectors) using a functional genomics approach. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that pathogen effectors are capable of reaching beyond the pathogen-host interface to modulate a third organism in the biological interaction.

This project impacted society at several levels: (A) Interactions among science disciplines; (B) Training of young scientists; (C) Communication of science to (inter)national science communities; and (D) Engagement with the general public.

We identified 56 candidates, which were named secreted AY-WB proteins (SAPs). We hypothesized that the 56 SAPs are candidate virulence proteins (effectors) that modulate processes of the AY-WB plant host and insect vector. In this project we provided experimental evidence for this hypothesis. 

Firstly, we optimized use of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to study the tritrophic interactions of plant, AY-WB phytoplasma and insect vector (the aster leafhopper Macrosteles quadrilineatus). We found that AY-WB phytoplasma infection induces witches' broom (excessive proliferation of stems from a single point) and phyllody (flowers that revert into leaves) symptoms in A. thaliana. Moreover, we found that the aster leafhopper readily feeds and reproduces on A. thaliana and that this leafhopper reproduces better on AY-WB-infected than on non-infected A. thaliana. Finally, we found that AY-WB-infected plants become feeding and reproductive hosts for the corn specialist leafhopper Dalbulus maidis, whereas these insects die on non-infected A. thaliana. Thus, AY-WB phytoplasma infection induces similar symptoms in A. thaliana as in native hosts of AY-WB, i.e. lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and China aster (Callistephus chinenses). 

We previously found that A. thaliana transgenic lines producing phytoplasma effector SAP11 exhibited crinkled leaf and witches' broom phenotypes (BBS_E_J_000CA317). To assess if other phytoplasma effector proteins also modulate plant development, we generated stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines for additional SAPs. We found that SAP54 transgenic plants displayed leaf-like flowers similar to those observed in AY-WB-infected plants. The SAP05 lines showed changes in leaf morphology, the production of aerial rosettes and an apparent loss of apical dominance.

In this project we also discovered that phytoplasma insect vectors, the aster leafhoppers, produce more progeny on the SAP11 lines compared to wild-type A. thaliana. In addition, the corn leafhopper D. maidis survived longer on SAP05 A. thaliana lines. Thus, individual SAPs induce the various phenotypic changes that resemble symptoms observed in AY-WB-infected plants. 

To determine how SAP11, SAP54 and SAP05 induce the phenotypes, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screens against an Arabidopsis seedling library. This revealed that SAP11 interacts with plant TCP transcription factors. SAP11 interactions with TCPs were confirmed by in planta co-expression and pull-down assays. We found that the SAP11-mediated destabilization of specific TCPs induces curly leaf and witches' broom phenotypes. These TCPs are positive regulators of jasmonate (JA) synthesis, which is a phytohormone that regulates plant defense responses to phytophagous insects, including leafhoppers. JA synthesis was downregulated in the SAP11 transgenic plants and in AY-WB-infected plants and the aster leafhoppers produced more progeny on these plants. Thus, the SAP11-mediated destabilization of specific TCPs appears to contribute to the witches' broom symptoms and increased leafhopper susceptibility of AY-WB-infected plants. 

The yeast two-hybrid analyses also revealed that SAP54 binds to MADS-box transcription factors, which regulate flower development, and that SAP05 binds to GATA transcription factors, which regulate meristem identity. SAP54 and SAP05 functions were further investigated in project BBS/E/J/000CA452. 

Finally, we have generated antibodies to a number of AY-WB phytoplasma effectors. The SAP54 antibodies were used to demonstrate that SAP54 interacts with MADS-box transcription factors during phytoplasma infection in project BBS/E/J/000CA452.

Altogether, this project demonstrated that we have identified and characterized genuine phytoplasma effectors using a functional genomics approach. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that pathogen effectors are capable of reaching beyond the pathogen-host interface to modulate a third organism in the biological interaction, the leafhopper vectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Results generated in this project lead to additional project funding, including BB/K002848/1 and BBS/E/J/000CA452.
