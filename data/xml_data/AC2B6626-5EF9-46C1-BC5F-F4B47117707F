As a result, this research addresses conceptual and methodological challenges by strategically and intelligently mining new data resources in order to build an empirically rich and theoretically informed epidemiology of the social. What makes some things, viruses or affects, affective?&amp;nbsp; What gives them a propensity to move, transform and infect? Can we reach some conclusions on transmissibility, its spatial and temporal variations?

To that end contagion involves an international and interdisciplinary team working collaboratively to explore three contagious phenomena (influenza, food scares and finance), in order to refine methods, explore spatial analysis and theory, to compare contagious domains and identify avenues for further work and impact. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Understanding the predictability or otherwise of contagions will have huge impacts in government, marketing, health planning, financial and public sectors. Partnering with FSA and AHVLA will enhance knowledge transfer. Co-development of tools will be explored, along with other pathways to impact, with public as well as commercial bodies through workshops and a steering panel. 

Types of beneficiaries include:
International social and soci-veterinary sciences interested in the use of big data and the theoretical advances in bio-social contagions.
Public sector - public health professionals, food safety organisations at national levels. The ability to influence and intervene in contagious domains is of direct relevance to a variety of public bodies. The methods and approaches may be transferrable to other domains (social order, security, social network analyses) as well as to the commercial sector.

Types of impact:
impacts may include health and well-being in terms of developing better capacity for understanding and acting on infectious disease and food scares.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200924</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1. The socio-economic approach to pathogenicity has been elaborated at length in the forthcoming monograph Hinchliffe et al 'Pathological Lives' Wiley/ Blackwell. The working group that developed these ideas in relation to avian influenza research at Animal and Plant Health Agency continue to develop models and approaches to animal health risks. Dr Richard Irvine, a partner in this research, is developing a new approach to animal veterinary surveillance in his new role as Head of Surveillance Intelligence Unit and Scanning Surveillance Programme. This approach incorporates not only traditional pathogen-centred information but also incorporates socio-economic information on the value chain. Hinchliffe's role on Defra's Exotic Diseases Scientific Advisory Committee involved stressing the links between contagion and the socio-economics of production. 
2. Sandover's (the project's PDRA) work on analysis of social media as a means to gauge and respond to contagious events (in this case the Somerset floods) has been published in the Royal Society for the Protection for Birds (RSPB) &amp;quot;Flooding in Focus: Recommendations for more effective flood management&amp;quot; http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/flooding-in-focus_tcm9-386202.pdf. The report, and Dr Sandover's contribution, recommends that &amp;quot;greater recognition is needed from public bodies of the benefits of social media in community response to floods, with strategies implemented to achieve this&amp;quot;. The report has been picked up and reported by ADA (The Association of Drainage Authorities).
3. The use of social media within the Food Standards Agency continues to lead the field, with the Contagion project an early input into the development of surveillance tools designed to provide early warning of norovirus outbreaks. Hinchliffe is continuing his input into the FSA's social science research committee and has recently joined a working group on the social risk of norovirus and other food borne viruses with the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food. He is co-author of a report to ACMSF and FSA on developing social research on food borne viruses. The social media work as well as broader concepts relating to the social aspects of viral transmission and pathogenicity were used in the development of this report and the research programme that follows.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>08B704CA-EF57-4E3A-9BE0-DEB5BE9A346A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544fb934dd4c77.75151203</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The findings or developments can be grouped under three headings: social media analysis, infectious diseases and a synthetic, theoretical and spatial understanding of contagion.

1. In terms of social media we have developed a process for social scientists to handle, clean and analyse spatial structure in large social media data sets. The process is reported on our website and involves the use of open source and free software. Through this set of techniques, we have analysed the spatial structure of social media data and demonstrate that far from being a matter of the spread of ideas in digital space, contagion is characteristically a matter of a series of relays and interfaces whereby repetition and difference account for the production of social change. In that sense, contagion in social media is not simply a matter of memes or the distribution of discrete packets of information, it is rather an uneven process that takes place across a textured domain space. Contagion in social media is, in this sense, a relational achievement.

2. In terms of infectious diseases we have worked with virologists and epidemiologists within the Animal and Plant Health Agency on historical data sets of avian influenza viruses. Our aim has been to move from a 'contamination' or spread through contact model of contagion by looking for pre-dispositional characteristics that make contagion more or less likely. In simple terms, we have been looking at the role of host and environments in making a contagious process work. We have been looking for patterns in genetic data of viruses which can signal host-pathogen relations and matching these to known environmental and host character for outbreaks in Italy and Romania (as well as keeping up to date with current HPAI events in Europe and the US). The result has bee a shift away from pathogen-centered accounts of the disease and towards more social and ecological approaches to infections.
3. Finally, we have been working at a theoretical synthesis of these two bodies of work in order to re-frame what is meant by contagion within these and other domains. We are as a result generating an alternative approach to contagion that downplays contact and amplifies the role of repetition and difference in the production of social and biosocial life.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Main users are:
APHA - the work on the socio-ecology of disease is informing work on the strange communicability of AI in situations that may already be considered biosecure. There is in this sense a sceptical though interested group trying to re-think how contagion works in a multi-factorial fashion. This relationship is currently one of personal contacts with co-workers on the project, though the working relationship is a good one and we are already discussing alternative approaches to assessing risk in farm animal settings.
Social Sciences - we hope that the simple steps and relatively lo-tech version of social media data analysis that we have reported on the project web-page will be useful to researchers and students who wish to use social media data in their investigations.
Food Standards Agency - the FSA have been pioneering in their use of social media and its analysis in messaging and developing early warning of possible food borne illnesses. We have been involved in early stages of some of this work, and will continue to work with them on a Future of Food project that will take the findings of this project into new thinking on food and society.
RSPB - a member of the contagion team contributed to the RSPB's report on flooding, with a report on the use of social media in flood events.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>85A2CB44-CF51-4903-BB21-7C6EE4B5D1EB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fba1679b810.49773288</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://contagion.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1D5CD495-4CA0-43C1-92D0-B3D3C65DCFAC</gtr:id><gtr:title>More than one world, more than one health: re-configuring interspecies health.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social science &amp; medicine (1982)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/342f9635ddff6734be9063c877957c89"><gtr:id>342f9635ddff6734be9063c877957c89</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hinchliffe S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0277-9536</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>544fb5385b9dd8.01682210</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BF552DD9-EA7B-4849-B9BF-23BEC7925B36</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Arbitrage of non-knowledge: a response to Caduff's Pandemic Prophecy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle> Journal of Cultural Anthropology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/86093b1542fb02c71775d80430c3ce36"><gtr:id>86093b1542fb02c71775d80430c3ce36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hinchliffe, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544fb5c67edb87.57722012</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8893C1B7-DB02-4FA9-846E-7BDA920BD9ED</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pathological Lives: Disease, Space and Biopolitics</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e8717272f113000b5e2e61328ab6ca79"><gtr:id>e8717272f113000b5e2e61328ab6ca79</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hinchliffe Steve</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781118997598</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58b563133138d2.66525002</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>542884C6-9C51-40B9-806B-069CAFDB0057</gtr:id><gtr:title>One world, one health?
