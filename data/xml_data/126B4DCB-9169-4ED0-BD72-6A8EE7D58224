They have long been of interest for the porous channels in their structures, which enables a wide range of molecular gases to be separated and stored. More recently, however, they have begun to show tremendous promise for their electronic and magnetic properties, which are critical to underpinning many modern technologies and have long been associated with metal oxide ceramics. These properties include:
1. Ferroelectricity which is, the switchable polarisation of charge in a material such that it has a positively and negatively charged end. Ferroelectrics have applications in many industries, including medical and defence ultrasound technologies based on piezoelectric responses, where a material expands and contracts when in an applied electronic field.
2. Multiferroicity, where a material has both ferroelectric and magnetic order, which has great potential for ultra-high density memory storage in information technologies. 

Analogues of some functional oxide structures remain important for hybrid frameworks with electronic functions. This includes perovskite related structures, in which small octahedral metal cations are bridged by anions at their corners, with a larger cation, an organic molecule in hybrids, sitting in the spaces between this extended framework. The electronic properties of hybrid frameworks can, however, arise from fundamentally different origins than found in oxides; for example charged molecular cations in hybrid perovskites can exhibit ferroelectric order because of relatively weak supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen-bonding, between the molecule and the anionic framework. This enables them to be modified in unique ways, for example the ferroelectric response to applied electric fields in hybrids can be optimised to be consistent over a wide temperature range in a way typically associated with relaxor oxide materials, without introducing the complex mixture of cations needed for such oxides. The details of how such relaxor-like properties occur in hybrid frameworks is still unclear and it will be important to develop an understanding of this occurs in-order to be able to modify hybrids to optimise their physical properties.

As the interactions responsible for ferroelectric order in hybrid frameworks are much weaker than in oxides it is critical to increase the strength of these contacts. This will enable the molecular cations to adopt the ordering patterns required for ferroelectricity at higher temperatures, leading to the development of materials that operate at useful conditions, above room temperature. One route to achieving this is to maximise the difference between the electronegativity, the strength of attraction between an ion and an electron, of the smaller metal cation and the anions, which indirectly strengthens the supramolecular interactions responsible for ferroelectric order of the molecular cations. This proposal will probe two routes for achieving this goal by making hybrid perovskite frameworks where either the octahedral cation is a less electronegative magnesium, calcium or strontium cation, or the anion is more electronegative i.e. chlorine, bromine or iodine. These materials will then be screened for their ability to feature molecular cations with ferroelectric ordering patterns above room temperature and the physical properties of materials meeting this criteria will then be characterised to establish optimised ferroelectric performance. A combination of experimental and computational techniques will then be used to understand the link between atomic level structure and physical properties in these materials, with a particular focus on the unique way in which relaxor-like responses arise in hybrid frameworks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Ferroelectric materials are vital for many technological applications with significant potential for future growth. Relaxor ferroelectrics are particularly important as they are expected to find application in next generation sensing and high precision electronic motors. This project will develop a new class of ferroelectric materials functional at useful temperatures, with the potential of reducing our dependence on lead based materials that comprise the bulk of useful ferroelectrics, especially relaxors, at present. This project therefore has potential to have significant impact in the longer term underpinned by the fundamental science proposed. Impact can be anticipated across three principal areas of academia, society and industry:
1) Academic Impact: The research has an interdisciplinary focus on developing functional ferroelectric materials combining inorganic and organic building blocks alongside establishing an understanding of the unique way in which relaxor properties evolve from the distinct microscopic structure of these materials. This project therefore has the potential to have significant multidisciplinary academic impact across chemistry, physics and materials sciences. This will include groups interested in making new functional materials to those focused on studying the fundamental physics from which their properties evolve to groups involved in making ferroelectric thin film devices. 
2) Societal Influence: The most immediate societal impact will be centred on training the postdoctoral research associate (PDRA) and independently funded Masters student involved in the research. This will provide them with the opportunity to develop a range of synthetic, crystallographic and physical property measurement skills. More generally this project will also provide them with opportunities to further develop their communication, presentation and leadership skills. This will provide them with a unique base from which to develop an independent and versatile career as materials chemists. Additionally the PI aims to communicate key results generated during the course of this proposal both by incorporating some of these in his teaching at the University of Kent, both in lectures and short undergraduate research projects, and to a wider non-scientific audience at outreach events.
3) Industrial Impact: The project will develop a new class of useful ferroelectric materials, with potential for long-term industrial development and exploitation. As these materials are realised potential industrial partners will be identified in partnership with Kent Innovation and Enterprise (KIE), which already has a strong existing network of industrial links, to ensure that the UK benefits from potential commercial developments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101142</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R011524/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
