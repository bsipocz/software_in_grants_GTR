The NMMC now aspires to build on these successes, and connect communities with their more ancient maritime heritage by extending its exhibitions further back in time to reveal the long-standing nature of Cornwall's and British relationship with the sea, and develop its research capacity so that it can re-position itself as a center of maritime research excellence. This knowledge transfer project, a joint collaboration between the NMMC and University researchers, unlocks the expertise necessary for these aspirations to come to fruition. The academic archaeologists bring to this project their internationally recognized expertise in Bronze Age seafaring, the European Bronze Age, maritime archaeology and experimental archaeology; they are joined by a geo-engineer with specialist knowledge of 3D laser scanning and a media researcher with expertise in the creation of digital artefacts documenting transient events. \n\nThis project takes its inspiration from two maritime museums on the Continent (the Viking ship museum in Roskilde, Denmark, and the Batavia Wharf in Lelystad, Netherlands) that have at their core the 'live' construction of historical vessels. Both these organizations have attracted large numbers of visitors, and are recognized as contributors to their local economies and undertaking experimental research at the highest quality level.\n\nThis project has at its center the construction of a type of craft that is unique to the British Bronze Age (c. 2500-800 BC), and has direct relevance to local, regional and national audiences: the sewn-plank boat. The sewn-plank boat is the oldest archaeologically known seafaring craft in Europe. This type of craft played a key role in reconnecting communities in Britain with continental Europe and Ireland during the early phases of emerging trade and exchange in metals. The position of Cornwall in the exchange networks of the Bronze Age is undoubted. As an area with abundant copper and tin ores, Cornwall was of critical importance in the early bronze manufacture in northwestern Europe, and this notion was recently reinforced with the discoveries of Bronze Age tin ingots, off the coast of Salcombe. \n\nThe construction of a sewn-plank boat using Bronze Age technology and replica tools provides an opportunity to celebrate British prehistoric innovations in ship building and Cornwall's role in European integration, and to (re-)connect communities with their ancient maritime heritage. Visitors will be able to participate in its construction (thereto supervised by the Project Officer), discovering prehistoric technology for themselves. The construction of this craft offers a platform for building the research capacity of the NMMC, and this will be achieved through the recording of the emerging sewn-plank boat in both conventional and innovative ways, including using high-resolution 3D laser scanning and the creation of a digital artefact that documents the transient and dynamic nature of the project.\n\nThe boat will form the centerpiece of the temporary exhibition 'Cornwall and the Sea in the Bronze Age', that will offer the latest academic thinking on prehistoric maritime heritage and connections between Cornwall and Europe, and will exhibit key items from the collection of the Royal Cornwall Museum. Formal and informal education programmes of curriculum enrichment workshops, linking the exhibition to key learning outcomes in the National Curriculum for England, and a conference following testing of the sewn-plank boat, will be held in the museum. Crucially, this will provide the NMMC and other maritime museums with an innovative and transformational concept that can be replicated in the future for different types of craft, and dissemination of the concept of 'live' martime exhibitions will include two papers co-authored by the partners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's outcomes are designed to transform the experiences and attitudes of a range of different audiences. The beneficiaries of the project, in addition to the academic beneficiaries detailed in the previous section, include:\n\n1. The NMMC itself, its staff and volunteers, will be direct beneficiaries of the project, and this will take several forms. During the lifetime of the project, the exhibition and the 'live' reconstruction of a prehistoric craft at the NMMC is expected to attract more visitors to the NMMC than would otherwise be the case because of the very different nature of the exhibition and news stories on the project following the planned press releases, thereby contributing to the economic sustainability of the NMMC, transforming its capacity to (re-)connect communities with their more ancient maritime heritage, and building its research capacity and research reputation. Importantly, the NMMC will be provided with the experience of an innovative exhibition concept (that is the 'live' experimental construction of a boat) that can be repeated in future years for different types of craft, and this is expected to have a transformational impact on the NMMC and a lasting relationship with academic researchers;\n\n2. During the project, an estimated 125,000 members of the community of Cornwall and tourists in the southwest during the summer of 2012 will benefit from the project as visitors to the exhibition, gaining information on the earliest British seafaring innovation and early connectedness within Europe, that has remained largely the preserve of the academic community. Celebrating these aspects of Cornwall's and Britain's past enhances the cultural well-being of the visitors, and enhances Cornwall's status as a high quality tourist destination. The general public that can not visit the NMMC will be able to share these benefits through information provided on the NMMC website and publicized in the local, regional, national and international press;\n\n3. Museum volunteers, students and some 1000 visitors are expected to participate in the construction of the craft, thereto supervised by the Project Officer, gaining transferable skills in working with ancient technology, within a team, whilst engaging with the public. This will have a lasting impact on their understanding of their maritime heritage;\n\n4. An estimated 1500 children from primary schools and colleges within Cornwall will take part in a range of formal education programmes that will include specially designed learning activities linking aspects of permanent collections to the exhibition in the context of the National Curriculum (e.g. Design and Technology, History, Science). Informal education will also be delivered to adult visitors, including the attendees to the lunch-time 'Discovery Talks' presented by the Knowledge Transfer Fellows. These aspects are designed to (re-)connect local communities with their maritime heritage and support the development of the knowledge economy in Cornwall;\n\n5. The NMMC exhibition will include suggestions for exploring 'Bronze Age Cornwall', and heritage tourists attractions in Cornwall, notably to the Royal Cornwall Museum that will provide key items for the exhibition. It, and other organizations will benefit from additional visitors numbers, supporting their financial sustainability and cultural outreach;\n\n6. The commercial private sector in Falmouth will benefit from additional spending by visitors to the exhibition, and the project will strengthen Falmouth's vibrancy as a high-quality tourist destination;\n\n7. This project provides a case-study to the wider constituency of maritime museums in the UK as an example of how audiences can be reached, and how research capacity can be developed, in maritime museum contexts.

We have been careful to describe Morgawr not simply as a replica of Ferriby-1 (as has been done in the case of Oakleaf), but as a 'floating hypothesis' of a Bronze Age-type sewn-plank boat based on the Ferriby boats, using Ted Wright's and John Coates' description and published drawings of the 'complete boat' as a starting point, noting that this is itself a compilation of the remains of four different craft and that the resulting design has been disputed. The bottom structure of Morgawr closely resembles Ferriby-1 and the 'complete craft'. The main exception is the additional frame, placed over the keelplank scarf for added strength in what is the boat's weakest point. Morgawr's sides, however, are hard-chined, straighter and possibly stronger, and show a more straight-sided craft.



Reflecting on the Bronze Age ship-building technology, the bronze tools and especially the adzes worked extremely well in shaping or sculpting the timbers, and individual volunteers left distinguishable marks on the timber. Very few tool marks survived intact on the archaeological remains of the Ferriby boats (Wright, 1990: 38), and individual toolmarks which could have provided evidence of the number of axes employed in their construction were not recorded. The planks flexed a little, but could not be bent to the extent implied by Ted Wright and John Coates. As we considered that the planks were far too thick for steam-bending using Bronze Age technologies such as open fires or 'hot rocks', the only remaining option was to carve the three-dimensional shapes by chipping away excess timber with bronze adzes and axes. In building Morgawr we used patterns to ensure that the boat would closely resemble the 'complete boat', or at least provide a control to know what changes were introduced. Whether the Bronze Age shipwright used a similar technique is not known, but it is unlikely if applying the plank-first principle. If this was not the case, then each plank had to be handled and offered up many times before it was suitable for fitting and stitching. Moreover, the shipwright would have possessed an ability to visualize the three-dimensional shape of the boat and the approximate shape of each plank, a process that has been witnessed in the construction of traditional rafts and boats all over the world today (McGrail et al., 2003).



Following its launch, Morgawr has proven to be a reliable if awkward boat to handle, being extremely heavy and unwieldy but improving as our handling skills improve. Of course, there would have been fewer requirements for a craft in the Early Bronze Age to be steered accurately, as harbours would have been natural beaches and salt marshes, taking advantage of tidal movement to navigate between land and sea, without the requirement of jetties. Future trials will include tests on speed, manoeuvrability and handling, and how Morgawr behaves under different conditions of swell.



This paper highlights the process and challenges involved in building a 'floating hypothesis' and has sought to demonstrate the important contribution this experiment has made to our understanding of Bronze Age-type sewn-plank boat construction. However, it is clear that this is the start of a dialogue and that Morgawr only begins to provide archaeologists with an initial insight into the mind of, and the choices faced by, the Bronze Age boatbuilder.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The National Maritime Museum Cornwall has adopted the 'inverted exhibition' approach in its Viking Voyagers exhibition</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>495F83C1-0ED0-44EA-BA9B-AA4D0B2758E0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r_4429120774775f165a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nmmc.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>733B105A-4A2A-44CF-B910-9DB659545303</gtr:id><gtr:title>: an experimental Bronze Age-type sewn-plank craft based on the Ferriby boats</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Nautical Archaeology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4737ecb422eea45ea471840944da42b1"><gtr:id>4737ecb422eea45ea471840944da42b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Van de Noort R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d514bd553a7.74795810</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I02249X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AB6A2AB7-DA93-408F-8BD1-B2E98C555074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Maritime Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
