In a typical learning task an event is followed by an outcome, and the animal comes to learn that the event predicts the outcome. Associative theory explains this by saying that the mental representations of the two events become linked, so that presentation of the first can elicit the thought of the second - and this theory can explain how animals selectively encode the predictive relationships between events that are causally related, rather than those that co-occur by chance. But despite its explanatory power, associative theory cannot explain how, at the same time, the animal also learns when the outcome will occur (timing), and theories of timing have developed independently. It would clearly be simpler to have one theory to account for both forms of learning, and attempts to develop a unified model have been made by timing theorists. However, the resultant models are seriously flawed, because they are unable explain how animals can track causality. For this reason it would be better if associative models could be adapted to explain timing. This is the aim of the current proposal. One reason associative theories cannot explain timing is because they do not specify how to represent the temporal properties of an event, such as its duration. In associative terms, a stimulus is viewed as consisting of different mental elements, corresponding to its various physical characteristics (such as brightness, pitch or volume), and each stimulus element can enter into associations. The overall aim of this proposal is to test a new hypothesis, that time can also be conceptualised as a stimulus element. It will do so by asking three, more specific questions. First, can these postulated temporal stimulus elements gain associative strength, just like more orthodox stimulus elements? Second, do they show evidence of changes in associability - another property of a stimulus which, according to associative theory, mediates the effect of experience on the ease with which the stimulus can condition? Third, l will examine a process known as perceptual learning, in which exposure to two stimulus enhances the ease with which they can be told apart, and depends on the number of elements the two stimuli share. If my hypothesis is correct, then the temporal features of the stimuli can also produce these perceptual learning effects. These experiments should allow us to evaluate whether associative theory can conceptualise time as another stimulus element, in the way I have suggested. If it can, then this could form the basis of a modified associative theory that can also explain timing effects. This work has implications at a number of levels. The outcome will allow us to assess the extent to which an associative account of timing effects is feasible, and so be of direct relevance to all those interested in learning. It will also have implications for the many aspects of psychology that rely on learning theories, and as well as for areas outside psychology - for example, the study of learning in artificial agents uses models very similar to those used in psychology. Data generated by the experiments proposed should thus be of use to those developing theories of machine learning. The work also has significant clinical implications, as timing abnormalities are heavily implicated in several conditions, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. As the work described in this proposal aims at a more complete understanding of the nature of timing, this will aid interpretation of the symptoms of such diseases, and so increase the sophistication of the animal models used to model the cognitive deficits they produce. This will directly inform attempts to identify their neural basis, and to develop treatments, as well as suggesting potential cognitive tests for earlier diagnosis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Conditioning and timing arise together during the same learning tasks, yet theories of conditioning and timing have developed independently. Attempts to develop a unified theory have come mainly from the timing tradition, but their explanations of key phenomena, such as cue competition, are weak. The alternative, to develop associative theory to account for temporal effects, has been held back because there is no agreement on how to incorporate temporal factors within an associative framework. This proposal addresses this issue. Associative theorising views stimuli as consisting of different component elements such as brightness, pitch or volume. My hypothesis is that temporal information, such as stimulus duration, may be encoded as an element, just like the other physical properties of the stimulus. If this suggestion is correct, it implies that these temporal elements can acquire associative strength just like other stimulus elements, and generates predictions about the extent to which conditioning to one stimulus with certain temporal properties will generalise to another. The first section of the proposal investigates this question. Associative theory posits that stimuli can also possess a property called associability, which changes as a function of experience, and determines the ease with which the stimulus subsequently conditions. If time is a stimulus element like any other, then it should change in associability just like any other stimulus element. The second section investigates this prediction. The final section examines the phenomenon of perceptual learning, in which exposure to two stimuli enhances the ability to discriminate between them. I will examine whether temporal cues can undergo perceptual learning like more orthodox cues, and examine the further, critical question of whether this perceptual learning process enhances the ability to time the occurrence of an unconditioned stimulus signalled by these preexposed temporal cues.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond the benefits the proposed body of work will bring to the academic community, it is envisaged that this research will form a knowledge base for carers and others in medical support roles who work with clinical populations presenting with dementia. Recent thinking holds that measuring quality of life is a key index in understanding the impact of dementia [1], but doing so can be complex, because patients typically suffer significant cognitive declines in cognitive functioning including difficulties in learning and time perception. The ability to learn that certain environmental events are meaningfully correlated and the ability to estimate the duration of these events are core psychological processes - they allow us to structure and navigate our environment with ease and safety. These abilities become increasingly affected as we age and are particularly affected by neural degeneration. As this research is dedicated to understanding both learning and timing, both of which are adversely affected by cognitive decline, it is directly related to understanding the underlying nature of this decline, and so should be of value to medical support workers, and carers, who are often family members of those suffering dementia. The present global estimate for people suffering some form of dementia is approximately 24.3 million, it is estimated that cases will double in developed nations and increase by 300% in developing nations by 2040 [2]. This entails significant economics costs; current estimates are that dementia spending costs the UK in excess of 17 billion per year set to rise to 35 billion within 20 years. The resultant pressure on public financing will therefore be high in terms of NHS resources leading to a knock-on impact on other areas of national health and consequently society at large. Thus any step that increase the efficiency of the caring process could have significant financial implications. I intend to communicate findings to the wider public through public seminars under the Newcastle Science City project. Specifically the facilities available at the Centre for Life provide an ideal public forum through which to communicate with support groups and local schools through the STEM initiative. Coordination of these activities will be through the Beacon North East scheme which was set up specifically to bring University research to the wider community. In addition, the Alzheimer's Society hosts a weekly web magazine (Alzheimer's Forum) through which findings can be communicated to a lay audience, while Help the Aged provide advice and support to both carers and the elderly and would provide an ideal forum through which to communicate results. A further, cost-effective method of engaging with interested parties that I will utilise is through the webpage of Newcastle University; webpages are an effective means by which to rapidly communicate findings in the laboratory. The RA appointed will receive substantial training in a range of areas that have wide application outside science. Due to the novel ideas expressed in this proposal, the RA will benefit through enhanced problem solving, numerate and oral and aural skills; the ability to work with numbers and express ideas in clear and precise terms, both written and verbal, are highly desirable and transferable qualities. It is intended that the work contained in the application will form the basis of several research papers to be delivered at high profile national and international conferences. The work will help inform cross-discipline collaborations; most immediate areas where cross-disciplinary collaborations will be pursued are in fields of machine learning and in neuroscience, specifically on testing animal models of dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's disease).

We have shown that learning under conditions of temporal uncertainty (you know something is going to happen but not when it will happen) can be explained using associative principles. In other words, one event predicts a second event but depending on how accurate your estimate of when the second event will occur will determine how much you learn about the correlation between the events. We have also shown that preexposure to a stimulus without consequence (i.e. one event is presented alone - this leads to slower learning about the stimulus if it is subsequently paired with an outcome) can enhance learning about the duration of that stimulus. It was thought that repeated exposure to an event that has no consequence should prevent learning about the temporal aspects of the stimulus which permits us to learn to anticipate associated events.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings could plausibly be taken on by those interested in understanding how addictive behaviour is maintained and why individuals relapse. Basic learning such as that covered by the present grant have been used to develop theoretical models of addition by looking at how Pavlovian and Instrumental conditioning (PIT) interact. Both Pavlovian and Instrumental conditioning have been used to study timing and our findings concerning the importance of time and how it interacts with association formation could feed into this nascent area. We note that the role of temporal learning and PIT has not yet been explored but there is no reason why time should not play a role in this learning effect.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B75E76D6-4A3F-4F90-BA96-C29146ED0A9A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7605719769.67252140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Some of the output from this project has been used to modify an existing theoretical model from the machine learning tradition.
