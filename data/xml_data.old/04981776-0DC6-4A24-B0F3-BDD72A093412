The primary business of the project's partner, Digital Green, is to generate and disseminate videos co-created with farmers for farmers about sustainable farming practices. These videos provide a window into the world of small and marginal farmers in India. Within the UnBox Fellowship, the original Fellows worked with DG to re-conceptualise and improve upon their existing online Facebook game Wonder Village aimed at attracting and engaging a wider audience to their work to promote an understanding of small farmer's lives. Together with DG and in consultation with farmers the team came up with the concept for a game platform where the DG videos take centre stage. The proposed project will take this concept further to develop a digital prototype of a game platform that integrates DG's videos directly into game play with game mechanisms designed and tested to be most effective at influencing social change. 

While the small farmer is the symbol of the Indian countryside, their livelihood and existence is threatened by inequalities in the bargaining power of growers, financiers and distributors of food. Market-led economic reform in India threatens to intensify these inequalities directly linked to hierarchies of power that prevail across rural Indian society, related to caste, gender, religion and politics. Representation of farming takes a variety of forms in Indian media (e.g., rising food prices, GM versus organic debates), but perceptions persist of an urban-rural divide and of farmers as poor and plagued by suicide (Padney and Kaur 2009). The realities of farmers' lives in India remain relatively unknown and misunderstood by most web-connected urban users. Interviews with farmers during the first phase of this project, as part of the UnBox Fellowship, emphasised the need for the game to promote the message that urban users' own survival is interconnected with that of the small farmer. 

India has the third most socially active web-connected citizens in the world with fifth most Facebook users and 18 million twitter accounts. Recently published statistics indicate that 75% of web users in India are under 35 and 45% of these are mostly from urban areas and connect on social media to discuss politics (Shrinivasan and Anwer 2012). Recent research has shown that younger generations are increasingly using new social media tools for entertainment and self-gratification, but in moments of crisis, they are also using them to mobilise significant human and infrastructural resources to make immediate interventions (Shah 2011). While these users may remain ambivalent about identifying with particular political causes, this project aims to leverage that knowledge through a social impact game. By increasing their awareness and understanding of their implication in the crisis that is facing small Indian farmers, the game will be designed to motivate urban users to take action that can promote farmers', urban inhabitants' and India's socio-economic sustainability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19945</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Bumper Crop is a social impact board game created in both physical and digital platforms based on the experiences and challenges of being a small holding farmer in India.

This project helped them develop their vision and case for support for the development of a new virtual training framework. This project not only showed great potential for innovating strategies of training for both their mediators and farmers to share knowledge and develop skills and practices, but it also generated methods and tools, which are of direct benefit to their wider network of farmers, researcher partners, NGOs, foundations, government agencies, philanthropic foundations and India's Ministry of Rural Development who already played the game during the course of the project. While existing research has found that computer games can promote more direct, self-connection between players and game world events (Klimmt 2009), identification and empathy formation across cultural divides (Bachen et al 2012), influence self-efficacy or impact on motivation, perseverance for success or recovery from failures (Peng 2008), the project generated new knowledge by contributing (1) further evaluation of the efficacy of social impact games, and (2) a specific socio-cultural case study with global applications to related contexts of marginalisation. 

Furthermore, the iterative design process and evaluation methods employed offer innovative participatory methods of engaging diverse cultural experiences and expert knowledge, which are of direct benefit to games industry professionals in terms of co-designing appropriate, relevant and representative content/platforms for social impact games and game-based learning technologies. As such, the model developed herein will directly impact the wider games industry. 

The project successfully sustained, developed and expanded a creative and inter-disciplinary partnership between UK and India academics and practitioners working across cultures and disciplines of arts, technology and development. A diverse network of contacts was developed within the games industry and development organisations, which extended those of partners and researchers involved. 
Altogether, in line with the Nesta Next Gen report (Livingstone 2011), the project brought together expertise in arts and humanities research-led innovation and video game development to promote rigorous interdisciplinary approaches combining academic, commercial industry expertise, and a third sector organisation partnership to address real world challenges.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>529533DE-253D-46DD-9BA9-D9772E1A6ED4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56de254928a766.19954558</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Over the course of the research, the project partner's (Digital Green) objectives changed. A pressing concern became the development of a virtual training framework (VTI) and video-courseware. This would enable them to manage the up-scaling of their organisation to offer access to their services by partners across Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Therefore, questions about how 'gamification' might enhance and contribute to the improvement of their training methods became a more immediate and relevant concern than purely exploring ways to promote civic engagement and awareness through games, one of the original objectives of the project. 
Although game evaluations with farmers and DG mediators were originally intended as part of the project's participatory design methodology to develop the game concept and narrative in consultation and co-authorship with these core stakeholders, a physical game platform enabled the use of appropriate technology to physically playtest the game directly with this group. An important finding was that the game was extremely valuable to these stakeholders towards their own learning, knowledge-sharing and enjoyment. 
This led us to examine the efficacy of social impact games as tools and platforms both for advocacy and promotion of engagement with social issues, and for knowledge-sharing and learning of practices amongst communities and constituents. However, contrary to expectations, another key discovery was that the evaluations with young urban adults did not support the effectiveness of the physical board game to promote empathy. In fact, some players tested seemed to perceive less empathy, generally, after playing the game, and playing to win was more important than playing for its narrative content. 
In contrast, farmers and DG mediators' comments suggested they enjoyed the game and took it very seriously, because it strongly related to their own life, which demonstrated the game's potential as a serious device for their own learning of better agricultural practices and strategic planning and preparation. They also commented on the value the game would have to teach their own children how to farm. This led us to consider how serious games may be used as tools for engaging communities in sharing and learning practices and knowledge that may promote their resilience. 
While the digital platform may appeal more to young urban adults, further evaluation among this group to confirm or dispute this was beyond the scope of the iterative stages planned for this project. Additionally, we found that with the move from the physical to digital platforms, the game design lost many of its most engaging strategic features, which required more sophisticated coding and artificial intelligence than was achievable within the available timescale and resources of the project. Nevertheless, the development of the physical prototype as an innovative tool of communication and training enabled new potential purposes and audiences to be found within the gaming and development sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the research suggested that games may be useful for Digital Green and other similar third sector organisations as new methods (1) for training development workers to better understand and initiate dialogue with the communities they work with and learn and practice skills in facilitating groups and (2) for farmers to visualize and explore new strategies for improving their communities. As a result, DG is planning to include game-based learning within their new virtual training platform frameworks they are working on. Working with FoAM Kernow and new contacts developed through the project key project findings will be used to create an open source game design tool as a platform for peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing where bespoke game-based learning frameworks can be customised and designed cost-effectively by third sector organisations with appropriate technologies relevant to their training needs and contexts in developing economies. 

Another aspect of the project that may be put to use by others is as a method of presenting and transmitting intangible cultural skills and knowledge through art and digital technologies. This may be taken forward and put to use by others as a model for methods of digital scholarship, visual and digital ethnography and presenting, preserving and transmitting initangible skills and knowledge of cultural heritage.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3FB672C1-C628-40F1-9E58-1DEA54BE1D39</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cd3377713b76.91682671</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.playtogrow.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>New Training Methods for Digital Green</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92FBC829-0E43-458C-BBA6-822F9BD4BC5F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the game-based strategies developed through the Play to Grow project conducted with small-holding farmers in India and Digital Green mediators have shown the direct benefits of integrating game-based activity for training and knowledge-sharing in the development sector. As a result Digital Green will integrate such innovative methods into the development of their virtual training framework to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their service delivery, provide solutions to rural development problems, and improve the educational and skill level of farming communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56de4502eaacd1.52148291</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.digitalgreen.org/media/docs/events/Workshop_Report_India_March7.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7772873F-569D-4AAE-8ED8-512B68635AA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Play to Grow: Augmenting Agriculture with Social Impact Games, Report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd"><gtr:id>7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Myers, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>DOI: 10.4225/03/56E0C6B82C213</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56e0c919225885.93561965</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B38329E-454D-40B3-8030-2A6FBC0D6DCB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Play to Grow: Augmenting Agriculture with Social Impact Games Project Report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd"><gtr:id>7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Myers, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>DOI: 10.4225/03/56E0C51EABD15</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56e0c06ab8ce92.07866962</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>53E87F08-A70A-4820-BCE9-09C0F4DEE657</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sustaining Stories: Story in games for social impact</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd"><gtr:id>7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Myers, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e0cee3cf0f14.74122779</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>324DD384-A067-4548-9319-6349C6BABD4E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Play to Grow: Augmenting Agriculture with Social Impact Games, Report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd"><gtr:id>7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Myers, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>DOI: 10.4225/03/56E0C7EC24F6F</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56e0c9a5e2e7c7.35133236</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>31C7DA62-FAB7-4E2F-83B6-D444FDEC4662</gtr:id><gtr:title>Expanding Minds and Narrowing Divides in India through Gamivism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd"><gtr:id>7d2c924ec11cb2a914347debb491dfbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Myers, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e0d163a764e1.73599084</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L503605/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
