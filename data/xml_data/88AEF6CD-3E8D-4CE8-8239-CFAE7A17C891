&lt;p>It focuses on the uptake of web 2.0 tools by parties, candidates and voters and asks whether this process is fostering a new type of networked political activism&amp;nbsp;- citizen-campaigning - that challenges established modes of election behaviour and management.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>More specifically, do the new technologies of blogs, online video and social networking sites enable 'ordinary' voters to play a greater role in the coordination and communication of the campaign, thereby shifting power away from established elites, party members and activists?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If so, what factors help to promote this new type of activism at the individual, organisational and institutional level and what does it mean for parties, participation and the wider political system?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do the new forms of engagement ultimately strengthen the representative model government or encourage a more direct style of involvement by citizens and a by-passing of intermediaries?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research questions are explored using a range of original data including campaign sites, elite and public opinion surveys and new and innovative methodologies developed specifically for web 2.0 platforms.&lt;/p>

Specifically this included Trades Union Council, NetRoots UK, NGOS, parties, the BBC, MPs and their staff, MEPs, RAND Europe and Electoral Commission/Reform agency staff. Members of Obama e-campaign team, George Bush's e-campaign team, the Liberal Democrats, the UK and Australian Greens, National CWUYouth Committee contacted the project subsequently to request further information about our work. One of the Hansard Society organizers emailed the PI to say that the final conference event which included high-profile speakers from leading internet companies, PR firms, research institutes and Parliament itself &amp;quot;attracted large online audiences across social media&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;contributed to our continued partnership with Parliament Week and helped connect us to number of influential stakeholders within the digital industries.&amp;quot; We also helped inform local A-level pupils of the exciting nature of social science research and the new methods we are developing for web research through 2 invited talks, one of which was a 2012 ESRC Festival of Social Science sponsored debate and focused on who would win the U.S. Presidential election. Finally the online charity mySociety were a significant consumer of our research and on the basis of this agreed to participate in a Knowledge Exchange project to measure the social and political benefit of their sites.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>07526FA9-C0B2-411E-B02C-C1B49143471C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545930d399e972.85672141</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project ended in January 2013 and we are still generating key findings. In particular we are still analysing the French and U.S. data and so comparative conclusions are limited. Probably the three main substantive findings so far have been (1) that patterns of online participation largely replicate those found in offline behaviour. Something that has not been as explicitly and extensively tested prior to our project; (2) that the internet is mobilizing political engagement but in different ways - so use of the internet for political information is linked with increased conventional offline political activity such as voting compared with other types of uses which confirms and reinforces findings from other studies. The internet also appears to fostering a new type of e-expressive type of online political engagement that is heavily reliant on social media. This appeals to less interested and engaged citizens but does not appear to increase an individuals' likelihood to vote, suggesting a mobilization into more informal types of political activity may be occurring; finally (3) parties and campaign organizations are using the internet and particularly social media to build a more citizen-initiated model of campaigning that has the potential for decentralizing control of campaigns and helping them to generate new and much needed resources. The enthusiasm for this new model is tempered, however, by how strong and centralized parties are, since it allows non-members greater control over the party/candidate message and local campaign operations than has hitherto been possible. In addition the new data mining potential of social media appears to be increasingly driving much of the innovation and adoption by national parties and the ability to better target voters. These findings are important since they show that new citizens can being encouraged into the political process by the technology and also that it has the potential to make parties more open and interactive. However, the extent to which its democratising promise is actively being exploited by politicians and elitesn during elections is constrained by the institutional context and their inevitable focus on vote maximizing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work has already been discussed and disseminated in non-academic contexts. Specifically:



Conferences and Symposia

 - the 2012 International Electoral Affairs Symposium for election administrators and online election technologists to provide insight into how democratic publics are using the technology during elections and how to better reach them;

 - two Hansard events at the Houses of Parliament on social media campaigning for policy-makers and their staff, as well as media and the general public to help draw together other academic and non-academic expertise to show how parties and candidates other countries are using social media to campaign effectively

 - E-campaign events - Fairsay's annual Ecampaign Forum (ECF); the Netroots UK and Northwest conferences; and the TUC Grassroots Conference for Unions. All featured ecampaigners and activists from NGOs and third sector groups. The work was used as a means of helping them locate the digital campaign in wider historical trends of campaigning and reflect on the extent to which citizens are willing to use the new tools to help campaigns. 



Small one-off consultation exercises with NGOs and Charities - Save the Children, Electoral Reform International Services (ERIS)



Major consultation exercises - The RAND corporation report to the Bureau of European Policy Advisors (BEPA) which is a study commiissed as part of the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System (ESPAS) set up by the European Commission to examine future trends and develop policy that will meet EU states' needs in 2030. My work is being used to understand what types of participation will emerge online and how will political organizations such as parties and pressure groups change to adapt to these trends.



Schools - a debate for the ESRC Festival of Social Science held at a local sixth form college (Stonyhurst, Clitheroe) for students on the U.S. Presidential election campaign. I organized it and presented some of the findings of the project along with presentations of two other politics Professors. 



Charities - the findings for the project Basis for Knowledge Exchange Grant appplication with mySociety. An online charity that helps citizens locate information to help them address local community issues and also follow their councillors and members of parliament more closely and hold them to account.



Media - A headline article in the Guardian on the political uses of Twitter 'Is Twitter anything more than an online echo chamber?' August 22 2012. A report on the project commissioned for the ESRC annual magazine Britain in 2012. This research can be put to use in number of ways:

- By parties and candidates - the research shows that citizens' interest in official campaign material has increased significantly in elections held in the social media era. A small but significant number of citizens are downloading software and applications to help promote and campaign for candidates online or undertaking 'citizen initiated campaigning' as we term it here. Closer analysis of who these individuals are and how to recruit them and particularly to sustain them after the election campaign could help parties address some problems they face with falling membership numbers. In addition, we have the results of a unique online experimental analysis of voter responses to candidate and educational sites during the 2012 election that will allow insight into how effective this content is in stimulating political interest, voting and other types of political activity such as donating or contacting a public official. Finally, our results also show an increase in the extent of overall contacting by friends and family during elections since the arrival of the internet and particularly social media. Such contact may be particularly effective in that it comes from a trusted other. Parties and campaigns, therefore need to pay attention to developing ways that they can apply such two-step approaches to disseminating their message.



- By third sector groups and community campaigners seeking to engage more people in a cause or issue, particularly young people. At the same time that increases with formal actors' online presence is rising, our findings show that use of social media to exchange and comment on politics is of interest particularly to younger citizens and those typically less engaged. This more 'expressive' type of engagement does not appear to lead to an increase in voting but could be used to raise awareness of wider non-electoral political issues and lead to engagement in third sector or more informal political channels. Providing effective and easy ways to forward embed and share political content from one's site therefore would seem to be an important means of promoting a message online.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>212A2A95-A371-420B-AC55-5BEA63F00692</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1498839847.2767694b2f1e2d2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.projectcode.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>List of URLs included in several collections archived at Archive-it.
