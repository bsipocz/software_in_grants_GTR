&lt;p>It is predicted that group identification will have more impact on health than simple physical contact with group members. Moreover, the effects of group identification on health will be compared with the effects exerted by other factors known to predict health, such as socio-economic status and health-related behaviours.The degree to which the effects of group identification on health are independent from the effects of these other factors will also be considered. The prediction that the effects of group identification on health are mediated by perceived social support (ie, the extent to which group members feel they can rely on each other for assistance) will also be tested.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To achieve these aims, the proposed research will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>test a large sample of participants (N = ~16,000), drawn from two nations (~8,000 from Scotland and ~8,000 from Italy)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>use a longitudinal design (two waves across a two-year period: 2012-2014)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>use an extended range of physical and mental health indicators.&lt;/li>

2. Scottish Government contacted us to say that our research adds weight to the case that 'social connectedness' should be on the list of Performance Indicators on the National Performance Framework. Our suggestions of 'increase group membership' and 'increase social group membership' were also added to the list of potential Performance Indicators.

3. Findings were presented to the general public in a TEDx talk and interactive section that took place in Dundee on 23 May 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>84423609-9C9A-4D52-B64B-A99A994C991C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b60431a7de7.97584557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have now fully analysed the wave 1 data collected in Scotland (N=1824) and partially analysed wave 1 data collected in Italy (N=2005). We have found a number of important effects:

1. Within the Scottish sample, we found that the greater the number of social groups (e.g., family, local community, leisure group) one psychologically identifies with, the lower one's odds of being depressed. These effects are very strong even when controlling from other important variables such as level of education, marital status, age, and gender. However, we also found no association between one's frequency of contact with members of in-groups members and odds of feeling depressed and of being on anti-depressants. In other words, group life may be beneficial to mental health, but it is one's subjective sense of identification with groups that cures, not the amount of time one spends interacting with in-group members. Details of these findings can be found in a paper we have published in Social Psychiatry &amp;amp; Psychiatric Epidemiology: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-015-1076-4.

2. Within the Scottish sample, we found that the lower the number of social groups (e.g., family, local community, leisure group) one psychologically identifies with, the greater one's odds of adopting healthy behaviors (e.g, not smoking, not drinking excessively, eating fruit and vegetables in abundance, exercising regularly). These effects are strong even after controlling statistically for the impact of other important variables such as level of education, marital status, age, and gender. These findings are fully reported in a paper published in the British Journal of Health Psychology: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjhp.12119/full.

3. Within the Scottish sample, we found greater levels of education to be associated with lower number of received prescriptions for analgesics. Details of these results can be found in an article published in Psychology, Health &amp;amp; Medicine: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13548506.2015.1009377.

4. Within both the Scottish and Italian sample, we found that the greater the number of social groups (e.g., family, local community, leisure group) one psychologically identifies with, the greater one's odds of feeling satisfied with life.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>If confirmed by further studies, especially randomized controlled trials, our findings concerning the link between group identifications and depression would constitute evidence in support of the idea of 'social prescriptions'. 

Specifically, a health professional could present a depressed patient with a pre-prepared list of local social groups (e.g., sports or chess club, reading group, yoga, drawing, or foreign language classes), and encourage the patient to become a member of one or more groups with which the patient believes he/she would be likely to identify. The health professional could also encourage the patient to consider contributing to the creation and development of groups of which he/she would like to be a member, and with which he/she would be likely to identify. However, we need to keep in mind that, according to our findings, merely having contact with ingroup members will not produce any real beneficial effect unless that contact is framed by group identification (i.e., a sense of belonging to the group, coupled with a sense of commonality with its members). In addition, we suspect that high levels of contact with members of a group might even produce detrimental effects when people openly dislike, or actively dis-identify with, the group in question. 

The type of social prescription described above could be used in tandem with either medication or psychotherapy. However, a social prescription might be an especially viable option for patients who find psychotherapy unhelpful or unproductive, patients who do not want (or cannot take) antidepressants for the reasons discussed above, and patients who have tried antidepressants but have decided to discontinue taking them because of unpleasant side effects such as emotional numbing and sexual dysfunction. In such cases, we believe that health practitioners should consider a social prescription as a key tool for mental health promotion, particularly when there are reasons to believe that a patient's depression is caused mainly by social isolation or loneliness.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6E762451-729F-4B37-98D0-7ACA7E52009D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b61795a45f8.24911202</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://healthingroups.wix.com/healthingroups</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>23FB006E-E6DB-4638-BBFF-DA5AD9D69B21</gtr:id><gtr:title>Greater number of group identifications is associated with lower odds of being depressed: evidence from a Scottish community sample.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9eff829fb14219dc2da1fbc778afa57c"><gtr:id>9eff829fb14219dc2da1fbc778afa57c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sani F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0933-7954</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e62c793cc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4F8F3CD0-D471-4AAA-847D-C8DDECD2828A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Greater number of group identifications is associated with healthier behaviour: Evidence from a Scottish community sample.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British journal of health psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9eff829fb14219dc2da1fbc778afa57c"><gtr:id>9eff829fb14219dc2da1fbc778afa57c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sani F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-107X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545b6624730750.74090519</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C38D38AC-9FD3-4639-BA36-04BCC0D092A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social Isolation Predicts Frequent Attendance in Primary Care</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annals of Behavioral Medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1f3ca21ce93a26a161f5b8f48a964d24"><gtr:id>1f3ca21ce93a26a161f5b8f48a964d24</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cruwys T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a995c7eec3112.78781856</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>385226E0-2CA3-40F1-8A57-0098CA73E1E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The pain of low status: the relationship between subjective socio-economic status and analgesic prescriptions in a Scottish community sample.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychology, health &amp; medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8f575f4140d1b35926ad7d047bfe40ad"><gtr:id>8f575f4140d1b35926ad7d047bfe40ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wakefield JR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1354-8506</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675dfca09b4b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B16BBB16-FD76-4456-92C4-5B0C9A55E511</gtr:id><gtr:title>The relationship between group identification and satisfaction with life in a cross-cultural community sample.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Happiness Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/21aeeed03110fa2e30846d1397eec39d"><gtr:id>21aeeed03110fa2e30846d1397eec39d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wakefield, J.
