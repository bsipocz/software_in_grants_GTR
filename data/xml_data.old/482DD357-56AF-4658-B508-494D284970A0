The operation of the Welsh Language Commissioner, established April 2012, together with the impact of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, will be the principal focus. The work will concentrate on the first years of the operation of the Welsh Language Commissioner, which will be tasked with the establishment of national standards of Welsh medium services which are designed to improve on the current instrument of the Welsh Language Scheme, inaugurated under the Welsh Language Act, 1993.&lt;br />Detailed investigations of the Language Commissioner functions in Ireland and in Canada at both federal and sub-federal level are investigated to offer a comparative and heuristic perspective. The combined research is expected to benefit policy advisers and public servants in the named jurisdictions and others interested in the application of equality measures, human rights, official language promotion/regulation and community empowerment in Europe and North America. &lt;br />The methodology will combine archive work, literature and document review, field-work and interviews with Language Commissioner Staff, Parliamentary and other Commissioners, politicians, constitutional lawyers and a range of public servants.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Plan Communication and Engagement. The project is designed to have a national and international impact on the professional community as well as influencing the work of language officers and middle-managers in public administrations charged with delivering bilingual services. The research findings, strategic observations and recommendations will be communicated through the preparation of detailed evidence-based interpretations, the maintenance of a document archive on the Language Policy and Planning Research Unit website, the publishing of academic papers and books, addressing international/national conferences, professional and community-related events, the briefing of civil servants, briefing for Welsh public servants and hosting workshops and conferences both by the LPPRU and by other related centres in Cardiff, such as the Wales Governance Centre which the PI co-founded in February 1999. Collaboration. This work will have a significant impact on the operation of the Language Commissioners and we have secured the full cooperation of the WLB, the Canadian and Irish Commissioners. Williams has undertaken 350 hours of interviews with government officials, Commissioner staff, academics and voluntary organisations in the three jurisdictions, and established good working relationships with the Project Partners. During face to face interviews between October 2009 and January 26th 2011, Williams discussed the ethical, practical and procedural methods of selecting material from their archives, recording the nature of the complaints investigated in an anonymous manner and using the resultant data in published works. Both the WLB and the Irish Commissioner have welcomed the possibility of the PDF gaining work placement experience in the compliance investigation unit. While the PI and CI will deal with the meso-level impact of the project, the PDF's interpretations should feed into the detailed improvement of the operations of these agencies.This collaboration is based on the PIs extensive track record of advising government in Wales and Ireland; on his role as strategist for the WLB (2000-2010), now as consultant; advising UK and WAG governments on issues such as bilingual education policy, community development, Wales in Europe; on the successful adoption of recommendations made in, &amp;quot;The Bilingual Character of the National Assembly of Wales&amp;quot; May 1999-2001 (ESRC Award Number R000222936). This work was given the highest rating possible by the ESRC assessors and led to a marked improvement in the structure and bilingual operation of the National Assembly for Wales. He has also been involved in collaboration with Irish voluntary and governmental initiatives, most recently in co-authoring the draft of the Irish state's '20 Year Language Strategy' which was launched in December 2010.Exploitation and Application. Collaborative agreements exist with the Project Partners who have been fully appraised of the project's remit, who will be undertaking what type of research, for how long and with what sort of constraints on confidentiality and final reporting of the material and documents gathered. Detailed discussions have been held on issues such as access to government documents, case study notes, the electronic processing of complaints and investigations. Language Commissioners are interested in how their performance is interpreted by other agencies and citizens and this relationship will form an integral part of the work. Both the PI and CI have unrivalled experience in engaging with Irish and Welsh language agencies, invaluable in mentoring the PDF to develop appropriate skills and liaise with officialdom, while securing vital opportunities to engage publicly.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>343605</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Ireland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Office of the Irish Language Commissioner</gtr:department><gtr:description>International Conference of the International Association of Language Commissioners, Galway, March 7-9, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA7E159D-F13A-4E81-8845-20CECE45E450</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Rapporteur's Report from the 2016 Conference will be available mid-Summer 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c6f37b59a556.04075530-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided material, the opportunities for interviews and networking.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Advised on the content and themes of the International Conference of the International Association of Language Commissioners, Galway, March 7-9, 2016</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Catalan Ombudsman (S?ndic de Greuges de Catalunya)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>IALC Inaugural Conference</gtr:department><gtr:description>International Conference of the International Association of Language Commissioners, Ottawa, May 22 2015</gtr:description><gtr:id>C8B94B55-347E-49F8-A22B-773ACE4131DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rapporteur's Report from the Dublin (2012) and Ottawa (2015) meeting.

It comprised a two hour presentation by Prof Williams on the relationship between the promotion and regulation of Official Languages in Canada, Ireland and Wales. This offered a critical overview of the lack of joined up thinking by selected government departments as they sought to implement official language strategies.The Canadian policy makers and regulators were particularly interested in the development and implementation of the suite of Welsh Language Standards currently entering Welsh public life. There is some scope for the adoption of a similar system in Canada.

Several of the participants were keen to develop further the lines of enquiry opened up and this has resulted in a return invitation to Ottawa in 2016 and to new sets of relationships especially with Canada Heritage and the Treasury Board of Canada which share responsibility for the promotional work on Official Languages.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55c4a5604ac2d5.35228453</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Conference on Cultural Rights and Democratization, University of the Basque Country, 23-24 November 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2575350C-1B02-4E9D-A3A3-328168E7B735</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The conference was a joint collaboration between a number of universities in Spain and France with a particular focus on the condition of the Basque language in comparative context.

Wales
The research challenges current thinking through our assertion that the institutional architecture of the regulatory regime and organizational structure of the WLC are not fit for purpose. There is a conflict of interest between the First Minister and the Welsh Language Tribunal, and there are insufficient checks and balances on the operation of the WLC office. Our examination of the policy development and legislative cycles revealed that the scrutiny of evidence was insufficiently robust, it failed to identify partial evidence and explore some key issues. It is constitutionally unsound for the WLC, as a regulator, to be under a duty to critique Welsh Government policy as well as the overlap between the two with regards duties to promote Welsh. The evidence argues for a substantial revision of the Welsh language regulatory regime in its totality, including via legislation.

Ireland
The implications of the regulatory functions of the Language Commissioner are ill-understood by key actors in the Executive, the Legislature and indeed by the Language Commissioner. As a regulator, the Commissioner ought to be independent within the State, but not independent of it. There is a strong case for re-modelling the corporate structure of the office of the Language Commissioner to that of corporation aggregate. During the policy and legislative cycles which created the office of the Language Commissioner, and the Government's review of the 2003 Act, very limited use was made of expert evidence and distinctions between expert and activist evidence were often substantially blurred. These stages were informed by weak and partial evidence particularly on the strengths and weaknesses of Language Schemes. There is a failure to pay sufficient attention to the Gaeltacht as a feature of the Irish language regulatory regime, contributing to language shift towards English.

Canada
Canada's well-established OCOL has less room for improvement than Wales and Ireland. Our research recommends that OCOL should adopt a light-touch scrutiny of well-functioning Government departments so as to concentrate on more problematic non-compliance cases. OCOL should include detailed assessment of the linguistic profile of an organization in its Report Cards methodology. OCOL should introduce assessment of balance between the proportions of Anglophones and Francophones employed in Federal Services, their levels of satisfaction with language of work, and citizens' views on language of service. Systematic interviews conducted with key members of Official Languages Communities to see how they view progress in the provision of Official Language Services. Research on OCOL clients should be extended as the definition of who counts as a 'francophone' is being widened and would allow for the views of new immigrants and 'invisible' members of Canada's official language communities to be gauged.

Key Findings Report October 26 2015
What have you discovered or developed through the research funded on this grant? Please explain for a non-specialist audience.
The research team have analysed a range of data which allows them to interrogate the role, remit and function of Language Commissioners in Wales, Ireland and Canada, The project has sought to identify to what extent and how under specific circumstances the Language Commissioners play an active role in the regulation of aspects of language policy and the protection of language standards, schemes and rights. The research has developed a suite of thematic outputs which address issues such as the establishment of a Language Commissioner's Office, complaint handling mechanisms and investigations, the application of language schemes, language standards, the passage and implementation of language legislation, the independence and accountability of Language Commissioners.
The overarching aim of the research was to produce a number of scholarly outputs that will contribute to developing a better understanding of the characteristics of (i) a good regulatory environment, (ii) a high performing regulator, and (iii) regulatory practice best practice, along with (iv) the means of realizing effective regulatory outcomes in relation to offices of Language Commissioner in general and the offices of the Welsh Language Commissioner and the Irish Language Commissioner in particular. This, in turn, will inform how the legitimacy of the regulator may be reinforced, so as to secure the effective implementation of public policy while at the same time reinforcing the confidence and trust of both the bodies subject to regulation and also of citizens. In setting the office of Language Commissioner in context, that is in Ireland, Wales, the UK and internationally, the work draws upon a rich variety of source material arising from fieldwork conducted in a number of jurisdictions. The methodological approach that underpins the research comprises, in the first place, an authoritative review of the relevant research literature in the fields of language planning and policy, public administration, language law and linguistic rights, regulators and regulatory regimes, and, political science. The work is therefore multi-disciplinary in approach, engaging with the scholarly and professional literature in language policy and planning, socio-legal studies and the politics of language.
The research data underpinning this work includes a rich vein of material arising from fieldwork conducted in Canada, Ireland and Wales. This comprised a set of fieldnotes taken at a range of public events pertinent to the research questions along with a series of semi-structured interviews conducted with dozens of key actors from the pertinent legislatures, governments, regulatory offices, interest groups and civic society representatives in the various jurisdictions. This body of interviewees included ombudsmen, commissioners, regulators, politicians, civil servants, policy advisors, activists, and academic experts. The interviews were transcribed and analysed through using the computer-assisted qualitative data software programme NVivo 10 and its associated tools. In order to make full use of the particular architecture of the programme the data derived from the fieldwork was organised in a series of text-based and audio files and a deductive coding structure created from the research issues and questions at the core of the project as a whole was applied to them using an iterative approach. This coding structure was the foundation of the node and framework matrices through which the data was analysed. The coding exercises included the creation of hierarchical structures of nodes, grouping the codes into code families as co-occurring nodes, as well as creating inductive codes and auto-coding. The data was also explored though matrix coding, key-word and key-phrase text search queries; through creating word-clusters, trees and frequencies in context as well as through generating connection maps based upon group queries. The output of this work was a series of semantic networks and that enabled the capture of the key themes arising from these particular data, along with the relationships between them. Any material from the fieldwork interviews has been wholly anonymized.
The pertinent contemporary and archived professional, technical and grey literature in a number of languages in Wales, as well as Canada, Ireland and elsewhere, provided an alternative source of invaluable data. The linguistic coverage of source material for the purposes of this research includes, in particular, English, French, German, Irish, Spanish and Welsh. This literature included a substantial body of almost 100 governmental documents arising from a number of Freedom of Information applications in various jurisdictions. In addition to this literature, close attention was paid to the public discourse on the Commissioner and the language issues associated with the office in the broadcast and print news media. The careful analysis of this material has given rise to a number of important insights.
During the course of the project Mac Giolla Chr&amp;iacute;ost wrote a series of detailed internal discussion papers and briefing on a range of key themes, and directed the development and writing of others by Carlin, and these have formed the basis of a several conference and research seminar presentations and other expert academic discussions under the Chatham House Rule leading to the development of two research monographs (under consideration with publishers). Mac Giolla Chr&amp;iacute;ost, together with Carlin, consulted with certain experts based elsewhere in the UK and internationally, both professional and academic, in order to clarify, in an authoritative manner, some very particular aspects of the research. The robustness of the research results along with the interpretation of them has been triangulated with regards to the following 'types': data, investigator, theory and methodology.
The research findings from Wales are organized into a set of thematic concerns comprised as follows: independence, accountability and organizational form or structure; language rights and freedom; regulatory standards; promotion and complaint-handling; the Crown, Ministers of the Crown and Crown bodies; Welsh as an official language; and, the complexity of the Welsh language regulatory regime. The research results offer a range of insights to the scope and function of the office of the Commissioner of value to developing a better understanding of various important aspects of the scholarly field of language policy and planning. Some of the work will also be of substantial interest to academics working in the areas of administrative justice and of language law, domains united by the unfolding debate on the idea of linguistic justice. It is likely that some of the results will be of especial interest to policy-makers and practitioners as well as opinion-formers engaged in language issues. 
A number of the research results from Wales have immediate relevance to public policy and, indeed, may appear to be rather striking to Welsh policy actors. These include, for example, the following conclusions:
I. the current organizational form, or corporate structure of the office of the Commissioner is not fit for purpose;
II. there are insufficient checks and balances on the operation of the office of the Commissioner;
III. Ministerial direction is appropriately framed in the Measure and has been appropriately applied;
IV. the current mechanics with regard setting the Commissioner's budget are appropriate;
V. there is a conflict of interest between the First Minister and the Welsh Language Tribunal;
VI. the legislative cycle in particular was informed by weak and partial evidence on a number of issues but in particular on the following matters: statutory declarations of official language status, freedom to use a language, the concept of 'active offer', and the independence and accountability of the office of Language Commissioner generally;
VII. distinctions between expert and activist evidence were often substantially blurred;
VIII. Common Law jurisdictions can, and indeed do, accommodate official languages;
IX. that the English language is declared an official language under the National Assembly for Wales (Official Languages) Act 2012 is certainly of doubtful vires as the Assembly has no legal competency with regard to English;
X. Welsh Language Standards, as per the Measure, can be said to create language rights;
XI. Welsh Language Standards are no less complex than are Welsh Language Schemes;
XII. that both the Commissioner and the Welsh Government are responsible for promoting the Welsh language creates duplication;
XIII. it is constitutionally unsound for the Commissioner, as a regulator, to be under a duty to critique Welsh Government policy;
XIV. the operation of complaint-handling function by the Commissioner is a marked improvement upon the historical performance of the Welsh Language Board;
XV. there are clear signs of regulatory activism by the Commissioner and also indications of regulatory capture of the Commissioner by language interest groups. This is manifest in the Commissioner campaigning for changes to Welsh Government legislation and in the manipulation of the complaint-handling process by the Commissioner in relation to specific cases regarding the freedom to use Welsh and the Welsh language services of high street banks;
XVI. the Commissioner mis-represented the legal implications of the result of Judicial Review she initiated against National Savings and Investments;
XVII. the relationship of the Crown, Ministers of the Crown and Crown bodies to the Welsh language regulatory regime is overly complex and ambiguous;
XVIII. there is no single model of commissioners in Wales with which the Commissioner can, or ought to, conform.
Overall, therefore, the evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is good reason to substantially revise aspects of the Welsh language regulatory regime in its totality, including via legislation. 
With regards the Irish Language Commissioner, the research results are organized into a set of thematic issues as follows: the separation of powers; personality and structure of incorporation; rights, schemes and standards; equality and the official status of Irish; the Gaeltacht; Irish as an official language; and a reflection upon the long drawn-out review of the Official Languages Act 2003. The research results offer a range of insights to the scope and function of the office of the Commissioner of value to developing a better understanding of various important aspects of the scholarly field of language policy and planning. 
A number of the research results have immediate relevance to public policy. This includes, in the first place, the conclusion that the Commissioner is a regulator and therefore a key actor in facilitating the effective implementation of public policy under the Official Languages Act 2003 [henceforth 'the Act']. One of the implications of the office being a regulator is that it sits in the Executive branch of government. Regulators are understood to be a part of the family of the Government of the day and are, therefore, as the research literature shows, independent within the State but not independent of it. The evidence shows that the precise nature of the most appropriate form for the independence of the Commissioner in relation to the Government is widely misconceived, including under the Act. Indeed, leaving the Act itself to one side, the research shows that the policy document governing the relationship between the Commissioner and the Government very much appears not to be fit for purpose. The Commissioner, in line with other regulators, must be autonomous in the daily operation of the functions of the office but he also ought to be subject to appropriate guidance and direction on the part of the Minister, while avoiding inappropriate political interference. He ought also to be more directly accountable to the Minister, as well as to the Legislature (the Houses of the Oireachtas) along with the Minister. Being a regulator, it is clear from the research that there are insufficient checks and balances on the daily operation of the office. For example, the work of the Commissioner is not informed by the views of an Advisory Panel. Moreover, and contrary to the current manner of the incorporation of the office of the Commissioner, the evidence demonstrates that the norm for the corporate structure of regulatory offices is the corporation aggregate. Corporations sole, as with the office of the Commissioner, are shown by the research literature to be very dependent upon the personality of the incumbent. Regulatory risk is much better managed by corporations aggregate. The circumstances leading to the resignation of the first holder of the office of the Commissioner can be understood in these terms. There is, therefore, a strong case for re-modelling the corporate structure of the office.
The policy and legislative cycles leading up to the Act and also the Government's recent review of the Act made very limited use of expert, as opposed to activist, evidence. Indeed, distinctions between expert and activist evidence were often substantially blurred. As a result, deliberations at both these stages were informed by weak and partial evidence on a number of important issues. These include the following: international comparators for the office of the Commissioner, the separation of powers, the functional identity of the office of the Commissioner, the nature of the ombudsman role, the nature of the regulatory role, the strengths and weaknesses of Language Schemes, the relationship between duties and rights, and the legal and policy implications of the notion of equality.
During the course of the development of the Irish language regulatory regime there was a very poorly developed understanding of the notion of equality as applied to language. There was a dramatic shift during the legislative cycle with regard to how the notion of equality informed the Act. Pressure by interest groups, based upon the Constitutional status of the language, was significant in driving this shift. However, the research shows that the act of resiling from equality has had implications for the language beyond the Constitution, one of which has been to reinforce tokenism. Related to this is the manner in which rights are framed by the Act and, to some degree, interpreted by the Commissioner. The research shows that the Act realizes certain rights for Irish-speakers via the duties laid out as regulatory standards in Schemes. But, the research also shows that the Act circumscribes the rights of Irish-speakers in some important regards and that important elements to them have been deputed to the Commissioner alone. The vindication of rights and the ability to seek recourse to legal remedy are somewhat limited, although the research illustrates that the Commissioner is a very effective complaint-handling office.
The research found evidence to show that there was considerable institutional resistance to aspects of the Act as it was being developed and, it would appear, that much of that resistance remains. In particular, while the public rhetoric of the Government which was the architect of the Act claimed that it would create rights for Irish-speakers to conduct their business with the State in the national language other non-public official material shows otherwise. In short, the research demonstrates that the State was determined that only a 'quantum' of its services would be available through Irish. This disjuncture between Ministerial rhetoric and regulatory reality is also manifest in the regulatory style inherent to the Act and, therefore, the office of the Commissioner. Unlike more fully robust regulatory regimes there is no 'pyramid of enforcement' in the Irish context. Simply, the research shows that Irish language regulatory regime has limited traction; it has little bite. In addition, the research suggests that this resistance, along with the retreat from equality, has been felt most deeply in the Gaeltacht. Set in the broader context of the ongoing shift from Irish to English in the Gaeltacht, and drawing upon other authoritative research on that shift, this work shows how the failure to pay sufficient attention to the Gaeltacht as a feature of the Irish language regulatory regime is contributing to the language shift there towards English.
The research findings from Canada are organized into a set of thematic concerns as follows:-accountability and organizational form or structure; language rights and freedom; promotion and complaint-handling; comparisons and variance between the Federal and Provincial models of Language Commissioners; the Court Challenges Programme.
The Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages (OCOL) ensures compliance with the Official Languages Act, which was adopted in 1969 (revised in 1988) and which created OCOL. The role of the COL is set out in Part IX, sections 48 to 75 of the OLA The mission of OCOL is to promote English and French and protect the language rights of Canadians and it aims to support the development of the country's English and French speaking communities. The work of the Commissioner of Official Languages is varied and far reaching, it is designed to:-
i. &amp;quot;Increase awareness of language rights and the importance of bilingualism;
ii. Provide outreach to official language minority communities and to the public;
iii. Handle complaints and respond to requests for information on official languages;
iv. Conduct investigations to ensure that federal institutions comply with the Official Languages Act;
v. Intervene before the courts;
vi. Conduct research on official languages;
vii. Table a report every year to Parliament on our activities and on the state of official languages in Canada.&amp;quot; (Source: OCOL 2015, see www.official languages.gc.ca)

Amongst the research results are the following specific insights:-
i. The Trudeau vision of Canada's language regime is waning.
ii. The Commissioner of Official Language (COL) is defined as the active conscience of the Official Languages Act.
iii. Alongside other Agents of Parliament, the COL is independent from the Federal Government and sees itself as the guardian of core Canadian values.
iv. It has recently co-operated more fully with other Agents and is now co-located within the same government complex as Elections Canada and the Privacy and Information Commissioner, offering synergies and cost-effective back office services.
v. Since 2006 the Commissioner of Official Language's role has been less about interpreting the mandate and more about developing leadership to secure linguistic duality.
vi. OCOL performs both an Ombudsman and a promotional role in making the duties and rights of Canadian Language legislation better known both to the citizen and to public bodies.
vii. Advancing OCOL depends on how the business of government is changing. OCOL has had to adapt its remit in the light of successive governments' change in emphasis of the value of bilingualism as revealed in revised versions of the Roadmap for Canada's Official Languages.
viii. Given the recalcitrance of some senior managers in government departments the ability of OCOL to impose significant fines to secure enforcement is a live issue.
ix. The Court Challenges Program of Canada, established in 1978 to provide funding for official minority language cases based on sections 93 and 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, was cancelled in September 2006 and is now reconfigured as the Language Rights Support Program (LRSP) administered by the University of Ottawa. The program is funded by a multi-year contribution of $1.5m from Canadian Heritage and provides a useful mechanism by which the current socio-legal issues surrounding official languages may be refracted.

Of these, the following have the following implications for practice. As a consequence both of improvements in IT and Federal government policy many Federal bilingual services are now delivered on-line and while fully co-equal in terms of the quality of the 'Language of Service mandate', there is less of a bilingual footprint and a corresponding downgrading of several offices where there is a reduced human capacity to perform key functions in French. This has implications for OCOL in terms of regulating adherence to Part 1V of the Official Languages Act and in promoting the vitality of Official Minority Language Communities (OMLCs). Thus by illustration, the Canada Revenue Agency no longer has physical offices and this trend is being followed by other federal agencies which reduces both the presence of the Federal Government and employment opportunities for French speakers, especially in less populated areas where previously government directed employment growth served to bolster the linguistic landscape of remote communities. Thus while the service offered adheres to the requirements of the OLA the vitality of OMLCs is reduced somewhat.
The Commissioner has consistently argued that Senior Managers in Government Departments need to be pro-active in creating a workplace that is conducive to the use of English and French. Nationwide some 40% of positions in the federal public service require knowledge of both official languages. Between 2009-2015 the Commissioner has advocated working more closely with Ministers to strengthen the language skills of applicants seeking a career in the public sector. The Federal Government in the spring of 2015 announced that it would make it mandatory for prospective candidates to acquire appropriate language skills prior to being appointed. It argued that the University system should increase its provision of bilingual education, especially for those entering the public sector. It further argued that it had previously invested heavily in seeking to 'apprentice' public servants to the required standard, but so often this standard had not been met and as a consequence the working use of French in particular had suffered. Cynics have argued that this is essentially a cost-cutting exercise and as a consequence the degree of bilingualism in the public sector will be reduced.
Despite the continued commitment of the Federal Government to promoting linguistic duality as enshrined in the Roadmap for Canada's Official Languages, 2008-2013, renewed for 2013-2018 with the same budget, there are still countless indications that federal institutions see linguistic duality as a burden rather than a value. Actively offering service in the official language is not simply a matter of obligation, it is defined as a matter of respect both for individuals and communities. The OCOL has consistently sought ways to increase this sense of ownership of the other official Language, even if the citizen does not speak it. This is one of the prime challenges through which the COL seeks to develop his leadership role in persuading Canadians of the value of linguistic duality.
The Roadmap for Canada's Official Languages 2008-2013 expended $1.1 billion over five years supporting the vitality of official language communities and promoting English and French as second languages. Fourteen federal institutions implement the current and previous Roadmap with a prime emphasis on health, economy, immigration, education and justice. The successive Roadmaps offer both an insight into language policy and into the broader question of what value the government places on language as a marker of a political community. The successive Roadmaps have witnessed a shift in the government's thinking from one that emphasises a human rights based framework to one which emphasises the economic added value of language. Thus the 2013 plan specifically insists on measuring the impact of the money expended on the development of Official Language Minority Communities (OMLCs). The implication is that there will be more scrutiny on the role of OMLC and their contribution to the Canadian economy and OCOL has to adapt its strategy and working methods to reinterpret its mandate within this new language regime. The research literature suggests that a reduced emphasis on holistic language planning and a greater emphasis on economic development within OMLCs means that language is being increasingly operationalised as an area of government intervention rather than being seen as integral to Canadian identity. 
The overall conclusion is that having been conceived in the late sixties and revised in the eighties the OLA and OCOL have proved remarkably adaptive to the demands of the present day. The internal processes of OCOL especially in relation to complaint handling and investigations are robust and effective. What is not so clear is how OCOL will respond to the three challenges of the impact of IT on the methods of delivering bilingual services, the increased utilitarian, commercial and economic emphasis which the Harper Conservative Government (up to October 19th 2015 when it was replaced by a Liberal Government under Trudeau) has placed on the role of Official Languages and the ongoing demographic and demo linguistic transformation of the Canadian population occasioned by large-scale immigration. More broadly speaking again, offices of language commissioner in Canada at federal, provincial and territorial levels might be said to work reasonably well with regards the following:-
I. entrenched constitutional rights afforded to the linguistic minority
II. statutory mechanisms (ombudsman and court remedy) to ensure the language rights of citizens are respected
III. education in the other official language
IV. the maturation of the Office of French Language Service Commissioner which in 2014 gained independence. Thus rather than being accountable to the Minister responsible for Francophone Affairs it answers directly to the Ontario Legislature which guarantees protection and independence for the FLS (as is the case for other Commissioners in Ontario).

However, other features continue to pose a challenge for the language regime and its system, thus the:

V. language of service has improved in all regions but there is room for further improvement;
VI. for language of work, progress is uneven within Federal institutions; the research literature demonstrates the asymmetry in the use of the two official languages in and by government and the predominance of English in many regions that are designated as bilingual for language-of-work purposes;
VII. there continues to be much room for improvement at the provincial, territorial and municipal levels especially in relation to both 'protective bilingualism' and 'participative bilingualism' and this requires sustained evidence on influencing behavioural change and an increased awareness of the need to demonstrate productive outcomes in favour of French language skills and use;
VIII. the continued high level of immigration, over 1 million every four years, has prompted OCOL to call for a greater effort to encourage both the migrants and the children of migrants to learn French and to thereby feel more Canadian as the two official languages play a central role in identity.
IX. in several communities this continued demographic pressure also threatens the stability of the minimum threshold criteria of 5 percent of the population whereby it may be served in French. The parameters of 'significant demand and 'where numbers warrant' which trigger Federal bilingual services raise problems. Even a minority community with a growing population can fall below the 5 percent threshold if the majority population grows faster.
X. In consequence OCOL is in the process of commissioning a series of studies to inform their future policy development on community vitality; second language acquisition; the French language outside Quebec; the language training needs for the public service. 

Canada's experience in reconciling two cultures that once fought each other is useful in other parts of the world. 
I. OCOL is very much involved in post-conflict reconstruction, especially in Sri Lanka.
II. Canada has served as a model for language policies in other countries, including Kosovo, Iraq and India.
III. Canada has been the driving force behind the International Association of Language Commissioners, providing leadership and institutional support for the expansion of the Association.
IV. Language policies must be based on respect and have clear mechanisms to ensure that rights of citizens are respected. The Federal and Provincial Language Commissioner's complaints system and investigatory practice provide such mechanisms and guarantees.
Aspects of the various findings have been disseminated through various means and some have been made available online. For example:

http://golwg360.cymru/newyddion/cymru/195689-iaith-angen-corff-o-bobol-nid-comisiynydd-unigol</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Those who have demonstrated a keen interest in our research include the Federal and Provincial Language Commissioners in Canada, the Office of Language Commissioner in Ireland and Wales, the International Association of Language Commissioners and selected government agencies in the case study contexts. In addition academic specialists in the fields of comparative law, public policy and administration, sociolinguistics and language planning have engaged with the research team and have collaborated on related projects.

Research has already had impact in three distinct areas, namely:-
1. First the creation of the International Association of Language Commissioners which brings together all the current language commissioners and those with equivalent standing in various jurisdictions to discuss common issues, share best practice and advise on post-conflict resolution in various contexts.
All three team researchers were present at the 2013 Dublin conference which formulated the remit and membership criteria of the IALC. Prof Colin Williams acted as Rapporteur and co-organiser of the conference together with Sean &amp;Oacute; Cuirre&amp;aacute;in, An Coimisin&amp;eacute;ir Teanga and Peader &amp;Oacute; Flaharta, FIONTAR, DCU.
http://cosmopolitique.org/2013/05/25/international-conference-on-language-rights-dublin-may-24-2013/. 
Co-organiser and participant at the Inaugural Conference of the International Association of Language Commissioner, Barcelona, March 21, 2014. Prof Colin Williams gave a plenary presentation and was asked to be the Research Advisor of the IALC and contribute to the development of successive annual conferences.
http://languagecommissioners.org/documents/PROGRAMME_DELEGATES_INTERNATIONAL_FINAL.pdf

Co-organiser and Rapporteur of the Second Annual Conference of the International Association of Language Commissioners, Ottawa, May 19-21, 2015. Prof Colin Williams acted as rapporteur for the conference and has prepared a Report which is currently being considered by the officers of the IALC. http://languagecommissioners.org/documents/Program_EN.pdf
Currently involved in the programme planning for the next international conference which is to be hosted by the Welsh Language Commissioner in Cardiff, Spring 2017.

2. The second area of impact is the production of specialist briefing papers for Government departments which has informed their thinking and actions e.g. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Review of the Official Languages Act 2003, April 2014; specifically p.5; p.7 on 'Language Schemes' and 'The Gaeltacht'; pp.9-10 on 'Language Schemes.'
Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2014, as per governmental briefing paper; specifically Head 7, Amendment to Section 14 of Principal Act and Head 8, Amendment to Section 15 of Principal Act.
3. The third area of impact is in relation to civil society and academic discourse. The research has informed the community-based / interest group discourse e.g. 'Comisinydd y Cydwybod' by Hynek Janou?ek in Y Tafod Mai 2015 pp.14-15, together with the academic discourse - thus subsequent to team members 'contribution at Cardiff 2014 and presentation at Aberystwyth 2015, the proposed 'Welsh model' of commissioners (Williams &amp;amp; Sherlock, Aberystwyth) no longer includes the Welsh Language Commissioner. See - the Shooter report; also, Williams &amp;amp; Sherlock @ http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/media/departmental/interpol/iwp/Commissioners-and-OmbudsmenSeminar-Briefing.pdf cf Williams &amp;amp; Sherlock @ http://adminjustice2015.bangor.ac.uk/programme.php.en
