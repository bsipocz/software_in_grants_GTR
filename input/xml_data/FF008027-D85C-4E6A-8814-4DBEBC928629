Such an ability is absolutely essential for an animal's day-to-day life, and is achieved by coordinated activities of nerve cells (neurons) in the spinal cord. Although it is known that the ability to flexibly control movement speed is gradually gained during development, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to reveal how spinal neurons develop the ability to provide variable electrical signals to regulate muscle contraction so that flexible movements can occur.
 
The animal we plan to use for this study is the tadpole of Xenopus laevis, the African clawed toad. The organization of Xenopus neurons in the spinal cord that control swimming is much simpler compared to that of mammals. At the time of hatching from their eggs, Xenopus embryos generate simple swimming activity; within 24 hours after hatching, Xenopus larvae are then able to generate more flexible swimming patterns with varying frequency and intensity. This behavioural transition provides an ideal model to reveal how spinal neurons develop to direct this flexibility. We hypothesize that this flexibility can be achieved by developmental changes of neuron properties and their connections within the spinal cord. To test our hypothesis, we will monitor individual spinal neurons and motor nerve activities simultaneously using Xenopus embryos and larvae. We plan to test how spinal neuron properties develop, how their interactions change, and how variable swimming speed can be generated.
 
Understanding how spinal neurons control movement in simple animals, like Xenopus tadpole, will help us to understand more complex systems, such as movement control in humans. This study will also shed light on revealing how other nerve cells controlling different rhythmic activities, e.g. breathing, function.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The ability to flexibly control movement speed, like running and swimming is fundamental for animals to survive everyday lives. The movement speed is determined by the frequency and strength of muscle contraction, which in vertebrates is controlled by spinal central pattern generator (CPG) networks that generate flexible rhythmic motor output. The ability to flexibly control movement speed is gradually gained during development, but how it is achieved is poorly understood.
 
Using a simple model system, the spinal neural circuit of Xenopus laevis tadpoles, we aim to address how CPG networks develop the ability to flexibly control movement speed. Over a 24 hour period, Xenopus motor circuits develop from the embryonic network (stage 37/38) that generates simple swimming with gradually decreasing frequency and intensity to the larval CPG (stage 42) that provides more flexible swimming with varying frequency and intensity. This behavioural transition provides a good model to reveal how flexible motor output can be generated by spinal CPG. We hypothesize that this flexibility can be achieved by the developmental changes in electrical properties and synaptic interactions of CPG neurons. To test our hypothesis, the activities of individual CPG neurons will be recorded simultaneously with ventral root activities in immobilized embryos and larvae. By linking cellular activities to network outputs, we plan to reveal how motoneuron electrical properties develop from embryo to larva; how synaptic inputs alter motoneuron firing pattern; how larval CPG neurons generate swimming activity with varying frequency and strength.

This project, focusing on the neural mechanisms underlying enhanced locomotor flexibility at early developmental stages, will assist studies in more complex systems, has the potential to reveal common principles of how motor circuits function, and sheds light on how other neural networks with rhythmic output function.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of this project is to reveal how motor control circuits gain the ability to control movement speed during development. The data generated will have impact on beneficiaries that have been detailed, including the scientific community studying locomotor control and other neuronal networks, university students, general public, health care and 3Rs.
 
This study will provide unique data of movement speed control that link cellular property to network activity, and these data are scarce at present and difficult to obtain from mammalian systems; therefore researchers working on locomotor control and other neuronal networks will gain from this study in designing their research and deciphering the results.

A postdoctoral research assistant will be trained in specific techniques, data analysis and deciphering, as well as scientific thinking, which will prepare him/her for developing his/her future scientific career and joining scientific community. Especially the training of electrophysiological skills is important as these techniques are essential for neuroscience research, and researchers with such skills are inadequate. The research assistant will also gain experience of presenting data orally in seminars and conferences, writing papers for publication in peer-reviewed journals, and working in the Centre for Neuroregeneration with many top level neuroscientists. At least 2 MSc students from the MSc in Integrative Neuroscience will be trained in electrophysiological approaches and data analysis, and learn new advances in locomotor research field. This project will also be introduced to undergraduate Neuroscience Honours students and postgraduate students. They will be involved in data analysis and discussions to help them establish scientific thinking in addition to the specific technical skills taught.

Locomotion research is an important part of neuroscience which interests a large proportion of the public. This work will benefit the general public with respect to understanding locomotor control. Tadpoles (and frogs) are one of the familiar animals to the general public and therefore provide a valuable entry point for the general public to understand how scientific research is carried out, and how motor circuit controls behaviour. Knowing the development and operation of locomotor control systems is a prerequisite for better understanding and clinical treatment of movement disorders like Parkinson's disease and spinal injury restoration.
 
This project will also benefit 3Rs. As this project utilizes a simple vertebrate to uncover common mechanisms of locomotor control, it reduces the use of mammalian animals and yields fundamental data to facilitate generating computer model systems for helping reduce animal use in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>401663</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Society for Neuroscience annual meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B0CB651-F20A-4625-A89A-A368AD17E442</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tens of thousands people attended this annual meeting.
