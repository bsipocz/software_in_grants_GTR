The aims of the organisation are: 
- To broaden audiences engaging with the arts and sciences in Macclesfield (KPIs: total MBF audience numbers; audiences identified with growth potential: i) young people, ii) young/family audiences, iii) visitors from outside SK10/SK11 iv) low-income residents
- To increase participation in the arts and sciences (KPI: total number of volunteers, participants, groups, performers, experts &amp;amp; artists involved in MBF)
- To improve the quality and depth of experience of the arts and sciences in Macclesfield (KPIs: perceived quality of events/exhibitions/overall festival; legacy [attitudes, assets, spin-offs]; number of visitors who experience new activity/knowledge
- To showcase and support local talent and skills (KPIs: proportion of local performers, experts &amp;amp; artists and new/original productions/events)
- To increase the town's cultural activities and impact thereof (KPIs: no of cultural happenings in Macclesfield; media coverage; reach)

The overall impact of this project will be to inspire and engage the Barnaby2016 festival audience in science and astronomy using a 'space' theme. 

The aims of the Barnaby2016 'Space' Sciences strand are: 

- To actively engage audiences of all ages in Macclesfield, particularly 10-18yr olds, children in areas of lower socio economic achievement, and the more arts-focused festival audience 
- to inspire and engaging them with activities and opportunities to participate
- to highlight aspects of frontier research at facilities such as Jodrell Bank
- to break down barriers between the arts and sciences by interpreting the theme 'space' side by side 
- to build on existing and create new partnerships with scientists, engineers and educators, locally and nationally 

We will do this by a major step change in public engagement and offer a more extensive, educative science and technology strand at Barnaby2016. Using the theme 'space' we will capitalising on the proximity to Jodrell Bank and the scientific &amp;amp; pharmaceutical industry professionals locally to encourage Maxonians to explore, enjoy and engage with both the arts and the sciences. 

We have already been successful in winning grant funding from the Arts Council England to interpret the theme of 'space' through a programme of visual arts commissions (we are in discussion with Jodrell Bank and University of Manchester about an artist in residence) and a participatory performing arts commission (La Lune, an interactive, whole town, narrative event over eight days of the festival about an astronomer's adventure). This application would deliver a scientific strand to complement and enhance our existing programme and create a holistic interpretation of 'space' across the arts and sciences. 

Barnaby2016 can support delivery of the following STFC aims: 

-To capitalise on the inspirational value of these subject areas for many national audiences, including the general public, schools, young people and other groups 
-To encourage STFC-funded scientists to wider audiences and to discuss issues with non-specialists 
-To encourage partnerships, such as those between scientists and educators, industry and professional communicators.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Hi Impact Consultancy, science and technology educators are working with Barnaby to develop their hands on public engagement activities usually delivered in schools, for use in other community and festival environments. They are offering their time free of charge to explore and test activities. Their assessment of the what worked and didn't work will be included in the Barnaby festival evaluation. 

The overall Barnaby Festival will include a section specifically on the STFC space science strand. This will be distributed among our partners on this festival (Daresbury, Hi Impact, MaccAstro, Macc College, SciBar etc) and made available on the websites www.barnabyfestival.org.uk for use by other festivals. 

We liaise in a loose network of festivals locally through the CVS Festivals Network and the Association of Festival Organisers. This includes Macclesfield based Wild Rumpus who organise the award winning, outdoor family arts Just So Festival and routinely include some science activities at their weekends in the woods. We will share the experience of bringing a more substantial science strand to an arts event with these networks. 

Barnaby will feedback to primary and secondary schools in the area about successful ideas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/N00213X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
