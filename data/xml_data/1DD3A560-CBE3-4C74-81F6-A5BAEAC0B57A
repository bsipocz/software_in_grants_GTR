In Britain, recent policy interventions such as Help to Buy have reignited debate about the growing difficulties faced by young adults seeking to become homeowners. Declining rates of young adult homeownership are frequently seen as a social problem preventing people from achieving security, freedom and community roots (Wallace, 2010). Homeownership is also promoted as a way to accumulate wealth, thereby enhancing prosperity and enabling society to finance pensions and care as the population ages.

While there is a consensus that young adults are increasingly delaying homeownership because of declining affordability, credit constraints and insecure jobs (Andrew, 2012), the impact of family structures and ties remains more uncertain. Demographic changes such as increased solo living, rising rates of lone parenthood and more complex partnership biographies are all likely to have consequences for young adults' housing careers. Concerns have also been voiced that house price inflation means that family wealth is rapidly becoming a prerequisite for first-time homeownership, potentially impeding social mobility. As a result, this project seeks to re-examine how family trajectories and resources influence young adults' housing careers, focusing particularly on homeownership transitions. By analysing how family trajectories, economic forces and the housing system interact to affect young adults' access to homeownership, this research will provide evidence about social fluidity in contemporary Britain.

To fulfil the objective I will conduct two linked strands of research. Strand 1 will describe and explain changes in the long-term tenure pathways of young adults. This strand will address two questions:
1. To what extent are homeownership rates across young adulthood lower for more recent birth cohorts?
2. How are young adults' transitions into homeownership linked to family trajectories?
These will be answered by using descriptive techniques and multilevel models to analyse data from the ONS Longitudinal Study (1971-2011).

The second strand will focus on understanding the timing and effects of young adults' homeownership transitions. Answers will be sought to three questions:
3. To what extent are young adults increasingly delaying first-time homeownership?
4. How do partnership biographies affect the timing of young adults' entry into homeownership?
5. Does entering homeownership in young adulthood confer subjective benefits?
These questions will be answered by using event history and fixed effects models to analyse data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2008) and Understanding Society (2009+). To interrogate how political-economic contexts configure homeownership transitions, I will also conduct similar analyses using comparable panel data from other countries (with guidance from international collaborators).

This project will contribute to knowledge by theorising the neglected links between contextual forces, family trajectories and housing careers. By analysing how access to homeownership configures social mobility, the project will also extend our understanding of social stratification. These contributions will be delivered through journal articles, academic presentations and hosting a small conference (2017).

The project aims to also have impacts outside academia. By establishing a User Forum, hosting two workshops (2016 and 2017) and producing briefing papers, the study will inform policymakers (eg. the Department for Communities and Local Government) and extend the housing research streams of third sector organisations (eg. the Joseph Rowntree Foundation). Through online dissemination and public outreach activities, my work will be positioned to contribute to public debate about the role of homeownership in British society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the aftermath of the economic crisis, housing policy has risen up the British political agenda and become the focus of public debate (Jones, 2013). Much attention has been directed towards the difficulties of accessing homeownership and how this could have long-term consequences for economic vitality and the equitable distribution of resources (Willetts, 2011). This project is therefore well placed to benefit non-academic actors. By following my Pathways to Impact, my research will benefit multiple non-academic actors in a range of ways over the duration of the project and into the longer-term.

(1) National policymakers
Current Westminster policy promotes homeownership, for instance through Help to Buy and the renewal of Right to Buy (DCLG, 2011; HM Treasury, 2013). Thorough analysis of the factors causing young adults to delay homeownership will therefore help policymakers to (a) devise interventions to assist homeownership transitions or help people to live fulfilling lives in other tenures. This is becoming an increasing concern amongst voters (PricedOut, 2013). Analysing young adults' transitions to homeownership in other countries will (b) help policy formulation by providing comparative evidence on the impacts of economic, welfare and housing systems. 

Analysing how tenure trajectories have changed over time will also (c) help policymakers to decide whether establishing a 'homeownership society' is a realistic goal (Clark, 2013). By (d) exploring intergenerational continuities in homeownership, my study will provide evidence of the necessity of 'joined-up' policymaking on social mobility. This could inform the policymaking process.

(2) Think tanks/NGOs
Given that housing is many households' largest asset and expenditure, it is unsurprising that think tanks and NGOs are concerned about access to homeownership. The New Economics Foundation (NEF), Smith Institute and Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) are all conducting or commissioning work on homeownership. My project will inform these organisations by providing robust evidence on how housing pathways are changing over time. This will help them to (a) formulate their lobbying strategies to influence policy and create a fairer society while (b) focusing their research agendas. 

(3) Housing charities
Greater awareness of changing tenure pathways and access to homeownership will benefit resource-limited charities such as Shelter. Shelter are deeply concerned about a growing 'housing affordability crisis' and will therefore benefit from analyses of how housing prices, costs and policy interventions have reshaped homeownership transitions. This information could help them to (a) lobby policymakers to increase support for young adults and (b) help them to target their support services to provide relevant advice to people seeking to attain homeownership.

(4) The public
There is currently huge public interest in housing issues, fuelled by media debates about 'Generation Rent' and campaigns for affordable housing (PricedOut, 2013). Wide dissemination of my research on changing housing pathways will (a) inform the public about the realities of accessing homeownership in contemporary Britain. Comparing changing housing pathways across different Western countries will also (b) raise awareness of alternative forms of welfare and housing provision. Taken together, these impacts will (c) help the public hold policymakers to account.

(5) Property developers/housing associations
By highlighting the barriers preventing young adults from entering homeownership, my research could (a) benefit property developers by helping them to identify households requiring tailored support to enter and sustain homeownership. This information may also (b) be of value to housing associations and non-profit landlords, enabling them to make informed investment decisions based upon an appreciation of latent demand.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>215979</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project website, blog and briefing papers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BCB0D217-52CC-40EF-8CD6-905FE45BD813</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A project website, blog and RSS feed were set up by R Coulter in late 2014 to stimulate public interest in the research topic. The website is maintained by S Bayrakdar and has two principal aims:

1. The website hosts all relevant project resources and outputs, including accessible policy briefing papers and a blog.
2. A dedicated Twitter and RSS feed linked to the website help to raise public awareness of the research topic and promote informed debates about families and housing.

Project news and developments are further publicised through the Department of Sociology's social media channels.

In September 2016 I was also invited to write an accessible blog post summarising my work on young adults' homeownership for the Urban Studies journal blog: http://urbanstudiesjnl.blogspot.co.uk/2016_09_01_archive.html.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b3655c671675.20078151</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ftht.sociology.cam.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>User Forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8805E805-4743-4F58-82CE-735AF189FD7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussed research project at annual intervals with a non-academic User Forum comprising active participants from the Department for Communities and Local Government (Scott Dennison, Deputy Director and Head of Strategic Analysis), local government (Jane Kennedy, Research Business Manager, London Borough of Newham) and Shelter (Rachael Emmett, Research Officer). Research project findings were also discussed and disseminated through ad hoc Centre for Science and Policy meetings to policymakers and housing practitioners such as Tom Tolfree (Senior Government Economist with the Department for Communities and Local Government) and Roger Wilshaw (Research Director, Places for People).

These meetings (a) stimulated increased interest in project research and (b) shaped the direction of the project. Short tailored briefing papers summarising key findings were also circulated to forum members for discussion and dissemination across their professional networks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b36890e30c73.53709973</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>GSS/GESR conference 2015 (London, 18/09/15)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C96782E8-A2C1-43F6-B78B-AA96FC6BD8DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented work on how family background shapes young adults' homeownership in England and Wales to 40-50 civil servants from across government departments at the Government Social Research/Government Economic Service 2015 annual conference.
