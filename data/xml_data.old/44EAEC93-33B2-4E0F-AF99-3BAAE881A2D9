For example, nanoparticles of semiconductors have highly definable colours and hence are useful for security inks, while atoms of radionucleotides, used for tracer analysis in medicine can be held within bucky balls and kept separate from body chemistry. On the mechanical front, carbon nanotubes, which are not much larger in size than polymer molecules, show exceptionally axial strength and stiffness, the strength of an individual nanotube being at least ~10 times higher than that of any known fibre. The challenge is to make the nanotubes consistently and then to build them into fibres so that some of their brilliant mechanical properties can be translated into useful engineering materials. A process to make carbon nanotube fibres in a single operation has recently been demonstrated by the Cambridge team. The potential of the process (announced in Science ) for making high performance fibres has led to considerable interest worldwide, both from the existing fibre industry, for whom it represents a disruptive technology, and from fibre users. However, the 'technology pull' is such that our insight into the process at a basic level needs to catch up. We need to be able to produce nanotubes of predetermined dimensions as the first stage towards a fibre product with highly consistent properties. The reason for the exceptional properties seen is not fully understood, nor is the relation between process parameters and the resultant structure. A deeper understanding is also necessary as a basis for scale-up strategies, which will be critical in estimating the likely industrial cost of the product, and thus the future risk. The fibres made so far promise strengths and stiffnesses which will at least rival current carbon and aramid fibre products, while the energy absorption on fracture is several times that of these materials, commending the material for the burgeoning markets in body armour and vehicle 'hardening'. However, the intrinsic, one-step simplicity of the process indicates that the product should be very much cheaper than any equivalent currently available. Indeed, the process might be viewed as a highly refined version of that used to make carbon black, a commodity which sells for about 1/50th of the cost of carbon fibre. If this new cheaper fibre is successful in composites, it could bring down the cost of transport vehicles, enabling F1 structural technology to reach the family car. The first stage of the project will be to build a fully instrumented production rig, to learn more about the nanotube growth and the origin of defects which are a source of inconsistency in measured properties. Key experiments will be undertaken to determine the best approach to scale-up, in particular a second reactor will be built to evaluate to miniaturise the process as a scale-up strategy. There is so much yet to be understood. Kilometre lengths of fibre will be produced so that the applications can be externally assessed. Carbon nanoparticles provide opportunities for medicine: drug delivery and cancer treatment being two examples. However, the enthusiasm of pharmacologists and oncologists is balanced by cautionary notes from toxicologists. The properties which make nanoparticles unique lead to effects in vivo which may either be beneficial or detrimental. In the case of nanotubes, the latest toxicological studies indicate that they are no more toxic than particles from (say) a laser printer, however, it is recognised that the human body may have difficulty in eliminating nanotubes in the long term. From the business angle, any nanoparticle scare, whether well founded or not, may hold development back and at worst put investment at risk. As we take this work forward the materials researchers at Cambridge will work closely with toxicologists at Napier University and the IOM.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197115</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The industrial application of Multi-Walled Carbon Nano Tubes is extensive; therefore this research into their potential inflammatory nature is useful in policy guidance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DFD4EE52-985B-4A35-B6A5-9D1E7E468796</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461e17f8b86f5.59699362</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Nanotechnology involves the development and use of materials and objects at the nanoscale (1-100nm). In nature, such objects are much smaller than individual cells, in fact they are around the same size as the proteins and DNA molecules that you find in cells. Nanomaterials are being developed because substances change their properties when they are made in such small dimensions. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are examples of a fibre-like nanomaterials that are being made in relatively high quantities. CNT are essentially made from tubes of graphene, with either a single layer or multliple layers (multi-walled carbon nanotubes; MWCNT) of graphene stacked inside each other. They are extremely strong and conduct electricity, making them useful in many products. With any new technology it is important to assess the potential risks, as addressed in this study. In order to assess risk this study investigated both the toxicity of CNT and the potential for exposure to CNT during manufacture in a laboratory environment.

CNT and toxic fibres (e.g. asbestos) exhibit similar physical properties such as their fibre shape, durability as well as their metal content, which are all key in driving toxicity. Long, biopersistent fibres are not cleared from the body by immune cells known as macrophages, and therefore persist, causing inflammation which leads to tissue damage and disease. Higher iron content of such fibres can also increase toxicity as they trigger mechanisms that also cause cellular damage. While, in respect to CNT, an increased crystal structure may enhance durability, or conversely, a high level of amorphous carbon may also trigger mechanisms inducing cellular damage. It is therefore important to test whether these hypotheses stand for CNT in order to inform safe methods for production, handling and disposal. 

The toxicology study employed 5 MWCNT varying in length, iron content and crystallinity. Four of the particles generated were straight fibre-like MWCNT, including 2 short samples and 2 long samples. Short was defined as a length easily taken up into immune cells allowing clearance from the lungs. Long was defined as a length preventing effective cellular uptake and therefore defective clearance leading to biopersistence. These samples also varied in their iron content and crystal structure, with each length including a high and low iron content sample, and a pristine or improved crystal structure. The fifth sample was provided by an industrial source. 

The CNT were assessed for their impact on immune cells (macrophages) responsible for clearing inhaled particles from the lungs. Measurements of viability (cell death), pro-inflammatory protein production, and particle uptake (phagocytosis) were all assessed. 

The toxicology data generated suggests that MWCNT are relatively toxic to macrophages in vitro, and that they can activate these cells to result in a pro-inflammatory response, and the generation of mediators that lead to tissue damage and disease. In addition, the MWCNT were not easily cleared by the macrophages, which would result in increased biopersistence. These effects were more marked for longer MWCNT and, at times, for those with a higher iron content and increased crystallinity, suggesting that not all CNT are equal in their toxicity and that CNT conform to the characteristics known to drive toxic fibre related diseases. Given that the production facility studied was aiming to make long CNT which would contain iron it was therefore necessary to examine exposure and control any exposure identified.



In conclusion, the toxicology study demonstrated the potential toxicity of the long MWCNT, demonstrating the need to identify and control exposure during manufacture and handling of the nanofibre product.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A new facility at Cambridge University was proposed as part of this study for the production of a continuous fibre made from MWCNT. The study therefore included an estimate of any potential risks to workers during the manufacture process.

The exposure assessment investigated exposure to respirable CNT during operation of the production process developed at Cambridge University and during handling of the material from that process under laboratory conditions. The effect of different Health and Safety interventions on exposure levels was also investigated. The active area of work was investigated as well as attaching personal air sampling devices to the people working in the environment. Three sampling surveys were conducted. The first survey identified respirable CNT within the immediate production area and so changes were made to the production facility included improved containment of contaminant by introducing a 'grey area' for containing any items used in the process and for removal of personal protective equipment along with improved exhaust ventilation. Following the second survey infrastructural changes allowed for a re-direction of potentially contaminated air flows away from operators within the production area. CNT material was found on some of the area and personal air samples collected during the first two surveys. These appeared in different forms, either as single fibres, as a fine web coating most of the filter surface, and/or as agglomerates of varying diameters. Following the final control intervention no CNT materials were detected on any of the filter samples collected demonstrating that production facility and procedure design can be effectively used to minimise exposure.

Exposure assessments initially identified respirable MWCNT within the working environment, but this exposure was effectively managed through the introduction of a dedicated area for handling items used during the production process as well as removal of personal protective equipment, coupled with infrastructural changes including re-direction of contaminated air flow.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D12E416E-43DF-414D-B37B-30433BEFB446</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-820561825.1306587750192a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>74A9431D-3DF0-433F-AA8C-21808E95B06D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multi-walled carbon nanotube induced frustrated phagocytosis, cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory conditions in macrophages are length dependent and greater than that of asbestos.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/da29a4723f0b7c5221680957f882f10a"><gtr:id>da29a4723f0b7c5221680957f882f10a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Boyles MS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0887-2333</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e6cd21021</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E04204X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>195B48B4-2BC5-4DEB-BA1A-323A90D8730D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tissue engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
