How do they get the feeling of how to move the hand, how much force to apply, and when? We know that surgeons gain these skills through years of training and experience. However, we do not have a complete understanding of &amp;quot;what is learned&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what underlying mechanisms are developed&amp;quot; to guide manipulation of the hand or how to quantify these issues. This suggests some specific questions we need to address: what are the task-specific tactile/visual/sequential conditions that trigger specific hand-arm movements? How is hand-impedance controlled for these movements?
Training for conventional MIS with a co-manipulated robot (robotic training) and assistance for conventional MIS with a collaborative robot (robotic assistance) can significantly benefit surgeons as in both cases the natural haptic feedback to the surgeon is preserved. To this end, we need to understand how the hand and arm are used during conventional MIS. Hand-impedance and arm-muscle activity measurements are required to develop the quantitative knowledge of skilled manipulation. This knowledge can be used to build a framework that links arm muscle activation to hand-impedance control for fine force and position contact at the hand. Such a framework could offer insights in training level of surgeons and help support the lack of skilled personnel. In my global research agenda, which extends beyond this project, I aim to (i) identify skilled and unskilled type movements by monitoring the tool movement, (ii) measure the hand-impedance in complex movements with an interactive robot, (iii) measure arm muscle activity with electromyography (EMG) and find out muscle activation patterns of skilled manipulation, (iv) develop a robotic trainer with such knowledge, (v) develop a robotic assistant with impedance compensation using this knowledge. This project, which constitutes the backbone of my research agenda, covers the items (i), (ii), and partially (iv):
My goal in this project is to identify the MIS skills based on tool-position tracking, to perform hand-impedance measurements during the complex hand-manipulations, to develop a co-manipulated robotic trainer for MIS where the subject gets real-time feedback and assessment through tool movement tracking and hand-impedance measurements. 
We will study three basic procedures in laparoscopic MIS: suturing, knot-tying, and bimanual carrying. The experimental setup will build upon my previous work - impedance measurements with an admittance controlled interactive robot - as well as my current work - on EMG based MIS skill identification and development of a mechanical adaptor to interface a MIS training platform to a robot. For the full research that directly relates to this project (items i, ii, iv), we need to understand on one hand, the skilled type tool manipulation and the corresponding hand-impedance levels (topic of this project), and on the other hand, the muscle activation patterns that generate these effects (topic of an accompanying PhD study). I will be contributing the accompanying PhD student to the proposed research, who is not funded by this project. The results of the work of this PhD student will be used in the funded project.
The robotic trainer will detect unskilled type movements and provide real-time feedback to notice those. The trainer will also assess the skill level of the subject by performing hand-impedance measurements besides evaluating tool movements. We will use a robot arm by attaching a MIS handle to its end-effector and an improved control/impedance measurement scheme that extends beyond my previous work. Subjects (professional-surgeons and novices) will perform MIS procedures with the tool attached to the end effector of the robot arm. The robot arm will passively follow and monitor the surgeon-hand movements and intervene from time to time for impedance measurements by introducing disturbances.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Robotic assistance is studied by many groups, but robotic assistant for professional skill requiring tasks is a rather novel domain, which has the potential to shift the direction of robotic assistant studies. This is because, (i) the starting point of such study is understanding the tacit manipulation skills in order to answer what is actually needed to be assisted, and (ii) the study targets to develop novel robotic assistance methodologies, which are potentially difficult to devise without closely examining the human behaviours. This project and its results will have impacts on robotics research community, MIS training centres, industrial applications that require fine manipulation, and the general public view of robotics, through the following pathways.
1. Robotics Research Community - will learn about new methods of robotics assistance with human factors in the centre
We expect to have four top level journal publications out of this project, with the corresponding topics of &amp;quot;identification of skills through tool movement in MIS operations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hand-impedance measurement for complicated hand movements&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;robotic assistance with hand-impedance compensation in MIS&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;robotic training for hand movements in MIS&amp;quot;, in top robotics journals. We will organize a workshop in one of the top robotics conferences with the topic of &amp;quot;skill training and assistance in minimally invasive surgery&amp;quot;. We, as the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics, are organizing the EU Robotics Forum 2017 in Edinburgh and the PI is serving as the Finance Chair of the organizing committee. We will propose a session in one of the workshops in this Forum during the course of this project.
2. MIS training Centres - will be introduced to robotic training technology and will have more effective training systems
We envisage that this project will make a step change in the methods of MIS training. The robotic training methods will spread to other MIS skills training centres throughout UK. For that purpose, we will communicate our results and achievements to the other centres through the channels of medical community (e.g. Association of Laparoscopic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, Royal College of Surgeons of England).
3. Industrial Applications - will benefit from robotic training-assistance technologies adaptable to various applications
This project will enable application of robotic assistance and training to a variety of actual industrial manipulation tasks. An examplary robotic training technology will be proposed to be developed in collaboration with welding training institutions in the UK. With dedicated visits to these institutions we will demonstrate the existent (and yet elementary) robotic training system for welding and the advanced training system applied to the MIS operations. The system will also be introduced to industrial audience through industry-oriented conferences (e.g. EU Robotics Forum) and publications.
4. General Public - will appreciate that collaborative-robots can enable people to do things better and that robots can be a companion for doing and learning things
The progress and results of this project will be proposed to be presented in public science events. It is remarkable that Edinburgh International Science Festival recently hosted two workshops devoted to &amp;quot;The Rights of The Machine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Unbottling the AI Demon&amp;quot;, both of which revealed the public interest as well as cautiousness about robots taking part in daily life. The main cause of such cautiousness is that people think that the ever-developing robots are replacing human workers and creating an isolated automated sphere that humans do not have much understanding and impact. This project has the potential to challenge such fears as the robotic systems we develop are not to replace humans but to help them, and they do not function standalone but only in collaboration with humans.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100776</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P013872/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
