It will combine research into the objectives, tactics, ideologies and assumptions of Gaelic language movements in Scotland from the late 19th century to the present with an analysis of the changing policy responses from government and public bodies. The principal emphasis of the study will be on the period from c. 1975 to the present and the so-called 'Gaelic Renaissance', which has been marked by an upsurge in campaigning and promotional activity and increased provision for the language in the fields of education, broadcasting, culture and government. \n\nModern Gaelic language movements may be said to have begun in 1891 with the founding of An Comunn G&amp;agrave;idhealach. An Comunn was a product of the specific ideological and cultural context of that fin de si&amp;egrave;cle period, which saw the emergence of similar movements to promote 'minorised' languages elsewhere, most obviously Ireland and Wales. From the early decades of the 20th century on, proactive efforts were made to relocate Gaelic to modern political and cultural contexts. These initiatives were the province of a cultural elite, however, and appear to have had little resonance with the mainstream of the Gaelic community, which was preoccupied with structural socio-economic difficulties that were manifested by ongoing outmigration from Gaelic communities, which continued until the 1960s. At the same time, other strands of language maintenance efforts, beginning in the 1940s and coming to fruition after 1965 with the establishment of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, were more closely connected to strategies to promote regional economic development.\n\nFrom the 1960s on, Gaelic language activists began to place increasing emphasis on the connection between Gaelic, Scotland and Scottishness, and Gaelic has been increasingly understood and depicted as a national language in Scotla, indeed as the original Scottish language. Although the link between Gaelic and Scottish national identity remains faint and contested when compared to the dynamic seen in Wales, there is clearly some connection between the recent 'Gaelic Renaissance', the general reinvigoration of Scottish culture, and the increased political success of the Scottish National Party. To date, however, the dynamics of these relationships are very substantially unexplored.\n \nA related, and equally unresearched, issue is that of agency: who was driving Gaelic language movements, what were their motivations and ideologies, and why did certain kinds of activity come to the fore at particular times? These issues arise in the early movements from 1891 on, but are particularly important in connection with the initiatives of the last few decades. Some tentative explanations point to the changes in educational provision and opportunity from the mid-1960s, which helped create a cadre of well-educated, aspirational and confident Gaels who were keen to secure and promote their language, not only in 'heartland' rural areas but also in Lowland towns and cities. \n\nIn terms of methods, this project will involve a combination of documentary research and interview-based fieldwork. Documentary research will involve study of newspapers, magazines and other printed sources from 1891 onwards, especially those produced by Gaelic organisations (in both Gaelic and English), and of 'official' documents from the Scottish Office/Executive/Government and other public agencies, including local authorities and the BBC. Interviews with activists, organisational staff and civil servants will focus on the dynamics of political campaigning and changes to policy and provision from the 1960s onwards. \n\nThe result of the project will be a wide-ranging and ground-breaking study that will add significantly to our understanding of the dynamics and causation of Gaelic revitalisation activity over the last century.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The current project focuses on the increasing prominence of Gaelic in Scottish public life, analysing the policy and identity dynamics that have brought about this transformation. As such, it is axiomatic that there will be significant public interest in Scotland in the outcomes of this project, ranging from public bodies and agencies of various kinds (including local government, education institutions and the arts/culture sector), to Gaelic organisations and media, to other groups and individuals concerned either with Scottish culture as a whole or with minority or multicultural organisations of different kinds within Scotland. The project can therefore make a significant contribution to enhanced public understanding of the changing role of Gaelic in Scottish life and have a meaningful impact on policy formation and on broader public awareness. These processes are particularly relevant in terms of the the implementation of the Gaelic Language Act of 2005.\n\nIn relation to issues of Gaelic language development and policy, I have significant and long-standing experience of engagement with a range of groups in Scotland beyond the academic sector, including Gaelic development organisations, Gaelic community groups and Gaelic media. Over the course of the last fifteen years I have served on a number of different committees and working groups organised by Comunn na G&amp;agrave;idhlig, B&amp;ograve;rd na G&amp;agrave;idhlig and BBC Scotland and have given a number of addresses and presentations of different kinds to non-academic audiences. I have spoken to Gaelic community groups in several parts of Scotland, including Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness, and I have also addressed groups concerned with the development of the Scots language and with British Sign Language. In terms of media engagement, I appear regularly on Gaelic news and current affairs programmes on both radio and television, dealing with a wide range of topics, principally relating to issues of language policy and with knowledge tranr more generally. At the University of Edinburgh, I have organised annual seminar series on language policy and planning since 2001-2 and these events have had a strong appeal to the local Gaelic community and to officers in governmental and non-governmental organisations.\n\nTo disseminate my research, I plan to make presentations to the Gaelic Societies of Glasgow and of Inverness, two prominent Gaelic cultural organisations, in relation to my investigation into the Gaelic language movements of the first half of the twentieth century. I would hope to publish a version of this presentation in the Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness or in Scottish Gaelic Studies, an important, peer-reviewed journal in this field in which I have published several articles in the past. I will present a seminar in Edinburgh concerning recent Gaelic policy development and then plan to submit an article to the journal Scottish Affairs, which is the principal journal dealing with Scottish public policy and which has a diverse readership in the public, media and business sectors, above and beyond academia. I have published four articles in this journal in the past on Gaelic-related topics.\n\nThe impact of this research will also reach beyond Scotland, particularly in relation to the current implementation of language legislation and policy. In this regard, I have given joint presentations concerning the drafting and implementation of language legislation in Ireland and Wales with Irish and Welsh colleagues, and in February 2010 I will be giving a presentation on these issues to the Indigenous, Minority and Lesser-Used Languages Working Group of the British-Irish Council in relation to issues arising from language legislation. I plan to present findings from the current research in fora of this kind. I will also be submitting an article concerning recent policy development to th</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture for City of Edinburgh Council (Lauriston Castle)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0151C5F2-4E77-40A8-BCE4-622DC7AD92D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was a wide-ranging discussion, focusing mostly on historical aspects of the presentation.
