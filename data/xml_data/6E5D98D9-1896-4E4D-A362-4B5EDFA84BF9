Suppose a database is stored on one or more remote servers. A user wishes to retrieve a piece of information from the database, but does not wish the servers to know which piece is being retrieved. PIR schemes allow this goal to be achieved.

Classically, the aim of a good PIR scheme is to reduce the amount of communication between the user and each server. More recently, a breakthrough paper of Fazeli, Vardy and Yaakobi has shown that techniques from coding theory can be used to reduce the amount of storage needed by the servers, without increasing the communication complexity to impractical levels: each server need not store the whole database. This aspect will become increasingly important as the size of remotely stored databases increases.

The proposal aims to study the ramifications of this breakthrough result: to construct better PIR schemes; to understand the limitations of the new techniques; to apply these techniques to related areas. This forms a part of a long-running project by the Principal Investigator to apply techniques from combinatorics, coding theory and algebra to problems in cryptography. The proposal includes an 8-month visit of Prof. Tuvi Etzion (Technion) to the UK, and a one-day meeting in the summer of 2016 to raise the academic profile of this rapidly developing area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short term, the impact of the research in this proposal is to the academic community. In the medium-term, the techniques (for enhancing privacy and reducing the need for storage) generated by this project will underpin real-world applications; their importance can only increase as the use of remote storage and of large databases becomes more prevalent. The efficient and secure use of distributed databases will contribute to the full spectrum of the Research Councils' definition of impact, including UK economic competitiveness (particularly in the digital economy), the effective delivery of public services (where large remotely-accessed databases are already used) and by enhancing quality of life by enabling new distributed applications. As well as the direct influence of the research itself, the project will enhance the community's awareness of the area's techniques and problems (via a one-day meeting, and associated collaborations). This background will benefit industry by training consulting academics, and researchers who move into associated industries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59958</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant has led to the discovery of several new families of PIR array codes, which are a key building block in the construction of protocols for users to retrieve information privately and efficiently from a database stored across several remote servers. Two papers have been produced describing these constructions and published on the arXiv: &amp;quot;PIR array codes with optimal PIR rate&amp;quot; by Blackburn and Etzion, and &amp;quot;PIR schemes with small download complexity and low storage requirements&amp;quot; by Blackburn, Etzion and Paterson. Versions of these papers are currently in submission for conferences and possible journal publication. The first paper defines the PIR rate, which measures how efficient a PIR code can be relative to the number of remote servers involved in the protocol. Schemes with good, often optimal, PIR rate are constructed and upper bounds on the possible PIR rate are proved. The second paper constructs schemes where the amount of data downloaded from servers is small, with the aim of reducing the total storage requirements across all servers. Various bounds are proved on the minimum download complexity of such schemes. 

One aim of the grant was to organise a meeting on the topic of Private Information Retrieval: the resulting meeting was very well attended and useful.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is underpinning work, designed to explore the possible data structures for storing a distributed database, and the possible protocols for delivering selected information privately to users. The work is near the start of a growing academic field, likely to expand significantly over the next few years. The work has already been taken forward as part of the academic literature in the area: as of end February 2017 Google Scholar lists 7 citations for the preprints produced under the grant. In the longer term, beneficiaries in industry will include any business that uses large remotely-stored distributed databases, particularly that part of industry that designs and runs remote servers that store these databases. The results of the grant have been submitted to high-profile conferences and journals that are read by both academia and industry, maximising the chances that the ideas generated will be taken up.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BF3D3598-1058-4661-9D15-E56CB0C1E7CF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b5419d241782.26795393</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ma.rhul.ac.uk/SRBpapers</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D4DD16A3-E6B6-4594-9DDA-64F0084BCCB1</gtr:id><gtr:title>PIR array codes with optimal PIR rates</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6bdaf1d90dad576f9ba82899187a1f75"><gtr:id>6bdaf1d90dad576f9ba82899187a1f75</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Blackburn S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9807fc529b15.33638827</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB1063F7-2F19-4BF5-82C3-8C8FF83EC49E</gtr:id><gtr:title>PIR schemes with small download complexity and low storage requirements</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6bdaf1d90dad576f9ba82899187a1f75"><gtr:id>6bdaf1d90dad576f9ba82899187a1f75</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Blackburn S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9808543cd647.19284177</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N022114/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
