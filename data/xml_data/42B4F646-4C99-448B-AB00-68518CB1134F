What was not anticipated at the time of planning that project - which centred on exhibiting the partbooks and telling their story - was that there would be considerable interest by performers, both singers and instrumentalists, in getting access to a broader selection of the music contained in the Wode partbooks in modern format and notation. Since much of this music is potentially performable by amateur and professional groups, the most significant obstacle to its inclusion in modern repertories remains the original notation and partbook format (one voice part per book rather than all voices printed together). Although some of the Psalter's music has been printed over the past fifty years, this has been sporadic and, almost exclusively, in scholarly collected editions such as vol. xv of the Musica Britannica series. While a modern edition was made of some of the music in preparation for the recording and concerts organised as part of the original project, this is not currently available to the singing and playing public, nor was it envisaged that it would be. 

The proposed follow-on project will seek to satisfy this demand by providing free access to a broad selection of the music contained in the Wode partbooks. The target audiences for this will include professional and amateur choirs (including church choirs), professional and amateur instrumental groups (in particular those regularly performing early music), school choirs and instrumental groups. Through the activities of these groups the music in the partbooks will further be made available to a much wider public including concert-goers, church congregations, school and higher-education level students. The partbooks contain a wealth of music of different types which was known and performed in Medieval and early modern Scotland. The project proposes to transcribe and edit for easy modern performance all of the metrical psalms, hymns and canticles arranged by Scottish composers, as well as motets, anthems and instrumental music by Scottish and continental composers copied by Thomas Wode. This music is an important part of Scotland's musical heritage, whose relative inaccessibility has caused its neglect. Well-researched entries for the Scottish composers involved will also be prepared for Wikipedia.

In order to maximise accessibility the project proposes to make the musical editions freely available through specific websites, rather than through a printed edition. Music is increasingly being made available through such websites and to do so for a repertory such as this represents an innovative and creative response to the challenges of marketing printed music. By using a website, rather than paper publication, the international scope of the project will also be enhanced. This will represent an innovative departure for early Scottish music and will allow it to reach a much wider audience than hitherto. Web-based plug-ins such as 'Scorch' will allow users to see and hear the music before printing it, as well as allowing performers to hear a playback of individual parts. The software will also allow transposition to fit the abilities of particular performing groups. 

A recording of a substantial selection of the music edited will be made by the specialist and highly-prized Scottish early music group, The Dunedin Consort, and made available both as a commercial CD and a download, in order to demonstrate the music and disseminate good practice in its performance. The bundling together of the modern music edition, the recording, and the digital images from the partbooks which will be available on the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music will provide a unique resource not hitherto available for this highly-important repertory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The follow-on project aims to impact on a very wide group of people in two phases: firstly amateur and professional singers and instrumentalists through the provision of easily-accessible performing editions; secondly to a wider audience of church-attenders, concert goers, listeners to recordings and downloads. By making the music available online and through a recording we expect a ripple effect which, over time, will extend on a worldwide scale. 

Amateur choral singing is practiced extensively, both in the UK and abroad, and is known to enhance the quality of life and health of those who enjoy it. It aids community identity and social networking. Performing and listening to music is an important part of the UK's leisure industry and contributes on many levels to the economy. The music of the 16th century, both sacred and secular, forms a significant part of the repertory of both amateur and professional choirs. Its uses range from the aesthetic--such as in worship services, concerts and recordings--to the pedagogical--as choral training. In particular, the music contained in the Wode Partbooks is an important part of Scotland's musical heritage and the follow-on project aims to increase the impact of this heritage in Scotland and internationally. There is continuing strong public interest in the history of the Reformation period in general, and in England in particular, as exemplified by the number of Television series and programmes set in that period. The contribution made by Scottish composers of the period is, however, largely ignored, as is the contribution of music to the Scottish Reformation. The proposed project will begin to address these lacunae through knowledge exchange, disseminating the research carried out during the parent project. Music is an important channel through which historical and cultural information can be communicated: this was much in evidence in the very positive reaction to the playing of music from the partbooks during the exhibition and to the musical excerpts on the iPhone app. which accompanied it. 

Church choirs form a significant subset of the choral scene and are continually on the look-out for appropriate repertory. While not limiting our targeting to such choirs, we recognise that much of the music in the Wode partbooks will be of interest to them. The partbooks can provide material for the needs of church choirs across the denominational spectrum, especially those in the Scottish reformed tradition, not just in Scotland but throughout the world. As well as being part of the Presbyterian heritage, the psalm-settings and anthems can also find a valuable place in contemporary worship. Through the knowledge exchange provided by this project the music of the past can be used to renew that of the present.

Using the worldwide web, through existing websites, will maximise the impact, both nationally and internationally. Workshops will be organised in a number of key UK centres, attracting local amateur and church choir directors and members, in order to publicise the resource. Advertisments placed in strategic publications, together with a number of presentations at appropriate conferences and meetings will do the same. University, Conservatoire and school music departments will be circulated with information, as well as church choirs. The recording, available as a commercial CD and as a download, will make a lasting impact and will encourage people worldwide to sing and play this repertoire.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95884</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Editions have been made of all of the sacred music from the Wode Psalter and have been uploaded onto the Church Service Society website where they are available for free download by singers, choirmasters and instrumentalists.

The object was to raise awareness of the editions and the recordings on the Church Service Society website, and of the music in the Wode Psalter generally, through direct participation in singing and using materials from the website. The workshop held in St. Mary's Haddington culminated in both a concert (see separate entry in the portfolio) and a Sunday Morning Service at which settings of the psalms and canticles, and the anthem, were taken from the Wode Psalter. The Minister explained the context to the congregation and some lively discussion ensued over coffee as to the relevance and potential use of the project materials in contemporary worship. There was a very positive feeling that they could be so used, not necessarily regularly, but certainly on occasion.

Feedback from the various workshop participants was generally very positive. Comments such as 'Thank you, it was a very informative and enjoyable weekend' were typical. The workshops were attended by church musicians and choir masters and this has led to the project materials being used in church services in Edinburgh and beyond. For example, the choir at St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Edinburgh (whose choirmaster had attended one of the workshops) recently devoted a church service to materials from the Wode Psalter Follow-on project, integrating them into the service, and this was reckoned to have been very successful.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464758fdc1bc1.86955753</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advertising the Wode Psalter editions and recordings in Choral and Organists' Journals</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>37B03326-F597-4DA0-A9FC-FCB83A47F9D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Advertisments were taken out in the following journals: Choral Journal (American Choral Directors Association), International Choral Bulletin (International Federation for Choral Music), Anacrusis (Association of Canadian Choral Communities), Sing Out (Australian National Choral Association), Choir &amp;amp; Organ (Independent).
