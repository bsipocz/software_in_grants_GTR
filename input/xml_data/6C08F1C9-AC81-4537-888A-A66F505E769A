FA is often diagnosed using skin prick test or by detecting IgE (allergy antibodies) in the blood. However, more common than being food allergic is to have a positive allergy test to that food. For example, only 1 out of 5 children with a positive allergy test to peanut in the United Kingdom has peanut allergy. In the equivocal cases (more than 50% of patients), an oral food challenge (OFC) is required. OFC consists in giving the patient the suspected food in a controlled environment to see whether the patient develops an allergic reaction. OFC are quite expensive, time-consuming and place the patient at risk of a potentially severe reaction, but this is currently the gold-standard for the diagnosis of FA. In my MRC-funded PhD project, I developed a new blood test called the basophil activation test (BAT) that works like an OFC in a test tube. BAT to peanut showed 97% accuracy in the diagnosis of peanut allergy and reduced the need for OFC by two thirds. In this project, I will develop similar diagnostic tests for cow's milk and egg allergies, which are the most common food allergies in childhood, and for sesame and cashew, which are two of the foods that most commonly require OFC as conventional allergy tests fail to diagnose allergy correctly. I anticipate that BAT will lead to a significant improvement of care for allergic patients and will reduce the costs and anxiety associated with OFC.
BAT requires the use of fresh blood cells. As part of an MRC Award, I developed a test similar to BAT using a cell line that is grown in the laboratory and thus is readily available. I will test various samples of peanut allergic and non allergic patients to validate this assay as a biomarker of peanut allergy. I have developed a similar assay to test the ability of antibodies in the blood of non allergic patients to block IgE - this is the inhibition of mast cell activation test (IMAT), that I will validate as a biomarker of food tolerance. These assays could be used in future studies to test samples collected far from the laboratory or to test in parallel samples that have been collected at different time points, in relation to allergy or tolerance.
To understand why some patients have a positive allergy test and are not allergic, I will determine which specific part of the allergen the antibodies of allergic patients and non allergic individuals recognise. It is possible that allergic and tolerant patients recognise different parts of the allergen that may or may not be able to trigger allergic symptoms, respectively. It is also possible that allergic and tolerant patients recognise the same parts of the allergen molecule but tolerant individuals generate antibodies of a different type that are able to block IgE. In collaboration with Professors Brian Sutton and Hannah Gould, artificial antibodies will be generated based on the antibodies of a peanut allergic patient and a crystal formed by these antibodies and by peanut allergens will help to investigate which part of the allergen is recognised by the IgE allergy antibodies. Mutant allergens will be generated by changing the allergen at specific sites. I will be testing these mutant allergens alongside with naturally occurring peanut allergens regarding their ability to cause allergic symptoms in the MAT. Blocking antibodies directed at the same part of the peanut allergens will be generated and its blocking activity tested on the IMAT. 
Understanding precisely what is happening when a patient is allergic and when a patient is not allergic despite the presence of IgE antibodies will help us to find ways to treat patients with FA and to prevent the development of FA by modifying the way the immune system responds to peanut or other food allergens.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The majority of children with food-specific IgE do not have food allergy (FA). In equivocal cases, oral food challenges (OFC) are required. However, these are expensive, time-consuming and not without risk. 
Aims:
1. To improve the diagnosis of food allergy using the basophil activation test (BAT)
2. To validate the mast cell activation test (MAT) and the inhibition of MAT (IMAT) as novel biomarkers of food allergy and food tolerance
3. To understand the mechanisms underpinning FA and tolerance in IgE-sensitised children
Methodology:
Following the success of BAT in accurately diagnosing peanut allergy (PA) and reducing the need for oral food challenges (OFC), I will create a new BAT to diagnose cow's milk, egg, sesame and cashew nut allergies. I will validate MAT and IMAT as biomarkers of PA and peanut tolerance, respectively. In order to understand the discrepancy between clinical allergy (and tolerance) and the levels of IgE (and IgG4) to peanut allergens, I will test the following hypotheses:
1.The location, number and combination of IgE epitopes in the allergen molecules play a role in the ability of allergen-IgE complexes to trigger effector cell activation;
2.Relative titres and matching of epitope-specific antibodies between IgE and IgG4 contribute to the overall effector cell activation or inhibition.
IgE and IgG4 binding to peanut allergen peptides will be performed. IgE and IgG4 epitopes will be identified on the allergen structure and compared between allergic and tolerant patients. The crystal structure of IgE-allergen complexes will allow identifying critical epitopes for IgE binding and their relevance will be assessed on MAT using wild-type and allergens mutated to remove specific epitopes. The blocking effect of IgG4 and Fab fragments with the same specificity as IgE will be tested in the IMAT.
Scientific and medical opportunities: This study will improve FA diagnosis and may identify targets for definitive treatment and prevention of FA.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research aims to improve the diagnosis of food allergy (FA) by using a very accurate newly developed blood test, to validate novel biomarkers of food allergy and tolerance and to improve our understanding of the mechanism that mediate food allergy and tolerance. The ultimate goals of this project are to create an accurate safe non-invasive diagnostic test for food allergy eliminating the need for oral food challenge (OFC) and to identify key targets for future interventions to treat and prevent allergic disease.
 
FA affects 8% of children and 2% of adults in Western countries. FA has become a significant public health concern; an increased prevalence resulted in an increased incidence in anaphylaxis, which can be fatal. There is no curative treatment for FA and the mainstay of management remains allergen avoidance and the use of rescue treatment for accidental reactions. FA affects the quality of life of allergic children and their families due to dietary and social restrictions and to anxiety related to the life-threatening nature of FA. 

The majority of patients with a positive allergy test are not allergic. In equivocal cases, which constitute about 50% of patients seen in an Allergy clinic, OFC are required to diagnose FA. However, OFC are laborious and expensive procedures that place the patient at risk of a potentially severe allergic reaction. In my previous research, the basophil activation test (BAT) proved to be very accurate (97%), with 98% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and was superior to other diagnostic tests in discriminating between peanut allergy and tolerance. BAT reduced the need for oral food challenges by two thirds. I now propose to expand the use of BAT to the diagnosis of other food allergies. 

The key beneficiaries from this research include: 
1. The immediate and wider science communities 
(see Academic Beneficiaries)
2. The health care system and society
I anticipate that the validation of a more accurate diagnostic test (BAT) for various foods allergies will substantially improve the care for patients with suspected FA, not only by improving the diagnostic accuracy but mainly by reducing the number of OFC required. The reduction in the number of OFC will have direct and indirect economic implications for the health care system: the costs of BAT are lower than those of OFC, BAT is less time-consuming and does not require a multidisciplinary highly-trained clinical team and eliminates the anxiety and risk associated with OFC. 
3. The food industry
Determination of thresholds is useful for the Public Health Authorities and for the Food Industry to establish regulatory measures to protect food allergic patients and to institute allergen control measures and labelling policies. However, this requires the performance of graded OFC in patients known to be allergic. In my previous work, BAT informed about threshold of allergic reactions to peanut. The same could be determined for other foods.
4. Patient organisations and patients 
(see Pathways to Impact)
5. Key established and new industry partners who can develop new paradigms for drug testing based on our mechanistic findings
My work will also open new potential research areas for exploitation. The discovery of new mechanisms underlying FA and tolerance will have significant potential to build on existing collaborations with industry and develop new industry collaborations. The same applies to the standardisation of BAT as a diagnostic tool in FA and making this test commercially available to multiple foods. All these possibilities will be of interest to industry especially for testing new therapies based on the immunological discovery of new targets. Furthermore, the close collaboration between clinicians and scientists fostered by my project will benefit both parties and create stronger links for further collaboration and translational activity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1483513</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EAACI Task Force on Allergen Thresholds</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CD094097-4E8C-4363-9D78-CEDF9F643DCE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c3ad628aed58.17106696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EAACI Allergen-specific Immunotherapy Guidelines for Food Allergy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E37CE1F7-4356-4014-B663-53D485D967EE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c3aced44f133.74873417</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EAACI Allergen-specific Immunotherapy Guidelines for Prevention of Allergic Disease</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>629B2624-EEBB-496F-AF28-9F6E994AC72F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c3ad1f8a6ff6.16464645</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EAACI Task Force on the impact of food processing on food allergy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>880A69D1-A2BB-4D41-9DFF-A47738AB2B5D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c3aded31ccb5.99467095</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The mast cell activation assay is a flow-cytomety based assay where mast cells from a cell line are sensitised with patients' plasma and stimulated with allergens or controls.
