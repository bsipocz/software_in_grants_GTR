However, this process occurs in a crowded environment since other equally important cellular functions must occur at the same time as DNA replication. As a result, genome duplication must occur even though the DNA is coated with many DNA binding proteins. Little is known of the effects of these DNA binding proteins upon replication even though there is much indirect evidence that such collisions lead to mutations in the DNA. We aim to use the replication machinery from a bacterium to analyse the effects of proteins bound to the DNA upon replication. We will measure the probability of DNA binding proteins halting the replication machinery, and will characterise the properties of protein-DNA complexes which lead to blockage of replication. However, cells clearly do have the ability to replicate their genomes even though the DNA is coated in a panoply of proteins. We will therefore search for enzymes that can help the replication machinery to move through DNA-protein complexes. These experiments will help us understand how all cells duplicate their genomes in a complex protein-rich environment. They may also cast light on how cells minimise the chances of their replication machinery stalling and causing potentially harmful mutations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Given the central role played by DNA replication in all forms of life, we know surprisingly little about this complex process. Most information has been gleaned from studies of replication in E. coli and its associated bacteriophages. However, these studies have centred largely on the mechanics of duplicating naked DNA templates in vitro. The situation in vivo is likely to be very different with a huge variety of proteins coating both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. These DNA-bound proteins range from those associated with genome packaging to more sequence-specific proteins such as transcription factors. However, little is known about how cells duplicate protein-encrusted DNA templates. Indirect evidence suggests that proteins bound ahead of the advancing replication machinery can present blocks to replication and, as a consequence, may be associated with potentially harmful genome rearrangements. We aim to use an in vitro DNA replication system developed using purified enzymes from E. coli to address directly the barriers presented by DNA binding proteins to the replication machinery. Preliminary data suggests that transcription factors bound to the template DNA lead to stalling of replication forks in vitro. We will characterise the probability of transcription factors bound to their cognate DNA sequences of stalling the replication machinery, and determine the biophysical requirements for replication blockage. These data will shed light on the probability of replication forks stalling at DNA-protein complexes found in vivo and will provide a first glimpse of the hurdles which all cells must face in duplicating their genetic material. However, cells do achieve genome duplication in a protein-rich environment. This implies that accessory enzymes are needed in vivo to help replication progression through protein-DNA complexes. We will attempt to identify these accessory factors using our in vitro assay system. We aim to detect enzyme activities which facilitate replication fork progression through protein-DNA roadblocks by screening both candidate purified enzymes and partially purified E. coli cell-free extracts. Identification of such factors will help understand how all cells overcome potential blocks to genome duplication. These proposed studies will provide insight into the biophysical barriers that replication forks must overcome in all organisms, and may also shed light on the molecular basis of the generation of replication fork pause sites and hotspots of recombination.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-02-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239317</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>14714</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Replication fork repair at the single molecule level.</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>42CC8826-46E2-4BD6-8614-BD4F78C2FC86</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5453773fb6ba34.26465105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A major reason DNA acquires mutations is that the machines that copy the DNA prior to a cell dividing break down frequently but why these copying machines break down is still unclear. This project utilised the experimentally tractable bacterium E. coli to investigate how these copying machines break down. The key findings from this project were:1) we established that proteins bound to the DNA can act as blocks to DNA copying machines. DNA in all organisms is coated with a wide variety of proteins that are essential for the utilisation and maintenance of DNA inside cells. Our work indicated therefore that proteins bound to the DNA may be a major, unavoidable source of problems for the DNA copying machinery.2) we identified two enzymes that can each promote copying of DNA that is coated with protein. These enzymes, named Rep and UvrD, are both a type of enzyme called a helicase. This type of enzyme moves along DNA and is able to displace proteins from the DNA along which the enzyme is moving. Our findings imply that either Rep or UvrD displace proteins from the DNA ahead of the copying machinery.3) we determined that E. coli cells require either Rep or UvrD for survival. Therefore cells require at least one of these enzymes to help DNA copying machines to move along protein-coated DNA.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project demonstrated for the first time how an organism replicates DNA that is bound by proteins efficiently. We have shown that in the absence of mechanisms that aid copying of protein-bound DNA, the replication machinery breaks down frequently and requires some form of repair to complete copying of the genome. Evidence is accumulating that all organisms face problems when trying to replicate their DNA because of the many proteins bound to it. Our work will inform our understanding of how DNA replication can be corrupted inside all organisms and will provide the basis for dissecting such processes in humans.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E6474AF-E106-4D43-9FC2-E4D8654652F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7955600403.207913779d9f7e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3208F4FE-7951-4341-A129-DA4A1D6F8869</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stimulation of UvrD helicase by UvrAB.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079"><gtr:id>374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Atkinson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>12859A25D80</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF9721C9-C091-48E3-9165-F7316F4C3CB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rep provides a second motor at the replisome to promote duplication of protein-bound DNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e105456caed9c6ebf4a413021e7607a6"><gtr:id>e105456caed9c6ebf4a413021e7607a6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guy CP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1097-2765</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>4A95B3EE675</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0330854A-980F-413D-928E-2093E963B5D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Linking transcription with DNA repair, damage tolerance, and genome duplication.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d3522eb1f11d774c9a36b59d7972dd92"><gtr:id>d3522eb1f11d774c9a36b59d7972dd92</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGlynn P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54525413c927c5.15946923</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F0FCEE7E-B202-48CA-852D-1E6AC78D0F6E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Replication fork reversal and the maintenance of genome stability.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079"><gtr:id>374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Atkinson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>FA9F50BEB9E</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C108DBF1-EF0A-41F7-AE6E-3C558B0EC592</gtr:id><gtr:title>The unstructured C-terminal extension of UvrD interacts with UvrB, but is dispensable for nucleotide excision repair.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>DNA repair</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/292d658fac3815667fa69403b208ac82"><gtr:id>292d658fac3815667fa69403b208ac82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manelyte L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1568-7856</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>0F29B61AB4E</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/C008316/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
