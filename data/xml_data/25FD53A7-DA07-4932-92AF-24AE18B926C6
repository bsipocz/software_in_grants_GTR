Some tendons are more likely to be injured than others, e.g. the human Achilles is highly prone to injury. This is partly due to its function. While most tendons are involved in limb placement for movement, some, including the Achilles have another function; they act as a spring, stretching to store energy then recoiling to return it, decreasing the body's energy consumption. To achieve this, they have a specialist structure. All tendons are composed of collagen molecules, grouped together to form larger subunits, the largest of which is the fascicle. Fascicles are bound together by inter-fascicular matrix (IFM), but we have evidence that this matrix has a unique and important mechanism in energy storing tendons and is responsible for allowing these tendons to act as springs. This has exciting implications; some individuals are able to use their tendons heavily without injury occurring whilst others are very prone to injury. We believe this may occur as a result of variations in the IFM, reducing the tendon capacity to extend and recoil. If we can quantify IFM structure and function and relate this to tendon properties, we may be able to predict the likelihood of injury in specific tendons, and develop methods to increase resistance to tendon injury and prevent disability.

Racehorses also suffer from tendon injuries. These are one of the most common reasons horses used for athletic purposes are retired and is a cause for considerable economic loss. The energy storing superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) in horses is functionally equivalent to the human Achilles and is injured the most often. The characteristics of tendon injury are similar between horses and humans, so we can use the horse as a model to better understand the role of the IFM in human tendon injury. In horse tendon, our previous work shows that the SDFT has a less stiff IFM than the non-energy storing common digital extensor tendon (CDET), which enables the SDFT to extend further before failure. We also have evidence that SDFT fascicles have a better recoil mechanism, indicating that lower IFM stiffness is critical for increasing damage resistance and protecting tendons from injury. Further, we have evidence that the IFM becomes stiffer with age, which may explain why tendon injuries increase in older people and animals. We intend to compare the structure and mechanics of the IFM in different tendons and different aged horses to see if we can identify the specific molecules that are key in influencing IFM mechanical properties. 

We will determine how the composition of the IFM influences its mechanical properties in both the SDFT and CDET. Firstly, we will look at the different proteins in the IFM, and establish how they are organised. We will then measure IFM stiffness and determine how this is influenced by different IFM components. Once we have identified structural differences in the IFM between tendon types, we will focus on the damage resistant SDFT for the rest of the project. We will perform several mechanical tests on the SDFT, which will allow us to establish which IFM components control the ability of the tendon to extend and recoil, and provide damage resistance. We will also identify any age related changes in IFM composition and structure, and link these with ageing changes in mechanical properties. 

In this work, we will focus on horse tendon. However, our findings will be applicable to humans and other species. The outcomes of this work will be the identification of components that are important in preventing tendon injury. The resulting data will allow us to understand the role of the IFM in normal tendon function, and how this changes with age and injury. This work will help researchers to develop treatments targeted at the IFM, and even improve training plans to promote appropriate IFM development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We have preliminary evidence that the interfascicular matrix (IFM) is a key determinant of tendon failure properties and fatigue resistance. We hypothesise that injury prone energy storing tendons have an extensible IFM with minimal hysteresis, leading to a structure with improved fatigue resistance. Poor optimisation of the IFM or structural changes with age may predispose individuals to tendinopathy.

This project aims to investigate the role of the IFM in modulating fatigue resistance. Using an equine model, we will compare IFM composition and mechanics between a high strain energy storing and a low strain positional tendon, correlating these data with the mechanical characteristics of the tendons. Looking specifically at the energy storing tendon, we will then establish how the IFM changes with ageing and how this influences fatigue resistance. Finally, we will use knockout models and enzymatic techniques to manipulate IFM composition, and establish how this influences our findings.

The equine model proves an ideal energy storing tendon, with similar properties to the human Achilles. It is also large enough to be used for a series of experiments, enabling paired statistical analyses of the influence of IFM organisation and age on tendon function. IFM composition will be assessed using histology, immunohistochemistry, mass spectroscopy and qPCR. IFM, fascicle and tendon mechanical properties will be determined using quasi-static and cyclic fatigue tests to failure. 

Data will provide greater understanding of how injury and ageing influence tendon mechanics via the IFM and may provide insights into methods of limiting injury risk. This will inform treatment practices, and facilitate the design of targeted drugs or treatments for the IFM. It may also be possible to develop training protocols to encourage appropriate IFM development, with the long term goals of decreasing the incidence of tendon injury and improving recovery rate post-injury.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Tendon disorders are highly debilitating and painful, and musculoskeletal injuries lead to more days off work than any other illness, costing the economy over &amp;pound;7 billion a year (1). Tendon injury is also common in horses (2) and with a total economic impact of over &amp;pound;3 billion a year from horse racing (3), preventing tendon injuries is high priority (4). A key outcome from our grant is improved understanding of tendon fatigue resistance which is fundamental to preventing damage. We anticipate considerable long term societal benefits to patients with tendon injuries, both preventing new cases and improving healing. This will improve quality of life, reduce strain on the NHS, and lower costs associated with time off work. Such findings are also directly relevant to horses. Around 16,000 race horses are in training each year (3), and tendon injury rate is as high as 43% with very few horses returning to racing post injury; preventing these injuries is essential for the economic health of the industry and to improve equine welfare (5). To realise these potential impact opportunities, we will target our research towards clinical colleagues and medical or healthcare companies.

This project will benefit academics and clinicians with an interest in tendon (dys)function. In the short term, our understanding of how tendons respond to load may clarify optimal methods for treating tendon injury. There is no current consensus on tendon treatment, and no clear physiotherapy regime to promote healing. The PI works closely with a clinical physiotherapist specialising in tendon disorders, and the pair have developed techniques for investigating in vivo tendon biomechanics. We anticipate using these systems to translate our in vitro findings to an in vivo setting and determine optimal physiotherapy training mechanisms for tendon repair. We also have a veterinary surgeon and academic within the current investigative team, enabling us to translate our research across veterinary boundies. Discussions with these healthcare partners will not only provide valuable feedback on the clinical relevance of our data, but also allow us to consider the optimal methods of disseminating our findings in a manner accessible to healthcare professionals.

Towards the end of the grant we will focus on R&amp;amp;D investment. In characterising the key matrix components that protect tendon from damage, this work will be of interest to companies keen to develop products to prevent or treat tendon injury. There is also strong potential for collaboration with biomaterials and tissue engineering companies. The composite structure of tendon appears key to its optimal function and fatigue resistance. Characterising this will enable us to identify the specific material requirements that must be recapitulated in artificial tendons, significantly improving our potential for developing functional repairs. With skills in biomaterials amongst the applicants, we would remain closely involved in the development of repair solutions. The team has experience of working with medical device companies focused on tissue implant products (e.g. Tissue Science Laboratories; now Coviden), enabling us to advance research towards biomaterial tendon repairs. We also predict tissue engineering benefits, specifically relating to the biological and mechanical environment surrounding cells in the non-collagenous tendon matrix. We anticipate that our data will highlight how cell environment differs in healthy and damaged tendon, providing insights into the optimal in vitro environment for promoting tendon repair. As an additional area of expertise within the research team, we would aim to develop links with tissue engineering companies to take this forward.

It has been pleasing to see press releases for a number of these papers taken up and reported across a range of literature such as 'Science Daily' and 'Horse and Hound' and the PDRA has recently been asked to give a lay talk to the Worshipful Company of Farriers on the data from this project. We have also kept out tendon website up to date, to further promote our findings to both a scientific and lay audience. 
Having presented the data at a number of conferences, it has been exciting to see a growing interest in the IFM throughout our community, and a number of tendon researchers seem to be building on our data and beginning to investigating the role of the IFM in tendon injury and tendinopathy. This provides the opportunity for real impact over the coming years, as we look for new treatments for tendon disease. The tendon research meeting we held in September 2015 provided an outstanding opportunity to bring together researchers from our field and promote our work on the IFM. The feedback from that event has been excellent, and we have made a number of industrial links as a result of the event.
We have received funding for three new projects springing directly from our findings and the dissemination of research data. The PDRA has been awarded a highly prestigious fellowship with Arthritis Research UK, which she will begin later this year, whilst the PI has been awarded a project grant by the Horse Race Betting Levy Board which focuses on clinical applications for our findings and engages industry in developing new tools for analysing and managing tendon injury. The CoI (Clegg) and PI (Screen) were awarded a Horserace Betting Levy Board grant in June 2015 to understand the mechanism through which the interfascicular matrix develops its specific functional properties from birth to 2 years of age (skeletal maturity) and Clegg has received funding from Orthopaedic Research UK and MRC relating to this work

IFM fatigue resistance important for function and possible tendinopathy location - new collaborations and funding to look at this more
2. New data concerning local mechanics of different tendon compartments - led to loads of new collaborations - modellers desperate for the data
3. Opened new questions of in vivo tendon mechanics - new collaborations and funding to look into this

Through the research funded on this grant, we have discovered several key findings which have opened up new research areas, outlined below.
Using a combination of mechanical testing and protein analysis techniques, we have answered important questions regarding structure function relationships within tendon. We have demonstrated that high fatigue resistance of the tendon interfascicular matrix (IFM) is important for tendon function, particularly in tendons that act as energy stores. This capacity for fatigue resistance is likely provided by 2 proteins, lubricin and elastin, which we have shown are highly localised to the IFM. 
We have further demonstrated that proteins within the IFM are renewed more rapidly than those in the fascicles, and additionally have shown that cyclic over loading of tendon explants causes damage predominantly within the IFM. Taken together, these data indicate that damage in response to overload may localise to the tendon IFM, potentially giving the IFM a protective role, in which it prevents damage propagation throughout the tendon by limiting it to an area which can more easily repair.
We have also answered important questions regarding the effect of ageing on tendon structure function relationships, demonstrating that, while the fatigue resistance of both fascicles and the IFM decreases with ageing, the IFM suffers greater age-related changes overall. The age-related reductions in IFM elasticity and fatigue resistance are accompanied by a reduction in the rate of protein renewal, and decreased elastin content and organisation. This likely results in a reduced ability to repair damage to this region and therefore contributes to the increased risk of injury with ageing. These findings open up new avenues to explore how age-related alterations in IFM may affect tendon response to loading and subsequent injury susceptibility, and grant applications to answer these questions are already underway.
In addition, the wealth of mechanical data characterising the response of tendon subunits to loading has generated several new collaborations with computational modellers across Europe, as these data are crucial to allow more accurate models of tendon behaviour to be developed. Our findings also raise important questions regarding in vivo tendon mechanics, and we have obtained further funding to develop ultrasound techniques that will allow us to fully characterise tendon mechanics in vivo. 
We have also assessed the contribution of specific proteins to IFM and fascicle mechanical properties. Samples in which proteoglycans have been disrupted by enzymatic digestion did not display any alterations in mechanical properties, suggesting that these proteins do not contribute significantly to the mechanics of either the IFM or fascicles. We have obtained internal funding for a PhD student who will perform similar studies to directly establish the role of elastin in IFM and fascicle mechanics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A greater understanding of how tendon responds to loading, how damage occurs, and how this is altered with ageing, will be of interest to medical and veterinary clinicians as these findings will help guide the development of treatments and preventative measures for tendon injury. Our findings will also be of benefit to researchers with an interest in soft tissue structure-function relationships. Indeed, as a result of this work, we are now collaborating with researchers from across Europe, for whom we are providing the data generated from our experiments to allow them to develop and validate their computational models of tendon mechanics. Further, our findings are also of importance to tissue engineering and biomaterials focused academics, as improved understanding of tissue function is key to developing appropriate artificial repairs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B22979DA-F3DC-4C25-8286-A7BA24D67332</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447bfc34c9ed1.12972554</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure
