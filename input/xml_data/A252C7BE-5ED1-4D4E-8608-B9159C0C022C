One of the simplest example is that of a spoon stirring a coffee cup to blend milk. Numerous applications can be found in the chemical and biochemical industries that utilise mixing of two or more phases or reactants.From this point of view several reactor designs can be distinguished that attain mixing in different ways: oscillatory flow mixers (OFM), static mixers, stirred vessels and shaking flasks. The last two types of reactors are rotationally induced mixing reactors for which a flow is generated by a stirring impeller or by the movement of the tray holding a cylindrical container along a circumferential orbit. The analogy between these two types of reactors is even more evident when considering that shaking flasks are often small scale mixers employed in the early stage of bioprocess development, before the developed process is implemented in a large scale industrial stirred tank.However, while the fluid mechanics of stirred tank reactors have been extensively studied, little is known about the flow patterns, flow transitions and instabilities taking place in shaken flasks. The consequences of this lack of knowledge are twofold: (a) a process developed in the shaken flasks cannot be fully characterised, undermining its reproducibility; (b) its operating conditions cannot be properly correlated to those present in industrial, scaled up reactors, usually stirred tanks, for which a vast amount of data is available in literature.Taking into account the differences in the flow geometry, certain types of instability and unsteadiness that are documented in the few papers dealing with fluid mechanics in shaken flasks, recall those that are encountered in a cylindrical container with a rotating endwall for which data is available in literature. The similarity between the two systems (i.e. shaking flask of cylindrical shape, and cylindrical container) is also indicated by the fact that the movement of the shaken flask can be seen as the superimposition of the rotating movement of a cylinder around its axis and a counter rotating orbital movement of the cylinder itself around an eccentric axis. The first type of movement is in fact very similar to that of a cylindrical container with a rotating endwall.Therefore the present research proposal has been formulated in three sets of experiments that will be carried in flows induced by three different types of rotational movements in a cylindrical container.On the one hand this methodology, with an analogy between three different flows investigated in the same geometry, should provide an original way to understand better the occurrences of flow instability and transitions from a general point of view, and will enable to assess the physical mechanisms determining mixing. On the other hand the present investigation aims at determining relevant parameters based on fluid mechanics aspect that will facilitate the process of scale up/down between stirred tank reactors and shaken flasks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>232234</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The outcome of this research has lead to a follow up collaboration and a project with industrial partner Kuhner AG.

These types of low shear systems are extensively used in the pharmaceutical and bio-process industries during the early stages of bioprocess development because they offer a low power consumption solution to screen several operating conditions in parallel (i.e. simultanously). This low energy requirement, combined with the well-defined gas-liquid interface occurring in shaken bioreactors, provides an optimum environment for mammalian cell cultivation in terms of oxygen transfer and cell metabolism. Once the process is optimised at small scale, it is then adapted to large stirred tank reactors (STRs), which is the type of bioreactor most commonly used in the industry at a production level. Contrary to shaken bioreactors, STRs have been thoroughly characterized in the literature. It should be emphasised however that cell growth and environmental conditions vary significantly between shaken cultures and those encountered in large STRs. This often becomes a bottleneck in bio-process development as cells respond differently to the different shapes and mixing mechanisms taking place in the two scales and types of bioreactors. These differences, together with other drawbacks of STRs have prompted the industry to look at production scale of Orbitally Shaken Bioreactors (OSRs), and for example bioreactor-manufacturing companies such as K&amp;uuml;hner AG and Sartorius have adopted this strategy.



The current project aimed at bridging the gap between shaken bioreactor systems and stirred tank reactors and at providing improved tools and methodologies for scaling up/down a process developed in a shaken bioreactor to a stirred tank at the production level. Most of the research was carried out to study the flow dynamics inside the two systems because it directly or indirectly affects all the key parameters, namely stress level, oxygenation, and mixing of nutrients that ultimately determine and promote the cell growth in the bioreactor. From this perspective the main finding of the current project was to identify a series of non-dimensional scaling parameters (Froude number, non dimensional fluid height, orbital to bioreactor diameter ratio and Reynolds number) and to correlate them into a scaling law that can be used to predict and select optimum flow and mixing conditions for cell growth. The major advantage of having a non-dimensional law is its universality as it allows to reproduce similar conditions in shaken bioreactors of very different size. As previously mentioned this is extremely useful for those company who have adopted the strategy of implementing large shaken bioreactor at a production scale and therefore it is not surprising that Kuhner AG have decided to sponsor a PhD studentship to continue the research started with the fellowship. Comparison of the flow and shear levels in stirred tanks and shaken bioreactors have also allowed to identify analogous flow structures that occurs in the two systems: more specifically the precessional macro-instability occurring in stirred tank reactor recall that occurring in shaken system at high rotational speed. This analogy should be further investigated in future research as it provides the springboard to keep improving scaling up/down methodologies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Pharmaceutical, biochemical and bio-process industries are potential beneficiaries of the research carried out under this grant, and for example the results produced under the fellowship have already attracted Kuhner AG, a swiss company, to sponsor a PhD student to continue the research in shaken bioreactor. 1) Development of new bioreactors
