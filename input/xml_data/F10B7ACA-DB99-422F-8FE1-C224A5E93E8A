Individuals are increasingly interested in knowing more about their health and ways to improve it through changes in diet or exercise, with tests available to determine the risk of developing a disease. Early detection of abnormalities in a sample (e.g. blood), can help diagnose diseases; however, patients are often not aware they are ill or at risk, which results in late diagnosis and treatment. Developing new technologies to allow early diagnosis and screen people for the invisible tell-tale signs of disease is, therefore, important as this will impact on a) health-screening services which are becoming a rapidly growing business worldwide, and b) for the NHS to reduce the cost of treatment and to help people live longer, healthier lives in the UK.

Our immune system produces specific antibodies during disease, which can also be used to diagnose disease in lab tests. However, antibodies outside the body do not survive long, especially in warm environments. This makes testing unstable, expensive and requires chemicals to visualise the disease-causing molecule or organism. This creates transport and storage problems for testing kits, especially in the developing world, where testing for Ebola and Zika viruses (amongst others) and drug-resistance bacteria are a concern.

New chemistry approaches have started to be developed, which make 'miniature antibodies' that will fluoresce a different colour when they find the disease-causing agent. Miniaturised antibodies, called multicyclic peptides are a significant advance over existing technologies, since they are: a) more stable to temperature and bodily fluids (last longer), b) 100-times smaller than antibodies (can get places that antibodies can't reach), c) cheaper to manufacture, d) conceptually designable to target any cause of disease, e) will not require additional chemicals to visualise the cause; f) the same shape as antibodies and made from the same building blocks, and so, look the same to e.g. bacteria.

The project will:

a) First make a group of peptides, which will share some of the same important features of an antibody for recognising disease-causing agents. Advantageously, these can be purposely designed and made rapidly compared with producing antibodies. However, at this stage, they are not the correct shape to recognise a 'target'.

b) Optimise methods to attach these to a fluorescent 'template' (polyfluoroaryl-porphyrin) to hold it in the correct shape to appear to be the same as a much larger and more complex antibody. 

c) Finally, we will measure properties of the 'miniature antibodies', including how bright it fluoresces under UV light, how long it survives e.g. in blood or at higher temperature, and use techniques to see what shape it is i.e. how similar it is to an antibody. 

Through partnering with a UK biotechnology company, we will conduct some preliminary work to understand how these can be used to detect, for example, antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs' or the Clostridium difficile toxin - a major cause of hospital-acquired illness.

In future, we envisage that these new miniature antibodies will be used in testing kits that can be used for health screening at home, in the developing world, hospitals and in research labs around the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research affords new methods to make novel important 3D peptide architectures that provides a step-change for bio-sensing/detection and for new innovative medicines. Compared with standard detection tools (antibodies), multicyclic peptide detection tools are low cost, easily manufactured, designable and stable. This makes them suitable for clinical/laboratory/home diagnostic testing kits. 

Societal impact: Early detection of biomarkers and, therefore, diagnosis, provides the best approach to reduce the societal, economic and personal impact of disease. People in the UK are increasingly monitoring their health (blood glucose/cholesterol levels, wearing fitness trackers or interested in any predisposition to disease as they get older). Preventative monitoring supports early action before symptoms, or treatment before illnesses become serious. Given existing technologies can be expensive, the new lower cost, stable and sensitive technologies will make monitoring more widely accessible to a growing market in the UK. Long term, this will provide a pathway for a) improved health and wellbeing through understanding the causes or triggers of disease, b) the development of new tailored medicines. 

Economic impact: Preventable diseases place an economic strain on the NHS (cardiovascular disease cost the UK &amp;pound;4.3 billion (2013-14)). The emergence of companies dedicated to providing personalised health monitoring and early diagnosis avoids the need for expensive medicines. The main players in multicyclic peptide technology are European based (Pepscan, Bicycle Therapeutics), however, the UK is not providing sufficient competition in this technical area. New technologies provide new impetus and wealth-creation potential (The global sensor market is worth $490 billion and growing (over 10% annually)). The UK pharmaceutical sector has recently declined, in part, due to the lack of new chemical entities (access to new chemical space) for disease treatment. This work will revel a 'new wave' of 3D chemical molecules providing an impetus for developing new medicines for challenging diseases. Deliverables in the longer term (5-10 years) will result in a) international investment in UK science, b) pharmaceutical jobs, c) new UK business start-ups, d) NHS cost savings. 

Commercial impact: The methods and tools will be patented and opportunities for spin-outs or licensing explored. For example, based upon initial discussions with CRC, UK companies, such as Absynth Biologics (microbial detection and vaccines) and Randox Health - a global (UK-based) leader in healthcare technologies, are expected to benefit from the novel tools that will enhance their R&amp;amp;D capacity and productivity. Outputs from the research could become a key part of commercial field-deployable health-testing kits e.g. for STIs or in lab-on-a-chip applications that link to smart phones; as well as companion diagnostics for stratified/personalised medicine. This can in turn attract large R&amp;amp;D investment from international organisations and big pharma e.g. MedImmune/AstraZeneca. 

Training: Training researchers in peptide chemistry will provide highly skilled workers for academia or companies in the growing life science sector. There is a shortage of skilled peptide chemists in the UK, which has been identified by a local commercial peptide synthesis company, Bachem UK, St Helens (personal communication). We will continue to provide undergraduate projects in conjunction with Bachem, which will in turn, inform teaching. Therefore, training through this programme will enhance the skills and address shortfalls and knowledge-gaps in this area.

This proposal aligns with EPSRC strategy by i) ensuring a supply of excellent scientists into UK industry and public bodies; ii) supporting the development of new technologies that improve lives and boost the economy, and iii) staying healthier for longer as lifespans increase and society ages.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100602</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R020299/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02567418-12CB-462E-9092-530C6E63B359</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
