The CREST philosophy is that software engineering can be thought of as a search for good quality solutions within a potentially enormous search space, while balancing many different competing, sometimes conflicting, objectives. We believe that this philosophy is important in all engineering disciplines, but it is in Software Engineering where it finds its greatest potential. The materials and artifacts used in software engineering are very different; they are pure processes and information, essentially without physical manifestation. This makes the search--based optimisation agenda particularly apposite and offers the significant advantage of automation. The work supported by this platform proposal will develop, extend and disseminate this agenda of Automated Optimisation in Software Engineering.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>925401</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Various consultancy projects have been undertaken by members of the group supported by this platform grant.

The platform grant an able just to retain key researchers, many of whom are world leading research is in their own right, or have become so, during the course of their involvement on the grant, as members of the CREST centre, supported by the grant.

The nature of platform grant is that they hold a group together, and so research findings associated with this award and more usually associated with related projects, but without the platform grant, several of these important findings would not have been possible. We would have lost key staff who have contributed to these research outputs on other grants without the platform grant.

And example of this is the field of genetic improvement, through which software systems are automatically improved using techniques associated with genetic programming. This area of research is now blossoming all round the world, and is primarily associated with our program grant DAASE (dynamic adaptive automated software engineering). However, one of the key researchers in this topic, Dr Bill Langdon, was only retained in the centre as a result of the platform grant, and many of the findings associated with the field of genetic improvement would not have been possible without his retention.

Genetic improvement of our software systems to be dramatically improved, reducing their energy consumption, improving their response time and reducing their consumption of resources, all automatically achieved, using genetic programming and related techniques. Dr Langdon is undoubtedly one of the worlds leading experts in this area, and the program grant was instrumental in allowing us to retain him, and we deploy him on the DAASE grant.

The platform grant was also used to initiate the highly influential CREST open workshop series, which is now had over 1,500 attendees, from all of the leading research institutions in suffering during around the world. More information about the CREST open workshop is available on the CREST website at

The work with Microsoft was submitted has an impact case study to the REF2014 for King's College.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94DCBF89-45B1-4E98-B5DE-1A09C0E305AF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df0b5797a235.62974132</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The GP Bibliography is a repository of all publications on the topic of genetic programming, which is maintained by Bill Langdon (William B. Langdon). The repository has been available since before 2006, but since 2011, its maintenance has been supported by the EPSRC project GISMO, which funds, in full, Dr Langdon. It was started by Dr langdon when he was at the University of Birmingham, though he has been at University College London since 2010. The University of Birmingham continues to host the repository, while support for its maintenance and update by Dr langdon comes from UCL, through GISMO Project. Before the GISMO Project, Dr langdon was funded by the CREST platform grant and SEBASE projects.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FB22968D-EFF2-40AF-9948-B63CB8EE13CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Repository contains over 7000 entries, and is widely used by other researchers.
