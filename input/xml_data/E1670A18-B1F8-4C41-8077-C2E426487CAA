While there is now a considerable body of research that has examined the socio-economic impacts of flooding and other weather event outcomes, the existing work either tends to be too narrow in focus (such as the cost of insurance claims), pitched at a macro scale (at the National or European level, for example), limited to the immediate effects of the event (such as insurance claims), or primarily qualitative or descriptive in nature. There is a very real need, therefore, to develop an integrated model that will facilitate the quantitative analysis of extreme weather events at a community level (such as postcode or postcode sector level); consider the direct impacts on a range of sectors; consider the interconnectedness of these sectors and hence the indirect impacts of an extreme weather event; and consider lagged effects as well as the contemporaneous effects. The goal of this project is to develop an empirical model in conjunction with stakeholders that will meet these requirements and provide stakeholders with an integrated decision making framework that will enable them to explore short and long term EWE scenarios.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>263333</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Event held in Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1984375C-FD3B-4B85-AFA3-9D6B2F2A9724</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One day event in Westminster with attendees drawn from government departments, the insurance sector and the voluntary sector.

We developed what we believe is the first spatial econometric model of the impact of flood risk (as opposed to particular flood events) on the location of employment. Our results showed a significant negative effect of flood risk on employment location.
? We estimated what we believe is the first model of flood risk impacts to incorporate the impact of agglomeration economies: a major omission in the literature on the socio-economic impacts of flood risk is the failure to explore the mitigating effects of proximity to other firms in the wider urban area. Our results showed that agglomeration economies play a significant role in mitigating the impacts of flood risk. This is important because it suggests that flood risk may have a more deleterious effect on employment in areas where economic agglomeration is weak.
? We sought to base these models on a high-resolution measure of employment location that would allow us to capture the local effects of flood risk-most previous studies consider employment patterns at much higher levels of geographical aggregation.
? We also developed what we believe to be the first model of flood risk impacts to allow for connections between employment and house prices (achieved by developing a GMM two-stage least squares spatial econometric model). Our results suggested that the feedback effects from house prices to employment were weak.
? We also estimated a number of models of house prices which took into account feedback effects from employment and deprivation. Our results showed that these feedback effects significantly increased the overall impact on house prices of increases in flood risk.
? Drawing on insights from the economic psychology and sociology of risk literatures, we developed a theoretical framework to help clarify the interpretation of flood risk/flood event impacts on socio-economic variables. One of the important corollaries of this conceptual model was that the responsiveness of house prices and employment to changes in flood risk are likely to increase over time (because the drivers of inertia-&amp;quot;amnesia&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;myopia&amp;quot;-are likely to diminish as floods become more frequent).
? We have helped develop the theory of housing submarkets and access to employment which are crucial for understanding how housing and labour markets will respond to changing flood risk.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Outputs from the project have been cited more than 43 times in leading international journals including Urban flood impact assessment: A state-of-the-art

This omission is particularly anomalous in the context of climate change. We extend the literature in four ways. First, we argue that competition for land between ?rms and households will generate an endogenous role for house prices, which we estimate using a generalised method of moments two-stage least squares spatial econometric model. Second, we model interaction effects between agglomeration and ?ood-risk using a gravity-based agglomeration measure. Third, we utilise a high-resolution ?ood-risk measure which incorporates both ?ood frequency and
severity. Fourth, we use a high-resolution measure of employment to capture local effects. We ?nd that agglomeration economies have a signi?cant mitigating effect on ?ood-risk. This is potentially important because it suggests that ?oodrisk may have a more deleterious effect on employment in areas where economic agglomeration is weak. Policy-makers, insurers and planners cannot, therefore, assume a uniform effect of future changes to ?ood-risk as a result of climate change, and this needs to be taken into account when estimating the costs and bene?ts of interventions to reduce or underwrite ?ood-risk at particular locations. Our model offers a robust methodological basis for such
estimation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>80AD43F2-153E-4BD8-8CE8-82B94699AC7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Helped provide methodological solutions to modelling the impact of flood risk on employment.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff111aa9d47.95054739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>First spatial econometric model of the impact of flood risk (as opposed to particular flood events) on the location of employment</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Community Impact Simulator toolkit as part of the WISP (What If Scenario Portal) Google Maps web interface (see www.extreme-weather-impacts.net), developed in collaboration with Dr Stephen Hallett and colleagues at the University of Cranfield.
