We may connect them to each other by (or lines, or wire). For practical reasons, there can be onlyso many synapses coming out of a single neuron. At the same time, we want a good brain:- there should be a short path between any two neurons,- impulses broadcast by a neuron (or set of neurons) should reach a large number of neurons rapidly,- any shock to the system should be diffused, rather than build up,and so on.We may constrain ourselves to the case of brains built from abstract groups and their generators. (Example: neurons = 3-by-3 tables with the days of the week as entries; create synapse between two neurons if the quotient of the two corresponding tables is one of two very specific tables.) The brain then has the arguably desirable property of looking the same from any neuron, if looked at from the right angle. More importantly, the kind of problems we are looking at then have two sets of parallel interpretations and applications. At the same time that we look at expansion in graphs, we look at growth in groups; together with the applications suggested above, we hope for applications to the random generation of elements of groups. (In other words: is leaving the local pub drunk a very good way to reach a completely random corner in the city?)This area of problems remained largely open for a long time. Some brains had been proven to be good, by means of highly ingenious and complex arguments involving the spectral theory of automorphic forms, among other fields. However, few general techniques were known.There is an area of mathematics that, until recently, seemed unrelated to all of the above. Additive combinatorics studies the integers, and, more generally, so-called abelian groups. (All groups directly involved in brain problems are necessarily non-abelian; abelian groups yield very bad brains.) Within abelian groups, additive combinatorics studies - among other things - whether a given set of elements grows when all elements act upon each other.I have recently proven that all subsets of groups in a basic family (SL_2(Z/pZ)) grow rapidly in a specific sense. This sense stems from additive combinatorics, and so do the main techniques used in the proof. One obtains readily that SL_2(Z/pZ) yields good brains in the sense that there is always a short path between any two given neurons. Other researchers have shown that other kinds of growth (or senses of being a good brain ) can also be derived from my main result; this includes most senses of growth native to the study of group theory and growth in graphs.My project is to prove that all abstract groups in a very broad class - that of classical groups over finite fields - possess rapid growth in many senses. This I propose to do by a generalisation and refinement of my approach for SL_2(Z/pZ). The approach is based on additive combinatorics, and thus will be understandable to a broad mathematical audience.The project will branch out into many consequences and applications, only some of which I intend to pursue myself. Of necessity, I will have to act as a populariser of my main techniques and as a facilitator of their further use. I am also greatly interested in learning the techniques of the areas to which the results of my project should apply. (All of this has already started for SL_2.)One of my main interests as a member of the mathematical community is to establish as many links as possible between the mathematical centres of different countries. I recently returned from a research trip to India, and plan to teach for a month in Brasil; before, I gave short courses in Peru and Cuba, in addition to my regular duties at my base institutions. My current project seems amenable to broad communication: deriving some of its consequences will require great ingenuity, but perhaps not extremely sophisticated techniques. Interest seems to be general, and applications plentiful.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>643342</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My main results on SL_2 and SL_3 have been generalized to all linear algebraic groups (Pyber-Szabo, Breuillard-Green-Tao) and applied to the study of expander graphs.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E024F50D-9C4E-4B9A-B744-48FB425DF8CF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54635a12d98a09.74376061</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E054919/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
