&lt;p>During the Fellowship a programme of research studying imitation in adults with ASD will be developed. This will look at the relationship between intentional imitation and non-conscious imitative behaviours, such as contagious yawning and automatic mimicry of other people. It will relate these abilities to other aspects of social cognition, such as understanding others? minds, feeling empathy, and self-awareness. The aim is to increase understanding of the specific difficulties faced by people with ASD and help to guide development of intervention strategies. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The award holder will also publish the results of previous research on imitation ability in a large, UK based, population sample of young twins. This investigated the relationship between imitation skills at two years of age and other aspects of social ability (language, pretend play, socially-insightful behaviour) and disability (ASD). Additionally, the Fellow will be trained in a number of new research techniques in order to become established as an independent autism researcher. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84404</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imitation in autism</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA2E5115-5ACE-48FA-9EB4-660859F15CDE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Half-day conference to critically evaluate the idea that difficulties with imitation or mirror-neuron dysfunction is the core deficit in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and discuss the implications that these ideas have for those working with people with ASD. This was organised by the Postdoctoral Research Fellow as part of the fellowship.

After the event, which I organised as part of my fellowship, I received feedback from attendees stating that the event had encouraged them to engage critically with the ideas discussed on the day, and had made links across different disciplines and groups (e.g., researchers had the chance to speak to teachers, adults with ASD, etc).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3379044340.34511852b491036</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this research was to explore the hypothesis that impaired imitation, or dysfunctional mirror neuron system, might be a core deficit in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The mirror neuron system is a brain system that is thought to allow matching of actions we perform to actions that we see others do, and it has been suggested that this system might not work typically in those with ASD. 



Findings from toddlers with ASD were mixed: many two year olds with ASD showed imitation impairment that was not explained by low verbal or nonverbal skills or by poor engagement with tasks in general. However, a sizeable proportion was reported to imitate well. This suggests that impaired imitation is unlikely to be necessary or sufficient in the development of autistic difficulties. Furthermore, it suggests that the mirror neuron system can function in many children with ASD. 



However, it is possible that children with ASD are less likely to spontaneously imitate in real life situations and there may be a subgroup for whom imitation is particularly difficult. Ongoing autistic communication difficulties were predicted by global language and cognitive delay rather than problems with imitation. This suggests that imitation impairment may be secondary to autistic symptoms, and not the cause of them. 



Work with adults confirmed this: there was a wide range of imitation ability and susceptibility to contagious effects in both adults with ASD and typical adults. There was some evidence that adults with ASD were not as conscious of their response to contagious effects as typical adults, and this mismatch between behaviour and feelings may relate to alexithymia, which is a difficulty identifying and describing one's own feelings which commonly occurs in ASD.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The fellowship also provided for the running of a half-day conference, Imitation in Autism, which was attended by interested lay people, adults with ASD, family members, teachers, therapists, journalists, and advocates. Feedback after the event indicated that many of those who attended found the the event very useful in their work and understanding of this aspect of autism. The discussion between invited speakers and the diverse audience helped to develop ideas about how and in what ways imitative behaviours may be affected in ASD, and about how preserved skills might be used therapeutically.

This fellowship award was of immense benefit to the fellow, who has found two subsequent positions that involve running research studies that further knowledge of autism and related conditions. The project management skills that she began to develop during the fellowship have enabled her to gain her most recent position, which involves setting up and managing an ambitious study of 1,000 Syrian refugee children in Lebanon in a bid to understand resilience in children exposed to war and displacement. 

Results have the potential to have an impact on the research community, in terms of challenging and developing existing theories of ASD, and helping to shape further research. Dissemination of published results to wider groups should also help to shape the way that the relative strengths and difficulties of people with ASD are understood and used in developing interventions. Results have been reported in a paper under review with the scientific journal Autism Research, at an international conference, at departmental meetings and through informal discussion with colleagues. Further results will be reported in the scientific literature. 

Furthermore, the project has supported an undergraduate placement student and three MSc students, providing research projects and valuable research experience.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2A2EF697-408A-4703-B462-F257B193CD6B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3659276397.5814695b2f0a354</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is a novel method of coding alexithymia, using interview responses and observations from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or from a stand alone interview.
