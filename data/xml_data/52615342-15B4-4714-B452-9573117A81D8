Following the visit from Callie Kaplan to the UK in January 2013, IWES received additional Kellogg Foundation funding to implement the neighborhood health and wellbeing study. 
Following Billy Gazard's visit in August 2013, we negotiated a plan for Billy to apply for ESRC Overseas Institutional Visit (OIV) to IWES. The application was successful and will take place from January to March 2014. Billy will gain experience withing this translational US non-profit public health organization that has been working with New Orleans communities for the last twenty years and specialises in applied public health, community engagement and policy development. He will be engaging in these areas of work to gain greater understanding of how research findings can be translated into action to affect both policy development and community well-being, as well as how research goals can be shaped at the grassroots level; offering him experiences that are not provided in a University environment. In addition, other benefits of the visit include the establishment of international collaborations with researchers at IWES and their partner organisations; dissemination of preliminary PhD research findings to varied audiences and participation in seminars at both IWES and Tulane University. Tulane University is a reputable academic institution based in New Orleans with an established School of Public Health. Billy will present preliminary results from the quantitative and qualitative SELCoH data that are part of his PhD. He will attend the Epidemiology seminars at Tulane University and contribute a lecture on structural discrimination and stress to a course led by Dr. Katherine Theall. Planned joint outputs (data analysis, publications, etc) are in progress and planned.
On 15 November 2013, HERON hosted an interactive event with PhD students and postdoctoral researchers within the Department of Psychological Medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London with Dr Lisa Richardson (IWES Director of Research and Development) entitled, &amp;quot;Translational Public Health: Incorporating Community Voices in Research&amp;quot;
Several senior and early career researchers from IWES attended and contributed to the HERON conference in May 2014 in London. For example, Dr Denese Shervington (IWES President and CEO) presented New Orleans community research in a session chaired by Dr Lisa Richardson (IWES Director of Research and Development); Chloe Walters-Wallace MA (IWES Media Coordinator) co-chaired a session on the use of art in community health participatory research; Iman Shervington MFA (IWES Director of Media and Social Marketing) provided photography documentation and live documentation of the event on social media during the 2 day conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cb497d211d4.43476057-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Denese Shervington provides her expertise in US psychiatry and Dr Lisa Richardson provides expertise translational public health approaches in urban settings--both of which are not areas of expertise represented within the US-UK comparative team for the main research project. IWES staff has provided training in participatory research, interventions and social media engagement. 
In January 2013, the IWES sent Callie Kaplan MPH, IWES Research &amp;amp; Evaluation Manager, to work with members of the UK team in London to develop a strategy for applying the SELCoH study design model in New Orleans east and central New Orleans Parishes. Dr Hatch provided housing for Ms Kaplan and IWES funded the remaining costs through their Kellogg Foundation funded project, Collective for Healthy Communities (CHC).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The SELCoH study team advised with Institute of Women and Ethnic Studies (IWES; New Orleans, Louisiana, USA) staff on the development of a similar study in New Orleans Louisiana. 
Dr Hatch (PI) has been an IWES board member since 2009. 
Dr Hatch gave an invited lecture in 2012 entitled, &amp;quot;Stress and Mental Health Inequalities among Youth in the Community&amp;quot; during The Root of It All: The State of Mental Health of New Orleans' Youth conference hosted by IWES and Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.
In August 2013, Billy Gazard (SELCoH PhD student supervised by Stephani Hatch (PI) and funded through by ESRC through KISS-DTC) represented the UK HERON team during a visit with the Collective for Healthy Communities (CHC) team at the Institute of Women and Ethnic Studies (IWES; New Orleans, Louisiana, USA) while in the US for the American Sociological Association meeting. The IWES team provided housing for Billy and the CHC project hosted three Brownbag lunches in which Billy led seminars to discuss a community-based mental health survey and dissemination techniques that are being utilized by the UK team in SELCoH research in Southeast London. The seminars included the following:
? 20 August 2013: Overview of the South East London Community Health Study (SELCoH) and the Health Inequalities Research Network (HERON)
? 22 August 2013: Recruiting in the local community, fieldwork experiences and survey design in a community epidemiology study

Other team members from the US and UK acted as invited speakers, session chairs and discussants. The conference featured the distinguished keynote speaker, Dr. David Williams (Harvard University; Florence Sprague Norman &amp;amp; Laura Smart Norman Professor of Public Health, Professor of African and African American Studies and of Sociology) who is a consultant and collaborator on the US-UK research teams for the current grant. 
We had presentations and posters addressing the following themes within health inequalities research:
 ? Comparing local and national disparities 
? Public involvement or engagement in research
? Cross-country comparative studies
? Life-course epidemiology
? Physical and mental health co-morbidity
? Neighbourhood contexts
? Structural discrimination and health
? Minority stress and health
? Young people's health
? Ethnicity, migration and health
? Gendered health
? Sexual health
? Health service use

The workshop brought together community activists, trans* organisations, academic researchers and policy-makers together to focus on matters of trans* health, inequalities and well-being, particularly as these relate to trans* communities' struggles for social and legal equality, and access to adequate healthcare provisions. A core focus of the event was to explore the potential for developing collaborative alliances between trans* organisations and academic researchers interested in advancing the cause of transgender health inequalities and well-being with attendees outlining steps necessary to facilitate collaborations. Talks generated a lively debate and brought together people across sectors that had not previously met. 
Community organisations and services in attendance: Race Equality Foundation, Trans Media Watch, TransBareAll, CliniQ, GALOP, LGBT Foundation, Central and North West London NHS Trust, NHS EnglandThe speakers included: Jay McNeal (Lancaster University), Liam Timmins (KCL), Samir Jeraj (Race Equality Foundation), Suzannah Yong Lee (Race Equality Foundation), Helen Belcher (Trans Media Watch), Habib Naqvi (NHS England), Ruth Pearce (Warwick University), Zowie Davy (University of Lincoln), Lee Gale (TransBareAll), Michelle Ross (CliniQ) and Serge Nicholson (CliniQ)

Several speakers stated afterwards that they had formed new collaborative links.

Titled 'Understanding inequalities and the impact they have on health: findings from a community sample', the sessions aimed to disseminate findings from the South East London Community Health Study (SELCoH) and stimulate wider discussion as to what the main factors causing health inequalities may be. Three SELCoH research assistants, Bwalya Kankulu, Billy Gazard and Natasha Smyth delivered the sessions.



To ensure the presentations were interactive and engaging, a range of teaching methods were employed. These included facilitated group work using recent media articles highlighting scenarios of various social inequalities. The students were asked to think about ways in which these scenarios could lead to health inequalities and discuss more generally the multiple levels at which discrimination operates. Health profiles created by the Department of Health were also used to stimulate discussion around neighbourhood inequalities. Students were asked to compare the recorded health outcomes for Lambeth against the borough of Kensington and Chelsea and discuss disparities between areas. Debate was also used to explore responsibility for health, with students split into two groups, the first being asked to represent 'the individual', and the second being asked to represent 'the society'. 



Thirty five students in total attended the two sessions, which were run at the Clapham Common site. The team received positive feedback from students attending and so there are plans to offer these teaching sessions to other colleges in the area.

Lambeth College Art and Drama department requested our involvement in their lessons on social and health inequalities.

Representatives from a variety of charities and organisations working within Southwark and Lambeth were invited to the event to discuss their organisations' services in Southwark and Lambeth (site of the SELCoH study), highlight problems in health and accessing health care that are specific to their service users, and strategies that can be used to empower individuals and their communities and strengthen collaborative links between organisations. A lively discussion and debate with the audience addressed the evening's theme of health and wellbeing, inequalities in health and community empowerment.

A community organisation, Faces in Focus, requested collaboration on understanding discrimination and health experiences among young adults in South East London; Lambeth College requested health inequalities workshop for their Health and Social Care BTEC students which led to involvement of Lambeth College art and drama students in collaborative project with Faces in Focus (Your Shout).

The following examples highlight some of the impact that directly arose from the research grant.

To engage with the community, the HERON Network presented locally relevant data from the South East London Community Health Study [SELCoH] study to the public during Research Road Shows focused on how the findings may be useful for communities. The Brixton library event was in conjunction with a local authority health check event offering consultations and advice on physical health problems (e.g., hypertension and diabetes); we used project findings to discuss the interrelationship between physical and mental health. 

HERON also coordinates joint engagement with schools and third sector community organisations. 
For example, The Interview was co-produced by HERON members, Lambeth College BTEC Art students and service users from Faces in Focus (an advice, support and counselling service for young people in Southwark and Lambeth). Following a series of meetings and workshops, the project culminated in a public local gallery exhibition of mixed medium art inspired and made in response to a series of interviews that took place between HERON facilitators, students and young service users. Locally relevant SELCoH study results on perceived and anticipated discrimination experiences were integral to planning the interviews and contextualising this work. KCL Public Engagement provided additional funds to support a public showcase; the four day exhibition was attended by the public, students, family, friends, teachers, academics, school administrators, service users and staff from Faces in Focus, and health service providers. Subsequently, Lekan Lawal, a recent recipient of the Arts Council England Regional Theatre Young Director Scheme, contacted HERON to collaborate on the development of a theatre piece on discrimination, race and mental health for his residency.

Additionally, HERON ran an interactive Creativity and Mental Health workshop with staff and volunteers at Raw Material, a production house in Brixton that promotes opportunities, engagement and progression in creative and expressive arts for excluded people to reduce non-engagement, anti-social behaviour, re-offending and mental health relapse. The workshop focused on mental health benefits of creative arts interventions and how researchers can work more closely with local organisations to tackle discrimination and social exclusion using a variety of media. Following this engagement, Raw Materials took part in the 2014 HERON Conference.

Examples of school engagement include (1) interactive workshops with Health and Social Care BTEC students at Lambeth College, led by SELCoH research assistants and HERON coordinators to discuss possible determinants of health inequalities; and (2) annual Sociology, Psychology and Health youth awards to inspire local students to stay in education and develop a social science career. In addition to receiving mentoring, student work experience included co-producing an engagement event for the National Young Peoples Takeover Day with the national Young People's Mental Health Advisory Group. One of the HERON award recipients was subsequently invited to be a member of a research steering group and joined the HERON planning group as student representative.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AEB9E299-70C2-44FD-ACA1-EF9C978990ED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55c9d49950f254.03848988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Aligned with one of the study objectives, the UK and US teams have collectively developed the Health Inequalities Research Network (HERON) to formalise and sustain a network of people involved in action and research in inequalities in health and health service use. This international network consists of students, health practitioners, researchers, community members and representatives from third sector charities and community organisations. The basic principle of the network is to develop and promote the interaction of health practitioners and researchers with community members and representatives in order to have a more collaborative approach to research within the community. The network has explored various routes to engage and interact with its members and the wider community on topics relevant to social inequalities, including discrimination, and inequalities in health and functioning. The network has also shared best practice and provided infrastructure support for new public and patient engagement groups, such as the South East London Photography (SELPh) group founded in 2011 by HERON co-coordinator, Billy Gazard, photographer Anthony Wallace and Consultant Psychiatrist Wojtek Wojcik. With funding from the Maudsley charity, Gazard and other HERON members use SELPh to provide an opportunity for groups of people recovering from mental illness to express their experiences of social and health inequalities and wellbeing creatively using innovative participatory photography. SELPh has facilitated four series of 14-week sessions, all of which culminated in exhibitions showcasing the group's work. 
The UK socio-historical documentation has contributed to an increase in understanding of how discrimination influences health, and advanced the thinking of how it should be conceptualized and measured. The discrimination measures adapted for this study have been used in several clinical research projects, explored in qualitative studies in more depth and provided the basis for our more successful HERON PPE events with schools and local community organisations. 
Findings from the UK data generated new research questions around the fluctuation of the demography of discrimination and shifts in the basis and targets of discrimination as political and social issues change. This was particularly highlighted when we considered the relationship between discrimination and mental health among migrant and ethnic groups, regardless of race. Presentation and discussion of this finding resulted in HERON forming a collaboration with individuals at the Department of Social Science, Health &amp;amp; Medicine (King's College London) and Citizens UK to develop a seminar series focussed on applying intersectional approaches to address health inequalities. The seminar series is designed to be international in scope, inviting key academic speakers from the US to engage with UK academics, students and community organisations. Participation will be sought from a range of health services, policy and civil society organisations engaged in transformative approaches to addressing health inequalities. The aims of the series include: identifying examples of current best practice in research, policy and services; fostering lasting collaborative exchanges between civil society and academic researchers; establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness of health policies in addressing intersecting health inequalities; and, to develop a future programme of action research which will systematically apply intersectional perspectives and methods to improving health and wellbeing.
Preliminary findings from the US and UK data demonstrated how little is known about discrimination experiences, particularly anticipated discrimination, in relation to health service use. As a result, members of the UK team have developed new collaborations on multiple research projects that are assessing discrimination as a potential barrier to health service use. Further progress is being made in this area, including projects that aim to develop interventions for health service providers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Health services and practitioners are among the potential beneficiaries of this research. This has been exemplified in the interest in addressing discrimination experiences, particularly anticipated discrimination, in relation to health service use, described above.
Within the community, there are charities and organizations involved in HERON that have utilized the findings to demonstrate the importance of considering how prevalent discrimination (particularly in education, employment, housing and health care) is as a source of stress and how it impacts the functioning and health, particularly mental health of service users.
Local schools can use this research to design and promote educational material aimed at attenuating the effect of discrimination on the health and health service use of students and staff. For the university, the findings are particularly relevant for the gender and race equality initiatives. 
Researchers and postgraduate students have taken the findings forward through the questions generated for postdoctoral fellowships, as well as MSc and PhD projects. Future projects with interdisciplinary teams are being planned in multicultural environments in the UK, other US sites and in Asia.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>44558F91-7DEB-45A6-B95C-73DC97C17725</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55cc71d0ed42e4.06589695</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collection of Phase 2 data for the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) study</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE972C9A-0E37-461F-A68A-6FC9BA5EB30B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data are being used for numerous PhD, DClin Psych and MSc projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d08c9a38a5.23791754</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SELCoH data -
