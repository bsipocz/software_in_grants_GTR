In these areas we will be addressing key science questions at the cutting edge of astrophysical research. Some examples of these are given here.

In the area of stellar astrophysics, we will solve some of the currently unanswered key questions in star formation, particularly those surrounding the formation, structure and evolution of prestellar cores, and the role played by magnetic fields in particular in this process. This is important, because there is believed to be a link between the core mass function and the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). It is planned that this will lead us to a true physical understanding of the origin of the IMF itself. We will also study the evolution of discs around protostars and the effects of binarity on planet formation, and model the migration of giant planets in discs around protostars to see how this is affected by stellar luminosity and the properties of the disc. In addition, we will also attempt to explore and understand internal angular momentum transport in hydrogen-burning, main-sequence stars, and we will search for the progenitors of supernovae.

In the areas of Galactic and extra-Galactic astrophysics (including the Milky Way as the nearest galaxy) we will investigate how the energy balance in the ISM, the conversion of gas into stars, and the IMF of the stellar progeny are affected by the dramatically changing physical conditions on galaxy-wide scales. We will probe the distribution of molecular gas and dust with high spatial resolution, to understand the origin of these components in dusty early-type galaxies. We will dissect the evolution of the Milky Way bulge, bar and disc, and compute orbits, in a suite of N-body+SPH simulations in order to help interpret Gaia data. Thereby we will better understand the role of the bar in the overall evolution of the Milky Way, as well as its mass assembly. For powerful Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) we will develop re-collimation shock simulations in jets to include additional physics and realistic conditions, in order to better understand these highly energetic phenomena</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our main Impact is primarily around Community Engagement, of which the primary beneficiaries are students at schools and colleges, as well as members of the broader community, in Lancashire. In addition via social media and partnerships with organisations beyond the county, our reach is global.

While there is an element of dissemination in much of this work, the real impact derives from demonstrating to the people of Lancashire that work of national and international importance is taking place on their doorstep, and they can both benefit and become involved. Lancashire has some significant areas of very low engagement in Higher Education, including one of the lowest regions, Burnley. Our engagement work allows us to influence aspirations amongst children from a young age, and maintain interest in physics-focused study through the critical teenage years. In addition some of the initiatives described in Pathways to Impact have regional (North West) and wider reach, demonstrating that such work is not restricted to the largest and most prestigious institutes that may not be perceived as accessible to those from under-represented communities.

Alston Observatory

We also run the Alston Observatory, about 8 miles from Preston, which is a purpose-built teaching facility. Also on the site are telescopes with a long history, as well as a new 0.7-metre teaching telescope. We run monthly star-gazing events for the public. We also have a Discovery Dome planetarium system, exhibits on Telescopes as Time Machines funded by the Royal Astronomical Society, and an outside experiment on Measuring the Cosmos. Discovery Dome is an exciting system that allows a laptop computer and digital projector to display movies onto a planetarium dome, as well as enhanced planetarium shows. This will enable both informative material to be presented for evening events, and educational material for curriculum enhancement. We run many outreach events at Alston, including Stargazing Live and other public observing evenings. We have links with many local astronomical societies. We also run many events for local schools at Alston. See:

Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory, Moor Park

We recently won, jointly with Preston City Council, a Heritage National Lottery Grant to improve amenities within Preston's central Moor Park. Of the &amp;pound;2M won in total, &amp;pound;100k was for the University to completely refurbish the Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory (JHO), located within Moor Park. The Observatory was opened in 1927. It had a long history of public observation, and is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year. However, it had fallen into disrepair by 2002. The refurbishment works included re-pointing and renovating the fabric of the building, including all new windows, a new door with disabled ramp access, and improved bathroom facilities, with disabled toilets, as well as complete re-wiring, replacing all plaster-boarding on all walls, new flooring throughout and complete re-decoration. This work was completed in December 2016. We are in the process of kitting out the building with new display materials, ready to open as a visitor centre for local schools and other interested groups in Spring/Summer 2017. Specifically, we will use the JHO to reach out to Lancashire's multicultural community, particularly the UK's largest Muslim population, located in the area immediately surrounding Moor Park. Schools in this area may not be able to afford to bus groups out to Alston, but could visit Moor Park much more easily. We will turn the JHO into an outreach facility run as a collaboration between the University of Central Lancashire and a host of partner organisations, including Preston City Council, delivering outreach to gatekeeper partners. This is a central plank of our new 5-year Outreach Plan.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>901952</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R000786/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B43E1E82-2962-4C36-87AD-95AC01BE0A9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC478D98-EB7D-4905-B536-D9D61AFD07E4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Galactic &amp; Interstellar Astron</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6D4F9380-A853-4602-9383-3E0067A53A84</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stellar Astronomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
