One way to find out about members of the public?s preferences is to ask them in surveys using methods such as ?discrete choice experiments? (DCEs). DCEs involve respondents making choices between various options through which they reveal their preferences for the features describing the options. During my doctoral research I developed new methods to analyse data collected in DCEs and I demonstrated these in the area of treatment for cardiac arrest occurring in a public place. This Fellowship would allow me to disseminate the results of my doctoral research and use them in further analysis as well as to move onto new research in which I will apply DCE methods to investigate preferences for different types of drinking water and related health effects. I also plan to undertake a study visit to work with and learn from world experts in the field of DCEs. In addition to future career development, additional outcomes of the Fellowship would be to improve DCE methods which can be used to inform, develop and evaluate health policy with the objective of ultimately improving health.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>As part of my doctoral work I developed a new analytical method to analyse data from discrete choice experiments (DCEs), the sequential best worst multinomial logit, which I used to estimate choice models for single individuals. This is a first in health economics and was the first application more broadly to estimate models for single individuals from a DCE using only data provided explicitly by respondents. Estimation of choice models at the level of single individuals offers a direct way of representing preference heterogeneity which avoids some of the drawbacks of other approaches. I also proposed a new approach to welfare measurement in the context of DCEs by harnessing models for single individuals to directly calculate measures of welfare, such as the Hicksian compensating variation, for single individuals which was also a first. These methods were applied in the context of treatment for cardiac arrest occurring in a public place.

My proposed programme of work for the Fellowship would build on my doctoral work and allow me to achieve several aims including providing time and resources to consolidate, disseminate, and expand beyond my doctoral research, providing further training and development opportunities. 

My proposed programme of work includes several aspects. First, dissemination and consolidation of my doctoral research via the submission of three papers for peer review publication and conference and seminar presentations. Second, additional analysis of my doctoral data will form the basis of a fourth paper using individual level choice models to test assumptions made in traditional pooled level DCE analysis. Third, new research in the context of preferences for drinking water and tradeoffs across various health risks will be undertaken during an overseas study visit to the University of Alberta which will include both formal and informal training. This will allow me to learn from experts in another field of DCEs, to bring such knowledge back to health economics and allow for cross fertilisation of these two important sectors. Finally, development of a research proposal harnessing DCEs to address important methodological and policy relevant questions to be submitted for consideration for future UK research funding. These outputs together would not only be beneficial to my career development and provide a solid basis on which to become a research leader in health economics, they would also add to and improve DCE methods for use in policy development and evaluation in health economics which ultimately aims to improve health outcomes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172649</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee Evaluation Subcommittee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Australia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E4A3472-2596-4FB4-A656-8CAF25C88B13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Role as Economist on the Medical Services Advisory Committe (MSAC) Evaluation Subcommittee (ESC).

ESC is a multidisciplinary standing committee of MSAC which provides advice on the applications being considered by MSAC.
