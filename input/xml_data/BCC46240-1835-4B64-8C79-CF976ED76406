Currently, succinic acid is predominantly manufactured from petrochemicals or by the fermentation of glucose/sugars. The bioconversion of crude glycerol will not only valourise this fully renewable side-stream which is essentially a biorefinery waste, hence significantly improving the biorefinery economy, but can also provide a sustainable production route with reduced carbon footprint and a favourable economic potential. Hence, the aim of this project is to holistically assess the feasibility of the route from the crude glycerol to the final succinic acid product. A combination of experimental methodologies at a range of scales, from the bench- to the pilot-scale, computational tools, including economic models and process simulators, and market analysis will be employed in order to: (i) prove the feasibility of the downstream process, (ii) benchmark the final succinic acid product against the chemical market standards, (iii) successfully optimise the scale up of the fermentation process to 750 litre bioreactors (iv) identify and engage commercial end users. These objectives should constitute a significant step in reducing the risk of the proposed bioprocess in order to attract industrial investments, hence moving closer towards its industrial uptake and application.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project is concerned with the bioproduction of Succinic Acid, a top added-value chemical from crude biorefinery glycerol, through batch fermentation, using an appropriately adapted strain of Actinobacillus Succinogenes. It involves a creative synergy between the academic process developers, industrial process implementation specialists as well as industrial process adopters. The aim of the project is to quantitatively assess the feasibility of this process in terms of the quality of the final product, compared to the market standards and of the efficiency of the fermentation at the pilot scale. In parallel market analysis will seek to engage end-users to the next stage of industrial research. A combination of experimental methods, covering a range of different scales from the bench- to the pilot scale, and computational tools will be employed for this purpose. In particular, the project aims to: experimentally verify the downstream process for the production of the final product, benchmark the final succinic acid against market standards, prove the feasibility of the fermentation scale-up in 750 L bioreactors, and computationally assess the economic and environmental feasibility of the overall process.

There is a number of innovative aspects involved, which have been filed in recent patent applications, including (i) the generation of an appropriately adapted strain with improved ability to convert glycerol to succinic acid (ii) an optimised fermentation methodology for SA production (iii) the development of validated predictive computational models of the bioprocess and (iv) the construction of integrated biorefinery simulators coupled with economic models of the process. There is also extensive know-how that is associated with the design and optimisation of the process.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As described in proposal submitted to TSB</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80313</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chemoxy International</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UoM-Chemoxy</gtr:description><gtr:id>53CD8DFB-42D7-41BD-AB05-6CD316A7F73E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Patents on the process are being filed.

It is important to recognise that we have developed a sustainable route to succinic acid which also presents a sustainable route to a 1,4 butanediol which is an intermediate for plastics, solvents, chemicals and fibres. 
Evidence from a study of end-users of succinic acid conducted by PHS Consulting suggests that there is market need for a sustainable source of BioSA providing the price is right. One respondent identified a competing source of BioSA as being too costly for the specification on offer. 
The feedback from the market was that the biosuccinic acid that companies were aware of was technical grade - that is to say that it was suitable for use in manufacturing chemicals but not ideal for food or pharmaceutical use. Respondents saw an unsatisfied requirement for biosuccinic acid manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice - GMP. This is an approach to manufacturing that provides for systematic quality assurance and traceability and labelling systems to ensure that products are suitable for human consumption.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>966B1B1D-606A-4BDC-9CCB-DCFAAA415EBE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56e08c93ae8a38.85729731</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Provided are methods for generating a microorganism with improved ability to convert glycerol to succinic acid.

Our idea comprises a number of innovations, which have been filed in recent patent applications: 
? Generation of a strain of A. succinogenes with improved ability to convert glycerol to SA. 
? An optimised fermentation methodology, producing SA from crude glycerol with high yield and high final concentrations as well as low co-product formation. 
? Validated predictive computational models of the bioprocess including the bioconversion of both substrates involved (crude glycerol and CO2) for process optimisation and design purposes. 
? An holistic computational model of the integrated biorefinery co-producing biodiesel and succinic acid to assess the economic and environmental feasibility. This also allows us to efficiently design the downstream process and to assess potential alternative options.
