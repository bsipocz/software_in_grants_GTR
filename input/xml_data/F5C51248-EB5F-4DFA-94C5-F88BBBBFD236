Britain's experience of ruins in this period was highly distinctive, however, defined less by Roman ruins than by the Roman Catholic ruins of the 650 abbeys suppressed during the English Reformation in the 1530s. The Dissolution of the Monasteries was the defining event for representations of ruins in English literature, its significance reflected in the titles of later works like Austen's 'Northanger Abbey' (1798-9) and Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey' (1798). Yet while ruins are widely acknowledged as an important motif in Gothic and Romantic literatures, their significance for our understanding of English Renaissance literature has been largely overlooked. There has been some critical recognition of ruins in writing by Spenser and Shakespeare, but no book-length study charting their significance in literature across the early modern period. 

This project offers an in-depth assessment of this underexplored topic, investigating how and why ruins were represented in English Renaissance literature within the long century following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s. While it acknowledges the influence on English literature of French and Italian models for representing Roman ruins, it also argues for the distinctiveness of England's experience of the protestant Reformation and its impact on English literary representations of ruins. Critics have argued that ruins in English Renaissance literature reflect the antiquarian interests of this period. But ruins were more than a window onto the past; they were also a mirror reflecting the future fate of the present, their fragility a reminder of the decline and fall of civilisations. It is as a comment on the vanity of early modern imperial endeavour that the French Renaissance poet Joachim Du Bellay read the ruins of Rome's past in the mid-sixteenth century, and in this project I trace the translation of this perspective to the particular context of protestant England and its own self-image as an empire in the early modern period. In ruins, the project reads a radical undercurrent in English Renaissance writing that questions and critiques the constructs of empire it appears to support. The project brings this approach to ruins into dialogue with current critical debates about the mechanics of British state-formation under the Tudors and Stuarts, arguing against a stream of recent criticism that sees English Renaissance literature as largely supportive of England's imperial ambitions over Britain and Ireland. Its findings will make a significant contribution to our knowledge and understanding of both English literature and English identity, its focus on ruins revealing sites of resistance in literature to England's imperial ideology in the early modern period. 

The project will be based at the University of Hull, where the Andrew Marvell Centre offers an established framework for interdisciplinary research in the medieval and early modern periods, and where significant archival resources on Marvell are housed at the Hull History Centre. Marvell is a poet and politician with lifelong connections to Hull, and his relationship to the medieval monastic ruins of Hull and Yorkshire is a key focus for the project. Alongside the monograph 'Renaissance literatures of ruin: Spenser to Marvell', the project's findings will be disseminated through a journal article, conference paper and academic conference on Marvell, and through a school session, public lecture and the public exhibition 'Marvell and medieval Hull', produced in partnership with the Hull History Centre, and in collaboration with the leading Marvell expert, Professor Nigel Smith (Princeton).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Andrew Marvell is a major poet and political figure with particular connections to Hull. Working in partnership with the Hull History Centre, the project's impact activities will engage schools, media organisations and local, national and international publics with my research on Marvell and medieval ruins. The History Centre is a particularly appropriate partner for the proposed impact activities, as the new home for Hull's extensive archives on Marvell. The History Centre offers a calendar of local history events and exhibitions, and I plan to contribute the following in 2015:
 
1) A public exhibition at the History Centre entitled 'Marvell and medieval Hull', organised with the leading Marvell expert, Professor Nigel Smith (Princeton). 
2) A public lecture on the research behind the exhibition, delivered within the History Centre's 'Lunchtime Club' series, which attracts audience figures of 50-100. 
3) A session on 'Marvell's Hull' for schools studying Marvell in the Key Stage 4 (KS4) English curriculum, delivered within the History Centre's existing programme of 'Led Sessions for Schools'. 
 
The 'Lunchtime Club' lecture and school session will complement the exhibition, tailoring its research findings to the needs of specific non-academic audiences. The three activities will engage the following beneficiaries:

1. The Hull History Centre, a third sector organisation with a mission to widen public accessibility to its archival resources. The three impact activities are expressly designed to engage wider publics with my own research and, through this, with the resources of the Centre. 

2. Local communities. Housed in the History Centre's entrance arcade, the exhibition will be aimed at all visitors to the Centre, which attracts a footfall of schools, families, and wider publics with interests in regional history, as well as academics and university students. My 'Lunchtime Club' lecture forms part of a public forum for local history at the Centre, and those attending my talk will also be encouraged to visit the exhibition. 

3. The media. The exhibition will be widely publicised online and on social media. I will be encouraging local media coverage by inviting journalists from BBC Radio Humberside, the Hull Daily Mail, and other media organisations to attend a launch event for the exhibition in October 2015. I also aim to maximise the exhibition's potential reach by seeking to attract national media interest in its unique focus on Marvell's medieval inheritance. I will be approaching my existing contacts with journalists at BBC Radio 4's 'The Long View' to propose ideas for an episode of the programme based around the project's research on Marvell. My collaborator, Professor Nigel Smith, will also be using his existing media contacts at BBC Radios 3 and 4 to help attract national media coverage of the exhibition. 

4. Local schools. My school session on 'Marvell's Hull' will use documents in the History Centre archives to engage with and extend the study of Marvell at KS4, focusing on the medieval heritage of the city he grew up in. It will be publicised to schools in Hull and Humberside via the History Centre's marketing channels, and I will also be using the University Access Office's existing network of school contacts to discuss requirements for the session with school teachers directly. 

5. National and international audiences. The exhibition will cast an important new light on a major poet, and I aim to attract visitors from outside the Hull region to the exhibition and/or its website through a campaign of marketing online and on social media, alongside efforts to attract national media coverage, as discussed above. I am also discussing the possibility with Professor Smith of displaying the exhibition in future at Princeton University. The exhibition's catalogue and display boards will thereafter be deposited in the History Centre's archives to form a permanent, public legacy for the exhibition.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84694</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hull History Centre, Worship Street, Hull</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Andrew Marvell: Made in Hull</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F4DB73F-96EA-46E6-86FE-2E211272BD79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- The free public exhibition Andrew Marvell: Made in Hull.

The partnership built on the popularity of HullCraft [http://www.hullcraft.com], a collaborative initiative between the Hull History Centre and the University of Hull launched in August 2014. HullCraft uses Minecraft to virtually recreate historical buildings from plans, maps and other material in the Hull History Centre's archives, through a series of interactive workshops aimed at young people and drawing on technical expertise in Minecraft at the University of Hull's Learning Enhancement Unit. The 'Rebuilding Marvell's Hull with Minecraft' partnership extended the HullCraft concept to archival material in the Hull History Centre directly relating to my AHRC research. We held an interactive workshop for young people at the Hull History Centre on 21 November 2015, supported by a successful bid for &amp;pound;1795 of funding from 'Being Human: A Festival of the Humanities 2015' (organised by the School of Advanced Studies, University of London). My contribution to the partnership was to collaborate with the Hull History Centre on the planning, promotion and delivery of the 'Rebuilding Marvell's Hull with Minecraft' workshop. My research was the inspiration for the workshop, and I selected and sourced the archival material that was used to promote and deliver the event.

My role in the broadcast was to discuss the poem in the context of my AHRC research project. Research on the ruins represented in Marvell's poem has been central to the AHRC project and is reflected in several other outputs reported on here (the public exhibition, 'Andrew Marvell: Made in Hull'; the monograph, 'Ruin and Reformation in Spenser, Shakespeare and Marvell'). After the broadcast, I received two emails from members of the public, one of whom had been inspired by our programme to visit the local village church where we began our walk, and to explore the Marvell connections that I emphasised in the broadcast. This listener also noted that 'Something should be done - perhaps you are the person already doing it - to open up the location(s) for the sort of literary pilgrimage accorded to so many others across the country'.

 Regional impact: The project's two public talks (University of Hull, February 2015 and Hull History Centre, January 2016) attracted audiences of 69 and 87 attendees respectively. The feedback response rate was 47% and 74%, with 35% and 66% of these respondents reporting changing attitudes towards the topic as a result of these talks. 70% of the 47 respondents to feedback requests from visitors to the public exhibition ('Andrew Marvell: Made in Hull', Hull History Centre, autumn 2015) reported similar shifts in attitudes. Nine feedback forms were received from the eighteen under-12s who attended the Marvell and Minecraft workshop in November 2015 (50% response rate). Of these, five were 'amazed' by the process of rebuilding historic Hull, while two commented that they had learnt something new about Hull's history. 

 These events have also increased footfall at the Hull History Centre, and helped raise awareness of the cultural importance of its archives. Further engagement activities promoting the Centre's Marvell archives are being planned with the History Centre for the Hull City of Culture 2017 events programme. The display boards from the exhibition are currently being digitized for publication online, while research for the exhibition is directly informing the creation at the University of Hull of a digital map of Hull's literary landmarks, to be made available as a freely downloadable app. 

 National impact: Participation in a special episode on Andrew Marvell for BBC Radio 4's 'Ramblings' (first broadcast 8 October 2015) helped disseminate my research findings to a national audience of 1.4 million listeners, and I received two emails from listeners on topics directly relating to my discussion of Marvell in the broadcast. The presenter of 'Ramblings', Clare Balding, tweeted information about the episode to her 600k followers, and my own Twitter account (@RenRuins) has been used throughout the project to promote this and other engagement activities (currently 240 followers, of which 29% are from countries outside the UK). The Marvell and Minecraft workshop was promoted nationally as part of 'Being Human 2015', a UK-wide festival of the humanities. The Marvell and Minecraft event was previewed in the national newspaper, 'The Observer', on 8 November 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E6EE6EDF-2A67-477A-95A6-87EB53ACE190</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d6f37513e631.83963120</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has investigated the legacy of religious ruins in English Renaissance literature, asking how and why the religious violence of England's long Reformation (1520-1688) left its mark on literature, from the establishment of the English national church under Henry VIII in the 1530s to its disestablishment under Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s. Between these dates, England experienced a wave of religious violence against abbeys, churches, and cathedrals. The social, economic, and cultural impact of this period of Protestant iconoclasm has been well documented by historians, but studies of its literary impact have been largely confined to Shakespeare's writing. Redressing this, the project has applied to English literature the research methods of historians committed to a long view of the Reformation as a protracted and uneven process spanning 150 years of British-Irish history. The project has been the first to chart the literary legacy of Reformation ruins over a broad historical timeframe, and across a range of English literature by key authors including Spenser, Shakespeare, and Marvell.

 The project has emphasized the need for a fuller understanding of how writers like Spenser, Shakespeare, and Marvell saw the ruins of medieval monasteries, not just as trophies of England's Protestant triumph over Catholicism, or icons of traditionalist nostalgia for Catholicism's loss, but as sites for authorial introspection on an English church and nation whose Protestant, imperialist destiny was by no means as self-evident to Renaissance writers as conventional criticism suggests. Its findings have therefore highlighted a key role for monastic ruins within and beyond their representation in English literature, arguing for the influence of these literary representations of ruins in cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of identity - regional, national, and religious - in post-Reformation England and Wales. 

 Two key publications are forthcoming: the 100,000-word monograph 'Ruin and Reformation in Spenser, Shakespeare and Marvell' (completed and forthcoming) and the 10,000-word journal article 'From Swords to Ploughshares: Planting religion in Spenser's A View of the State of Ireland (1633)' (under review). Several conference papers and a bibliographical reference work on Andrew Marvell (forthcoming with 'Oxford Bibliographies') have also been achieved. 

 Public engagement activities have focused on the role of religious ruins in writing by the Hull poet and politician, Andrew Marvell (1621-78), and this has led to partnerships with the Hull History Centre, the venue for my public exhibition 'Andrew Marvell: Made in Hull' (November 2015-January 2016) and a public talk on research behind the exhibition in January 2016. An earlier public talk on Marvell and Hull took place at the University of Hull in February 2015. I also collaborated with the Hull History Centre on a successful bid for funding from 'Being Human 2015: A Festival of the Humanities', which supported delivery of an interactive workshop for school-aged children inspired by my research - 'Rebuilding Marvell's Hull with Minecraft'. The same research informed my discussion of Marvell's poem, 'Upon Appleton House', for a special episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme, 'Ramblings', first broadcast in October 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Positive reviews of my monograph by readers for Oxford University Press have opened up further pathways to academic impact. Since its review, I have been invited to present research at the AHRC 'Remembering the Reformation' workshop in October 2016, and to contribute to the project's planned research outcomes. I have also accepted invitations to contribute articles on Marvell for two special journal issues. I have contributed a non-academic article on Marvell's Hull for the 'Hull: Culture, History, Place' volume of the 'British Historic Towns Atlas' (2017), and I am organising a range of Marvell events as joint lead for the interdisciplinary 'Reading the Ridings' project for Hull City of Culture 2017 - a series of talks, exhibitions, and poetry readings which works to promote public engagement with Hull writers, and to explore how Hull writing contributes to perceptions of the city among audience members at our events. Adopting a social science methodology, we are recording audience-led discussion and debates, which recordings will then be transcribed to serve as tools for analysing the social impact of our engagement with a range of Hull writers. The displays from the AHRC Marvell: Made in Hull exhibition (autumn 2015) are also in the process of being digitized to form part of the Google Cultural Insitute, ensuring a permanent, public online legacy. 
 
 Research for the Marvell exhibition, workshop and public talks drew attention to the influence on Marvell of his father's ecclesiastical career, highlighting the particular significance of Marvell's father's 'sermon book' (Hull History Centre). Planned activities will encourage greater engagement with this manuscript miscellany, and I am working to create partnerships with the History Centre, the British Library, and BBC Radio to deliver a range of engagement activities for academic and non-academic audiences in 2017 and beyond.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>71D410FC-35B9-4ED2-9EB3-3B21936CD519</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6f2f2540a39.77154207</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/english/our-staff/mottram,-dr-stewart.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B056546E-F9C0-4A2A-8EB1-887EC4923428</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hull: Culture, History, Place</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c3a9dfb9cf754c9983c7c19e22f1e687"><gtr:id>c3a9dfb9cf754c9983c7c19e22f1e687</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mottram S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-78138-419-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58b988f2911ff0.20292162</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD191326-55E9-403F-BBE7-FEFFF825894E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Weeding England's other Eden: Richard II, the 1649 regicide, and Marvell's &amp;quot;Upon Appleton House&amp;quot;
