A &amp;quot;Robot Scientist&amp;quot; is a physically implemented laboratory automation system that exploits techniques from the field of artificial intelligence to execute cycles of scientific experimentation. Our vision is that within 10 years many scientific discoveries will be made by teams of human and robot scientists, and that such collaborations between human and robot scientists will produce scientific knowledge more efficiently than either could alone. In this way the productivity of science will be increased, leading to societal benefits: better food security, better medicines, etc. The Physics Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek has predicted that the best scientist in one hundred years time will be a machine. The proposed project aims to take that prediction several steps closer.

We will develop the AdaLab (an Adaptive Automated Scientific Laboratory) framework for semi-automated and automated knowledge discovery by teams of human and robot scientists. This framework will integrate and advance a number of ICT methodologies: knowledge representation, ontology engineering, semantic technologies, machine learning, bioinformatics, and automated experimentation (robot scientists). We will evaluate the AdaLab framework on an important real-world application in cell biology with biomedical relevance to cancer and ageing. The core of AdaLab will be generic.

The expected project outputs include:

- An AdaLab demonstrated to be greater than 20% more efficient at discovering scientific knowledge (within a limited scientific domain) than human scientists alone.
- A novel ontology for modelling uncertain knowledge that supports all aspects of the proposed AdaLab framework.
- The first ever communication mechanism between human and robot scientists that standardises modes of communication, information exchange protocols, and the content of typical messages. 
- New machine learning methods for the generation and efficient testing of complex scientific hypotheses that are twice as efficient at selecting experiments as the best current methods.
- A significant advance in the state-of-the-art in automating scientific discovery that demonstrates its scalability to problems an order of magnitude more complex than currently possible.
- Novel biomedical knowledge about cell biology relevant to cancer and ageing.
 - A strengthened interdisciplinary research community that crosses the boundaries between multiple ICT disciplines, laboratory automation, and biology.

All outputs produced by the project will be made publicly available by the end of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project has high potential for significant technological, economical, and societal impacts. This potential impact of robot scientists has been widely recognised, e.g. in the Nature editorial of 15.1.04 their potential synergistic collaboration with human scientists is stressed, &amp;quot;an automated system that designs its own experiments will benefit young molecular geneticists&amp;quot;; a reviewer of our article in Science (King et al, 2009) stated that the work was of &amp;quot;historical significance&amp;quot;; and Time magazine named it the 4th most significant scientific advance of 2009. The proposed project principally extends the previous work by developing a (semi-) automated framework for scientific discoveries by teams of human and robot scientists (AdaLab), making it far more applicable to general biomedical research. 

The AdaLab framework will contribute to realising Europe's 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The project would contribute to the future development of (semi)-automated laboratories across Europe and wider. These intelligent laboratories have the potential to speed up the technological progress. Our cautious estimate is that the exploitation of the AdaLab framework in scientific laboratories would increase the efficiency of laboratory experimentation by 20% (see section 2). Such an increase would lead to more scientific discoveries, better technological solutions, and new products. 

Science is the greatest generator of economic wealth (through developments in technology), and the greatest driver of better health (through development in biomedical science). Therefore all EU citizens will potentially benefit from the proposed research. For example new better drugs could be delivered to the market faster and cheaper. Currently, ~25Billion euros is spent annually within the EU on pharmaceutical research. Most of this is spent on late-stage trials (which are less amenable to automation), but conservatively estimating that 10% is amenable to the AdaLab framework, then a 20% efficiency gain would result in savings of ~0.5Billion euros per annum.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>361018</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Museum Antenna Live Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B0997B9-4C5C-4251-A1C9-65772BA62612</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We presented the Robot Scientist and discussed the types of experiments it was capable of undertaking, within the framework of 'how to think like a scientist'. We also had an interactive (computer simulation) demonstration of drug design in which visitors could ascertain what features of a compound rendered it as a 'good' or a 'bad' drug. Both activities provoked significant interest and enthusiasm from members of the public of all ages, from 8 to 80! The robot itself sparked more general discussion about the potential uses of a robot scientist, as well as the technicalities of how it operates, whereas the computer simulated demonstration enabled those who took part to think about the characteristics looked for in drug design, which also generated much discussion. Visitor records to this specific exhibit recorded more than 3500 visitors either 'spectating' or actually 'engaging' with the scientists presenting the robot.

We anticipate that impact from this event will be long-term and on-going. For example, the event will certainly have increased public awareness as to what a Robot Scientist is capable of (i.e. it is more than just a technical operator, but is also capable of thinking like a human scientist), and we saw evidence of increased discussion around this subject between friends and families. We also anticipate increased interest in STEM subjects at secondary and higher education levels, given the curios</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>561e6f1826eb80.00763165</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMIcMrzDgNc</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with Prof. King featured on Belgian television</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A7BE086-48F3-4213-B11B-CC6AFA1867B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof. King, the Scientific Leader of the AdaLab project, was interviewed by Ann Dooms from the Belgian public television channel 'Canvas' (www.canvas.be) for a documentary about the life of Alan Turing.

The BU contribution to AdaLab is mainly within Workpackage 2, that is, it is concerned with Knowledge Representation. Workpackage 2 aims to develop formal machine processable representations of the relevant data and knowledge in the project, to support machine learning, modelling, and probabilistic reasoning with uncertain knowledge.

The following formal representations, in the form of ontologies, have been produced to support the project (a deliverable report, D2.1, is available on request):
? P-ontology provides annotation labels for capturing uncertainties, e.g. uncertainties about models and its parts, uncertainties about experimental results.
? Meta-data ontology is for the description of the datasets and models. It enables capturing information about provenance, quality and key characteristics of datasets and models.
? AdaLab ontology models biological entities relevant to the project.

An initial version of a knowledge base about yeast diauxic shift has been produced under the leadership of Dr Elati, University of &amp;Eacute;vry-Val-d'Essonne (a partner on the AdaLab project). This incorporates knowledge from the relevant to the project datasets and models (a deliverable report, D2.2, describing the KB is available on request).

An initial version of a communication mechanism between human and robot scientists has been developed (a deliverable report, D2.3, is available on request).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are developing a model for future laboratory based science.

In this way the productivity of science will be increased, which in turn will lead to societal benefits.

A sustainability plan has been generated, describing the potential for the use of the AdaLab system (as well as its individual components) beyond the formal end of the project. This can be found in Deliverable Report no. 5.2 (available on request). The main outcome of the project will be the integrated AdaLab system, which will comprise all of the project's results working as a cohesive workflow to perform experiments, evaluate and analyse results and plan future experiments based on these results. In addition to this, there are several individual components of the system which have the potential to be used by the wider scientific community after the project has ended. These include:
? The machine learnt models of yeast behaviour and diauxic shift,
? The machine learnt models for selecting new experiments to conduct,
? The AdaLab ontologies,
? The database of yeast growth data produced within the project,
? Communication mechanisms between robot and human scientists,
? Various smaller bits of software developed during the AdaLab project,
? A compendium of relevant literature and datasets to be fully accessible by the scientific community.

Specifically, several software components are planned to be released by the end of the project, for example, in the form of R packages for Workpackage 4; these are currently available as intermediate versions, under GIT repositories (https://bitbucket.org/alexandros_sarafianos/adalab). These include CoRegFlux, an R Bioconductor package for metabolic simulations using gene expression and regulator influence that will be released with an accompanying publication.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C8F96DDB-B9D2-441A-9AE5-A5FEA4621583</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d572b049cd49.46721674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E83A5CD-F852-4C6C-AC38-E00BED0F3F42</gtr:id><gtr:title>SBOL Visual: A Graphical Language for Genetic Designs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c961cd8d0a262ae9dec0799bd73b292"><gtr:id>9c961cd8d0a262ae9dec0799bd73b292</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Quinn JY</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1544-9173</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d56dc07db256.43434256</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C013BC98-74CE-4F9E-AE6C-5F78252B0E21</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f76c1de284d527f45c47ca604d35a2c8"><gtr:id>f76c1de284d527f45c47ca604d35a2c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bandrowski A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d4c45343649.27834027</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3764367B-763C-4E1A-B29D-11D75B4DC700</gtr:id><gtr:title>Generic ontology of datatypes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Information Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/59eb9187078ec16ee94924e5e5a8c1d7"><gtr:id>59eb9187078ec16ee94924e5e5a8c1d7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Panov P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d578f4864098.98420571</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7A07F3B9-E1FA-4B09-A682-A1A2A2A8E997</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cheaper faster drug development validated by the repositioning of drugs against neglected tropical diseases.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c06da4926bbf05c100ed251f0d7ec1fa"><gtr:id>c06da4926bbf05c100ed251f0d7ec1fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-5662</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56153685e10022.89697875</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M015661/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>85</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
