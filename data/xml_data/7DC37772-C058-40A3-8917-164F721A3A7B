However, our knowledge of these neuronal networks is very limited. In order to design treatments for paralysing injuries or diseases of the spinal cord, we need to gain a better understanding of the networks of spinal neurons that control movement. This initially requires the identification of neurons which make up these networks. Following their identification we need to study the individual properties of these neurons and how it is that they connect to each other to produce the activity which controls movement. The proposed study aims to provide some of this critical information. Molecular techniques will be used to identify specific populations of neurons in the spinal cord. Using these techniques we will be able to concentrate on 'last order interneurons' which communicate directly with the neurons that send the final message to muscles to contract (motoneurons). Following their identification, last order interneurons will be studied during locomotor activity in isolated preparations of the spinal cord obtained from mice. This will enable us to investigate the roles that specific groups of last order interneurons play in the production of locomotor activity. As outlined above this information is critical toward our understanding of the neural control of movement and ultimately towards the design of treatment strategies for injury or disease which affects the spinal cord.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Despite nearly a century of research since the discovery that the isolated spinal cord can generate locomotion, the neuronal networks underlying such motor behaviour remain poorly understood. However, with the advent of new molecular labelling techniques and physiological preparations allowing the study of locomotor activity in vitro, it is now possible to identify and study components of these networks. Using such techniques the proposed study aims to identify last order interneurons of the spinal cord and elucidate their specific roles in locomotion. Last order interneurons will be identified using a pseudo rabies virus which contains the eGFP construct. The virus will be injected into the hind limb muscles of neonatal mice to retrogradely infect motoneurons and last order interneurons and label them with eGFP. We will concentrate on cholinergic last order interneurons which supply abundant C bouton inputs to motoneurons. Recent evidence suggests that these inputs play an important modulatory role, increasing motoneuron excitability so that appropriate motor output is produced during locomotion. Initially, anatomical analyses will identify cholinergic last order interneurons immunohistochemically. Utilising juxtacellular filling techniques in isolated in vitro spinal cord preparations the axonal projections of cholinergic last order interneurons will then be determined. Next, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings will be performed in spinal cord slice preparations to investigate the intrinsic properties of cholinergic last order interneurons. Finally, simultaneous electroneurographic recordings from ventral roots and paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of interneurons and motoneurons will be performed in isolated spinal cord preparations which can elicit fictive locomotion in vitro. These experiments will determine the activity pattern of cholinergic last order interneurons during fictive locomotion, and their effects on motoneurons during fictive locomotion.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>363848</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Columbia University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof Tom Jessell</gtr:description><gtr:id>6BBF9780-F447-4F85-B165-AAC8B2106B37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PMID: 20005822</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463982a4bd824.51859654-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborator has contributed their expertise in molecular genetics and spinal cord development and has also provided us with genetically modified animals for our research.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have provided our expertise in electrophysiology and knowledge of spinal cord physiology to the collaboration.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>149823</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Project grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Scotland</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>385B0FF6-BDC9-402E-9D28-750742ADA033</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546398da648f13.04287293</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Walking is initiated by relatively simple 'start' signals which are relayed from the brain to the spinal cord. Networks of neurons in the spinal cord, called central pattern generators, are then responsible for controlling the complex pattern of
muscle contractions which allow us to walk. The identities and properties of the neurons in the spinal cord which control movement and the connections they form with each other are, however, poorly understood. We have long known that a
major type of spinal neuron, called the motor neuron, sends signals directly to muscles to make them contract. The research performed in this project aimed to decipher the properties, connections and functional roles of another class
of spinal neurons, termed interneurons, which are also involved in controlling movement. Using state-of-the-art genetic, anatomical and electrophysiological techniques, we defined a new type of interneuron that connects directly to motor neurons to control the strength of the signals that motor neurons send to muscles. Importantly, this connection allows the strength of muscle contractions to be adjusted to suit different types of movements and different environments. This novel class of spinal interneuron may form an important new target for therapies aimed at treating conditions such as Motor Neuron Disease and Spinal Cord Injury where muscle weakness or paralysis occurs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are likely to direct the work of many other researchers aiming to understand how neuromodulatory systems, not just of the spinal cord but throughout the central nervous system, control the activity of neural networks and ultimately behaviour. Our findings also highlight a discrete neuromodulatory system within the mammalian spinal cord which could be targeted by both academic and industrial researchers aiming to design novel therapeutics to help increase motor output in conditions which involve loss of muscle function. As a testament to the impact of our work, one of the publications that arose from our project (Zagoraiou et al., Neuron, 2009) has been cited over 200 times (Google Scholar, Feb, 16).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2C70C0DF-9171-4DD4-8070-2170A273349C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447c7ca20baf6.82607206</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8F2B87E0-ED6C-40BD-9ED8-521F3A65BB15</gtr:id><gtr:title>Glial-derived adenosine modulates spinal motor networks in mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neurophysiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f8b17c5267d589a6d646d04561f13557"><gtr:id>f8b17c5267d589a6d646d04561f13557</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Witts EC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3077</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f94a94abf045be</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>255B0DFF-9057-4943-AF38-86279BC2A906</gtr:id><gtr:title>A cluster of cholinergic premotor interneurons modulates mouse locomotor activity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neuron</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bbec2df024c413a678937f0ddad6f958"><gtr:id>bbec2df024c413a678937f0ddad6f958</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zagoraiou L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0896-6273</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5447cc8d3a5e16.07500123</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D878F6E0-2544-4561-A2D4-89006430836B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors modulates locomotor-related motoneuron output in mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neurophysiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/81f7f19853de2b279be59eccb87c1205"><gtr:id>81f7f19853de2b279be59eccb87c1205</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Iwagaki N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3077</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5447cbdcd2bb78.11630791</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E019803/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
