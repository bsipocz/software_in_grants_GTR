Although CIs can provide excellent speech perception in quiet environments, current devices are very poor at conveying pitch information and therefore many CI users express dissatisfaction when listening to music through their implant.\n\nMusic is ubiquitous in all cultures. It is an effective means of expression and communication and can promote social inclusion. It can arouse and pacify, having an extraordinarily powerful effect on the emotions. The importance of music for well being and quality of life is reflected by the fact that researchers and CI manufacturers are increasingly turning their attention towards developing CI processing strategies aimed at providing better cues for music perception.\n\nThrough a unique series of composition workshops this project will explore aspects of music that can be appreciated by CI users. It is anticipated that, through the creative process of composition, adult CI users will gain a better understanding of specific music styles and structures that can readily be appreciated and enjoyed through a CI. This knowledge will be used guide the development of music rehabilitation materials and compositions specifically for CI users. The impact of the composition workshops and rehabilitation materials on the music perception ability and satisfaction of CI users will also be evaluated. The project will conclude with public seminars on cochlear implant technology and the process of composing for and with CI users, followed by performances of the compositions.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>- User groups\nThe composition workshops and trials of the (re)habilitation materials will be advertised to all adult CI users at the South of England Cochlear Implant Centre (SOECIC) within the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research. The SOECIC provides assessments, training, care and support for about 100 patients per year. During the ten years this centre has been running, over 500 patients have been implanted. \nCI users participating in the music composition workshops will receive training and support in composition in a friendly environment where they will be able to meet with other CI users and exchange experiences. Through these sessions CI users will be encouraged to explore music styles and structures in order to gain a better understanding of aspects of music that can be readily appreciated. It is anticipated that this creative process will contribute to the well-being, quality of life and feeling of social inclusion for these individuals. \nThe rehabilitation materials developed in this research project will be distributed as self-help tools for enhancing music perception ability and satisfaction through a CI. CI users worldwide could potentially benefit, leading to an improvement in well-being and quality of life for this population. To ensure that CI users will benefit from the rehabilitation materials (following evaluation and further development) time and resources have been allocated for the production and distribution of the materials within the SOECIC and to other CI centres in the UK. These materials will also be promoted by The Ear Foundation (see letter of support) and will be made available online to ensure that they are disseminated as widely as possible. \n\n- Service providers\nCochlear implant centres (including the SOECIC) and charities for the deaf (e.g. The Ear Foundation, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) and Deafness Research UK) will in turn benefit from this research project in being able to offer more services to adult implantees through the provision of fully evaluated music (re)habilitation materials and guidance.\nCochlear implant manufacturers will potentially gain from this research project through knowledge concerning the music perception abilities of CI users for various device types and the potential of music (re)habilitation materials.\nThe findings of this research are likely to guide the provision of music (re)habilitation schemes by local education services, care providers and community music schemes such as the Southampton Community (SoCo) Music Project. The findings will also inform the practice of music therapists. The findings of this research will be communicated to these audiences through dissemination in appropriate peer reviewed journals and at conferences, as well as through the direct involvement of the SoCo Music Project and a practising music therapist. \n\n- Public awareness and engagement\nIn order to promote public engagement with hearing science and music, the research project will conclude with a public seminar and performance of audiovisual compositions developed during the project. This event will be advertised to the local community through the web and local media, to CI users at the SOECIC through the web and patient newsletter, and to CI user groups across the UK. \n\n- Outreach to schools\nAudiovisual material developed during the course of this project will form part of an interactive workshop to be piloted at the National Science and Engineering Week March 2012, University of Southampton. This event will be aimed at people of all ages. In the same week, 'lectures-in-a-box' will be piloted in schools to pupils at key-stages 2, 3 to 4 and 5. Feedback from these lectures will be used to revise the materials and further lectures will be given in schools towards the end of the project. These will be designed to inspire and engage pupils in</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>109080</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>One of a series of new works specifically designed for cochlear implant users.

This has received a total of 1481 views (as of Tuesday 21st October 2014) since their upload in December 2012.

The IMAP was further developed as an online resource in 2014 and is available at: www.morefrommusic.org. The IMAP is currently being used by over 200 cochlear implant users, hearing aid users and professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5EA669DF-685C-4FB7-9ED2-06555C87624C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545bb1c9401e02.81377875</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research objectives for this project were to
1. To explore aspects of music composition that can be appreciated by cochlear implant (CI) users
2. To investigate the therapeutic value of music composition activities for CI users
3. To develop (re)habilitation materials to aid music appreciation for CI users
4. To evaluate the effectiveness of these (re)habilitation materials

Objectives 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3 were met through consultation meetings and a unique series of nine music workshops, which were run between February and June 2011 to 1) explore the abilities, needs and desires of CI users, 2) develop ideas and prototype software for inclusion in a music (re)habilitation programme and 3) raise awareness of strategies and resources for improving access to music. The therapeutic value of music workshops was concurrently investigated. Twenty-eight adult CI users from the South of England Cochlear Implant Centre attended at least one of the workshops. Participants could attend as many workshops as they wished. Each workshop lasted between 2 to 2.5 hours and included individual computer-based and group activities. A pre-workshop survey was used to determine attendees' aspirations and expectations. Post-workshop surveys were used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate attendees' immediate reactions to the workshop content, software, and perceived benefits. An additional two-month post-workshop survey evaluated the longer-term impact of the workshops. KEY FINDINGS: Overall reaction to the music workshops and prototype software was positive. All attendees indicated that they anticipated changing how they engaged with music as a result of the workshops, and data from the pre and two-month post workshop surveys suggest a positive change in listening habits. Music workshops proved to be an effective means of simultaneously encouraging music exploration in a social and safe environment and obtaining feedback on prototype rehabilitation materials. Survey data suggested that through group listening and practical activities certain aspects of music can be accessible and rewarding through a CI, leading to positive changes in attitude and behaviour towards music. 
Objective 4 was met through a randomised controlled crossover trial of a music rehabilitation programme called the 'Interactive Music Awareness Programme' (IMAP). The IMAP developed with feedback from CI users in a series of consultations and music workshops. Twenty-one participants were recruited to take part in the trial. The treatment group received the IMAP first, followed by a 12-week 'retention of learning' phase. The control group received the IMAP after a period of 12 weeks. The IMAP comprised 24 x 30 minute computer-based sessions to be completed over a period of 12 weeks. Both groups were required to attend three 2-hour music perception assessment appointments at the start, half-way through and at the end of the trial. Sixteen participants completed the training and attended all three music perception assessment appointments. Primary outcome measures included melodic contour identification (MCI), instrument recognition, music appraisal and speech perception in noise. Participants also provided qualitative information regarding how often they used the IMAP, how long for, good/bad features of the IMAP and observations regarding their ability/progress. KEY FINDINGS: Both groups showed an increase in instrument recognition following the 12 week period in which they used the IMAP. In addition, the treatment group showed an increase in performance for MCI and gave higher music appraisal ratings. It was not possible to observe an increase in MCI for the control group due to ceiling effects. Overall, the data suggest that the IMAP has a positive effect on particular aspects of music perception. Qualitative feedback from the trial was used to further develop and refine the IMAP before launching it as a web resource in January 2014. Since its launch, over 200 individuals have registered to use the IMAP; approximately half of these are CI users and half are professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The 'Interactive Music Awareness Programme' (IMAP) was developed in response to the needs of adult cochlear implant (CI) users. The current version is available online at www.morefrommusic.org with applications available for download that enable users to access music by creating, manipulating and playing with music in open-ended ways. Support for further development and maintenance of the IMAP is currently being discussed with CI manufacturers. 

Whilst the 'target audience' of this project was severely or profoundly deaf people who use a CI, the online resource is likely to appeal to the hearing impaired population in general. Other music therapy client groups may additionally benefit from the software applications in the IMAP, including those with autistic spectrum/communication disorders, emotional/behavioural disturbance, mental illness, and learning and physical disabilities. Further studies could investigate how and when users engage with the IMAP.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8FDFC845-6A0B-4DAF-8059-3BEC78E63BC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5726586818.44043377609156</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mfg/current_projects/compositions.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Music workshops for adult cochlear implant users: a good practice guide</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>86172A46-6781-4659-A48C-8032DF021F63</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b89fc4bdc37.98823573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mfg/music_info/professionals.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the IMAP is to aid music appreciation and it was developed using a participatory design approach with adult cochlear implant (CI) users from the University of Southampton Auditory Implant Service and members of the UK National Cochlear Implant Users Association.

CIs can enable severely or profoundly deaf people to perceive sounds and understand speech. However, current devices are very poor at conveying pitch information and therefore, although many CI express a desire to hear music again, many are dissatisfied with the way music sounds through their implant.

The IMAP has 24 sessions that link to stand alone applications, which enable users to create and manipulate music. The applications are introduced using written and subtitled video instructions, and each session ends with either a test or directed listening task. Users can also comment on the IMAP in a forum and give feedback.</gtr:description><gtr:id>14C7AC8F-DE8C-45BF-A997-86745E603E18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The IMAP is currently being used by over 130 cochlear implant users, hearing aid users and professionals.
