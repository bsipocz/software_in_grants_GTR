&lt;p>Previous research in this area has often focused on intentional communities, such as communes, rather than other forms of co-residence which are both rather more 'ordinary' and, in some cases, much more widespread. Accordingly, this research focuses on shared households, private lodging arrangements, small housing cooperatives, and cohousing projects (resident-controlled developments combining private dwellings with shared facilities), and will explore the intersections of four distinctive aspects of communal living - economic, spatial, temporal and ideological - in each of these contexts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 80 individuals living in communal contexts (20 per type), exploring their housing histories and their current living arrangements. The allocation and use of physical space will be explored using spatial mapping techniques, and three further methods - object inventories, time-use diaries, and network mapping - involving targeted sub-samples of participants will explore the use of 'communal' versus 'private' material resources, the use of shared time in communal contexts, and the impact of living communally on the nature of residents? personal networks.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate that our research will be of interest to a diverse range of non-academic end-users:

- Organisations representing, and advocating for, cohousing and housing co-ops, eg Radical Routes, Cooperatives UK, The Confederation of Co-operative Housing, the UK Cohousing Network, and Diggers and Dreamers;
- Commercial organisations promoting shared households and private lodgings, eg national companies such as SpareRoom.co.uk and its affiliates, and local companies, eg Manchester-based 'Ideal House Share';
- Organisations representing the interests of landlords, eg the National Landlords Association and the Residential Landlords Association;
- Central and local government bodies, eg the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Homes and Communities Agency; 
- Third sector organisations, eg the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, AGE UK, and the National Housing Federation (which represents English Housing Associations); 
- Professional bodies, eg the Chartered Institute of Housing;
- The general public and popular media.

The potential benefits of the research will vary for each of these groups, but are likely to include:

- Increased awareness of different forms of communal living in the UK, especially in relation to the lesser-known options of housing co-ops and cohousing;
- Better knowledge of the possibilities and limits of different forms of communal living, and how economic, temporal, spatial and ideological factors combine together to make co-residence more or less successful in different contexts (thus highlighting practical steps that could be taken to make communal living more tolerable in contexts where it is less successful); 
- Better knowledge of the pros and cons of existing regulation affecting different forms of communal living, eg the advantages and disadvantages of Lodger Agreements;
- Insights into the possibilities and limits of communal living arrangements at different stages of the lifecourse, including in mid-life and older age (organisations such as Age UK may have a particular interest in this latter point, eg the potential for older people to remain living in their own homes through taking in lodgers (including to provide assistance of various kinds), or the potential of cohousing to similarly prolong residential independence);
- Insights into the everyday realities of sharing and lodging: these living arrangements have become more common as a consequence, at least in part, of government housing reforms, yet on the basis of little knowledge of how such arrangements operate and why people adopt such arrangements. The insights of those who share/lodge primarily as a consequence of constraint will be particularly valuable, including to housing associations and third sector organisations who provide group homes/shared accommodation to (especially vulnerable) client groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>435368</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A short film based showing collaborations between the Under the Same Roof team and housing experts outside the university (featuring external speakers from St Vincents Housing Association, Salford City Council, Crisis and MHA).

This was reflected in the make-up of our Advisory Group, which consisted largely of housing professionals from the voluntary, local government and commercial sectors. As a result, we were able to build useful links and connections which provided us with a platform for bringing together others with similar interests. We brought many of these contacts together at an event we organised in June 2014 (with IAA funding) which focused on shared housing options outside of the private rented sector, including shared tenancies in housing association properties, homeshare schemes (which, through matching older people with care needs with younger people in housing need, allow older people to remain independent in their own homes), and affordable shared social housing tenancy schemes specifically for young adults. Delegates told us that they had valued the opportunity to get together with other professionals in this area, as shared provision is such a niche interest beyond the private rented sector. 

One of our most important (and ongoing) connections has been with Crisis, the national charity for homeless people. Shortly after our own project was launched, Crisis launched its 'Sharing Solutions' programme, aiming to increase the supply of shared housing in the private rented sector for marginally housed people, to support the creation of sustainable shared tenancies, and to gather learning about different models of sharing. The Sharing Solutions programme was initially funded by DCLG for 18 months, and Crisis then extended the project into 2016 with additional funding. Eight private rented access schemes, operating in a variety of different housing markets around the country, were funded to set up and deliver services linked to the provision of shared accommodation options. We invited the Shared Solutions coordinator (Ella Wesolowicz) to join our Advisory Group and we met together regularly over the life of the two projects to discuss our respective work. Ella participated in two of our stakeholder events, as a speaker for one and as chair for a stakeholder dissemination event which we ran in London at the end of the project, whilst Sue Heath was invited to be a panel member for a Sharing Solutions event targeted at those working with marginally housed people seeking access to shared housing. Our own research did not focus specifically on the client group with whom Crisis works (although many of our research participants had past and current experience of poor quality housing, and some had been homeless in the past). Nonetheless, there were many points of similarity which emerged across our respective projects which supported our own strong sense that the same sorts of challenges arise for all sharers regardless of their economic resources and motivations. A more fundamental distinction therefore arises between those with access to the resources (economic, social, emotional) to deal with those challenges and those without such access. We were, then, able to feed into Crisis's work some of our own findings concerning factors that can make shared housing more or less tenable as a housing solution for vulnerable clients, and vice versa. Crisis were also able to use our findings as part of the evidence they gave in summer 2016 at a series of meetings hosted by the National Housing Federation to explore barriers and facilitators to increased provision of shared options in the social housing sector.

During the project we were also consulted about our project findings on several occasions. These included a meeting with a researcher from New Economy, an organisation which works on behalf of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the Greater Manchester Local Enterprise Partnership 'to deliver policy, strategy and research for Greater Manchester's economic growth and prosperity.' New Economy conducted research on the nature of housing demand amongst young professionals living in Manchester and we were able to provide input in relation to attitudes towards, and expectations of, shared housing provision amongst this demographic. We also met with the coordinator of 'Pinpoint', the 'Homes for Bolton' affordable housing portal, who wished to discuss similar issues in relation to clients in housing need, and were invited to attend a meeting organised by the Homeshare coordinator of the housing charity MHA to provide input into discussions about the challenges of intergenerational shared living. We were also approached by housing professionals from the city of Copenhagen who were exploring the possibility of providing shared housing options for young adults and were able to tell them about the UK experience.

Finally, we have been developing a set of teaching resources on the theme of shared housing, with funding from the University of Manchester's Humanities Strategic Investment Fund, and in collaboration with Crisis and Accent Housing Association (who were also represented on our Advisory Group). These resources, which are currently in the final stages of development, are targeted at young people who are likely to find themselves living in shared housing in the private rented sector in at least the early stages of their housing pathways. They cover topics such as budgeting, how to choose housemates, how to live with difference, and everyday organisational aspects of shared living (household chores, cooking rotas etc). We will be trialling these materials with young people in the near future, including via schools and the Students Union at the University of Manchester.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FB1A24E9-75CF-46F1-A608-960FA5F75933</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d4328bd950b6.08569329</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research aimed to explore the everyday relational practices of contemporary communal living with non-kin. Through the novel approach within this field of including contrasting forms of sharing within the one study, and sharers of all ages, we found that the key distinction often drawn between 'intentional' and 'unintentional' forms of sharing is an unreliable guide to the nature of everyday sharing practices. Contrasting forms of sharing often had much more in common than anticipated, with sharers facing similar challenges regardless of context. Further, the high expectations and deep personal investments often linked to intentional sharing could not only exacerbate the more challenging aspects of sharing, but heighten a sense of disappointment if expectations were thwarted. In contrast, sharers with low expectations often found their hopes exceeded. Distinctions between equal and unequal tenure status between residents often provided a more reliable guide to practice, particularly regarding the sharing of time and space. Accordingly, communally-orientated practices were less likely in private lodging arrangements, albeit with some marked exceptions where we found a strong communal ethos despite co-residents' unequal tenure status. These examples we termed 'quasi co-ops'. 

Achieving an appropriate balance between privacy and communality proved central to understanding if and how different shared households 'worked'. Specific practices relating to the ideological, temporal, spatial and economic facets of sharing could be placed on a continuum reflecting the degree to which they either protected the privacy of household members or fostered a communal ethic between them (eg eating alone or together; spending time in communal spaces or in one's bedroom; individual versus collective purchasing). Most households had developed a mix of practices which struck a balance between individual and collective needs, with the degree of fit between the expectations of individual sharers and other household members critical to whether these configurations of practices 'worked' or not. Grasping the importance of a pragmatic response to sharing facilitated a shift from an ultimately unhelpful sense that communal practices are somehow more virtuous than more individualistic practices.

Our research also contributes to broader debates on domestic intimacy and the frequent conflation of home and family. Non-familial living arrangements tend to 'surface' sharing processes that are rendered largely invisible or taken for granted within familial contexts. Forms of everyday intimacy that arise by virtue of living under the same roof tended to be viewed as altogether more intrusive in the former case, especially where co-residents may (at least initially) be relative strangers to each other. The co-presence of kin is thus tolerated in ways that the co-presence of non-family members is often not. This was particularly marked in relation to normative expectations of 'age-appropriate' living arrangements. Many older sharers had lived with non-kin for most of their adult lives, and were conscious that their living arrangements confounded many people's expectations, in contrast to younger sharers who were more readily able to fit shared living into age-appropriate narratives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have presented our work to diverse academic audiences, notably researchers of intimacy, relationships and personal life; housing studies; and intentional communities; and at both UK and international conferences. We will continue to disseminate in these fields, and will target our publications accordingly. We have a contract with Routledge to produce a jointly-written monograph of the project, due for publication in 2017. 

We have also presented our work to various stakeholder audiences, mainly in the field of housing policy and practice, and have developed good working relationships with both local and national organisations with a stake in the provision of shared housing, including Crisis and local government organisations in Greater Manchester. These are ongoing relationships. For example, Sue Heath will be speaking at the forthcoming Shelter Cymru 2016 conference, and we have University of Manchester follow-on funding to develop educational materials on shared tenancies (in collaboration with Crisis) targeted at older pupils and students. Housing experts working for local government in Copenhagen have also been interested in the relevance of our research to their work.

We will also be producing research briefings focusing on selected themes and designed for an interested lay audience, some of which will be policy and practice orientated.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4B39053C-837F-4BD1-9F3A-5E98D89AF711</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d41593a5eb89.69129111</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/morgancentre/our-research/home-and-housing/shared-housing/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2296BFE9-243A-4BBD-A790-94FAAC389FB1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making shared housing work</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Manchester Policy Blogs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37c75b88c7249fe1e7d9443c7a2ebe6d"><gtr:id>37c75b88c7249fe1e7d9443c7a2ebe6d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Heath, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545262c05c8900.72963830</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K006177/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
