Hypoxia normally triggers a reflex increase in breathing, which maintains oxygen levels. However, anaesthetics impair this reflex for many hours after surgery. Anaesthesia is generally safe but hypoxia remains by far the commonest cause of harm and death, especially in patients with heart or lung problems, so this side-effect of anaesthetic drugs is very important to all patients.

To develop techniques/drugs without this side-effect requires us to understand how anaesthetics work on cells of the carotid body (the organ detecting oxygen). We discovered that while some anaesthetics profoundly depress the breathing reflex, some others do not. We observed these differences in both the breathing reflex of humans and in their effect on carotid body function in animals. This suggests that causes for differences between anaesthetic drugs are embedded within mechanisms within the carotid body. It is especially interesting that one anaesthetic, nitrous oxide (laughing gas) even slightly enhances the breathing reflex. Thus laughing gas or other weakly-depressive agents may counteract the adverse breathing effects of another, more strongly-depressive anaesthetic, if the two are used in combination. We propose to test this idea (for laughing gas and other anaesthetic drugs) by studying both carotid body cell responses in animals and the breathing of volunteers, to learn more about the processes involved.

This knowledge will help develop safer drugs (ie, only those that have little or no depressive effect on the carotid body or the breathing reflex). And/or it may help develop better methods of prevention and management of hypoxia (eg, use of drug combinations that may be safer than using single-agent techniques of anaesthesia).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Anaesthetics depress human ventilatory hypoxic responses (VHR) with a specific order of potency (halothane&amp;gt;isoflurane&amp;gt;sevoflurane), diminishing the body's defence against hypoxia-related injury. Although we know how the carotid body may detect hypoxia, little is known about anaesthetic depression. We identified an O2-sensitive (TASK-like two-pore domain) background K+ (KB) channel, also sensitive to halothane, making it a candidate receptor for the anaesthetic effect. We then reported anaesthetics (halothane and isoflurane) depress glomus cell hypoxic response and increase KB channel activity, with the same order of potency as on whole-body VHR. We have recently discovered that while halothane strongly activates KB channels, isoflurane does so only weakly (ie, isoflurane is a partial agonist).

Common non-halogenated agents also have effects upon hypoxic responses ranging from inhibitory (eg, propofol) to excitatory (eg, N2O). These agents are reported to inhibit, activate or have no effect on cloned TASK channels but we wish to extend observations to native channels in isolated type-1 cells. 

Specifically, we wish (a) to ascertain which agents activate KB channels and if so, whether weakly or strongly; (b) to test whether the ability to activate KB channels is associated with an ability to inhibit glomus cell hypoxic response; (c) to test the possibility that agents which weakly activate KB channels can antagonise agents that strongly activate KB channels; (d) to characterise the specific channels using transgenic (knockout) mice. Finally, in a forward- translational approach, we wish (e) to assess if similar interactions between agents can be demonstrated at whole-body level in humans.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are several ways in which this study of fundamental mechanisms could have commercial application. (1) The potential to identify a molecular mechanism by which anaesthetics inhibit the glomus cell hypoxic response is theoretically applicable in drug design. It would be desirable to develop anaesthetics without this side-effect, as it would mean they better maintain the ventilatory response to hypoxia. (2) The glomus cell/KB channel response could itself become a commercial 'test' during drug design: only anaesthetic agents that had minimal effects on depressing glomus cell/KB channel response to hypoxia would be taken forward to further development. (3) Elucidation of which anaesthetics act as partial KB channel agonists might form the basis for potentially safer anaesthetic techniques using combinations of agents (either premixed or co-administered); these methods may form the basis of clinical trials (perhaps commercially-led) leading to further application by way of national or international clinical guidelines.

In summary, the potential impact of this research is on patients and their clinical care, on the NHS in terms of cost reduction, on clinical training, and (in the longer term) possible commercial collaborations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236665</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>14400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Project Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Difficult Airway Society (DAS)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>87380735-CF6C-49C0-B64B-B8D337AA4DE2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>i7B21MPxfM2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9991</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Mason Medical Research Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>72E4AD5E-6D84-46E9-8C36-FCD67AB933D2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>HXcY6UZzuJ5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B34B3C35-A447-4BB3-BE8D-DD8B98B0D85B</gtr:id><gtr:title>A method for continuous and stable perfusion of tissue and single cell preparations with accurate concentrations of volatile anaesthetics.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neuroscience methods</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/798c02c3de850763c760d459387fbd0c"><gtr:id>798c02c3de850763c760d459387fbd0c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Huskens N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0165-0270</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d191fda257d0.45736248</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/J011452/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
