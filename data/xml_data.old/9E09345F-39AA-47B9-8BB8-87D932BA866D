applied gaming technology</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K014072/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Servitization is the process of transforming manufacturers to compete through Product-Service Systems (PSS) rather than products alone. The commercial and environmental benefits of PSSs are compelling and well documented (Rolls-Royce earning over 50% of their revenue from services is cited to exhaustion). The opportunities are immense (three quarters of wealth world-wide is now created through performing services) and so politically PSSs are seen as key to industrial success in the 21st Century.
 
Adoption of PSS is frustratingly slow in mainstream manufacturing. Superficially the concepts find appeal but fail to gain traction as the potential implications to a business are complex. In the meantime, China is catching up (Chinese manufacturing companies offering services have grown from 2 - 20% since 2006). In the UK, we need to get better at informing, educating and training, our senior manufacturing managers about PSS and servitization, giving them the means to visualize the potential impact upon their business. 

Gamification offers a radical solution. Gamification bridges video-gaming technologies and computer simulations to offer three-dimensional virtual worlds, dynamic and content-rich, which can be used to entertain, educate and inform. This is especially innovative for user engagement, supporting behavior and attitudinal change, and the design of advanced human and computer interfaces for representing and handling complex data systems. This programme will therefore develop applied game technologies, design principles and protocols, to transform the adoption of PSSs within mainstream manufacturing companies and so accelerate the foothold of gamifiaction in strategic business analysis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This programme will impact:

(1) Our manufacturing partners who are SMEs (Technicut, Maher, Footprint, AMRC Ltd, Teks) as they will directly understand the form of a commercially successful PSS and so help them to immediately exploit servitization.

(2) Our large and cross-sectoral OEMs (Ford Motor Company, MAN Truck and Bus, Alstom Train-life Services, FinningCat and Xerox) represent a real market-pull for gamification. This immediate opportunity to exploit gaming technologies will directly impact their adoption of servitization within these organisations, customers and supply chains. 

(3) Our gaming partners will directly understand a commercial applications for gamification in business decisions and so can immediately set out to exploit this knowledge in their own organisations. The gaming networks (BSPA, GALA) will extend our reach to gaming companies, and help to demonstrate to these opportunities for further exploitation of gamification in business decision making..

(4) We will also impact manufacturers nationally. We have engaged (UKCEB, Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS)) will enable the roll-out of gaming technologies for servitization nationally. Has supported over 135,000 SMEs over the past ten years, and expects to impact a similar group in the future. SEMTA and the National Skills Academy for Manufacturing will further impact businesses through training programmes. 

These outcomes represent a win-win for the manufacturing and ICT communities. Manufacturing companies will gain a clear understanding of PSS and pathways towards servitization. To illustrate, we estimate that in the West Midlands alone there are some 4000 companies, employing 10-250 people, which are likely to have some interest in servitization. If only a very small portion of these adopt servitization strategies, the potential is for our project to generate a GVA of around &amp;pound;3 - &amp;pound;5.5 million per year in this region alone.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>727671</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A short animation to explain the complex concept of servitization to those with no knowledge.

The visit had the purpose to develop the community around gamification for servitization. Part of the visit was to take part in a workshop in which academics at COPPEAD presented the ongoing research projects in their institution followed by a presentation of the research developments at Aston Centre for Servitization Research and Practice (ACSRP) and discussions of synergies between the two centres and how gamification could be applied in their context of research. The first outcome was the possible application of gamification aiming at increased patient adherence to prescribed treatment - along the lines of gamification as a way to influence behaviour.

These will be developed and quantified as the programme develops.
We have developed an extensive research framework based on the analysis of 232 journal publications on servitization (published between 1988 and 2015). This framework demonstrates (a) the developed topics which identify relatively established knowledge relevant to the topic of servitization, (b) the developing topics which identify the growing concentrations and opportunities, and (c) the undeveloped topics which identify significant opportunities for further exploratory studies. One of the key aims of this framework is to enable researchers to develop a close relationship with both large and small (SMEs) manufacturing firms to understand their organisational change towards servitization and advanced services. 
To facilitate this, we have formed our Advanced Services Partnership, which enables our researchers to engage in a mutually beneficial partnership allowing manufacturers to better understand the servitization business model. The goal of the partnership is defined as &amp;quot;To accelerate the adoption of advanced services across a range of manufacturing businesses.&amp;quot;. The partnership consists of members from significant multinational manufacturing, each competing in a different business sector, each on a journey to develop and deploy advanced services, and each engaged at an executive level. We have been conducting two 2-day round tables with the partners so far, each covering relevant topics on servitization i.e. the first workshop was held in October 2015 at KLM-AirFrance facilities in Amsterdam to cover the understanding the journey towards the adoption of advanced services, and the second workshop was held in January 2016 at Goodyear in Luxembourg to analyse the business model design and customer value proposition for advanced services. The third round table was held in April 2016 at Ishida Europe in Birmingham, and the fourth at Yanmar Europe in Amsterdam in October 2016. 
These round tables regularly occur every four months and are a strong platform for industrial collaboration.
Additionally research has inputted into the development of a benchmarking tool and two servitization games and led to further game development with industry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Since 2013, we have organised an annual Spring Servitization Conference to bring other academics in the field and manufacturing businesses with an interest in servitization together. Attendance is generally between 50 and 110 delegates. Conference papers are published in the conference proceedings which are printed and available on-line.
Our spin out company, The Advanced Services Group, was incorporated in October 2015, and is made up of Advanced Services Research; Advanced Services Partnership, Advanced Services Programmes and Advanced Services Consultancy.
This company will facilitate dissemination and allow practitioners to information about the findings of our research and it to be put to use in practical applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A1C63B17-6DEB-49F8-8334-C06E1980E58C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a4327b04e89.11461250</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.aston-servitization.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Through Life Engineering Services (TES) Council</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA1B1492-B2AC-4110-A149-9321EA7E75CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The TES Council are lobbying Government to make the case for a national focus on Through-life Engineering Services (TES), as part of the UK Industrial Strategy.
