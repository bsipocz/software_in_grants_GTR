The new National Risk Register, published in January 2012, provides formal recognition of this and notes more work is needed to understand and plan for the impacts of severe events. This message was echoed in the February 2012 report of the House of Commons Defence Committee on Developing Threats: Electro-Magnetic Pulses. This noted the need for more research to understand and mitigate the space weather impacts, especially on the National Grid.

The UK has a wide range of world-class expertise to understand and deal with the problems caused by space weather. However, this is spread over the universities, research institutes, industry and government labs. There are many informal links between people at working level in these groups, but no structure that can coordinate their efforts to maximise the benefit to the UK and to mutual benefit of the groups involved. This proposal seeks to do that. We will hold a series of events that bring together experts from the research and applications communities - first to discuss how to coordinate UK efforts in particular areas and then to build up a virtual UK Space Weather Centre. The particular areas of space weather interest will include impacts on power grids, aviation, satellite navigation, communications and the tracking and operation of spacecraft.

A key aim will be better links between the UK space weather research and applications communities, so that researchers are ever more aware of the many potential routes through which their research can have impact on real-world issues - and the applications community appreciates the scientific capabilities that exist in the UK and the links that the scientific community has with other experts around the world. Such links will help the UK to develop a strong research programme that helps to mitigate the problems caused by space weather and that enables researchers to seek funding for their work. The results of that programme will also enable the UK to work with international partners, especially the US and in Europe, to develop international measures that recognise and deal with the global threat from space weather. The UK can then contribute to international efforts at a level appropriate to its technical and financial capabilities whilst deriving benefit from the whole of those efforts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The over-arching aim of this project is to develop better links between research on space weather and the needs of industry and governmental groups that have to handle the adverse impacts of space weather - and thereby stimulate and promote research that will improve the ability of those groups to handle those impacts. Thus the beneficiaries include:

1. Commercial organisations that operate technological systems at risk from space weather. There is growing awareness that many business operations may be affected by space weather. Thus companies will benefit from stimulation of research that quantifies these effects and identifies where space weather knowledge can significantly improve business processes. Key beneficiaries for such impact are high-volume businesses where small improvements can have high financial return (e.g. power grids) and businesses with high-value products that need to be protected from adverse impacts (e.g. magnetic surveys). 

2. Some of these commercial organisations operate critical national infrastructures such as the National Grid, the civil aviation system and satellite communication services. These need to be protected from severe space weather, as recognised in the 2012 National Risk Register. Thus the benefits of this project will be space weather support for (a) wider national activities that address the resilience of those infrastructures - and (b) UK participation in EU and international efforts to improve resilience of critical infrastructures. It will benefit government policy makers by stimulating the generation of new peer-reviewed scientific evidence that can guide policy decisions, e.g. better specification of extreme space weather conditions.

3. Many public sector activities are affected by space weather, e.g. communication, navigation and surveillance systems used by the military and security services. Both operators and policy-makers will benefit from this project through a better awareness of the limitations that space weather imposes on those systems and by encouraging research that can help users mitigate and manage those limitations.

4. The wider public will benefit from the more balanced reporting of space weather that we seek to promote. We already have examples of people being scared by current media hype - and reassured by good public engagement from space weather experts. We will continue that work and promote best practice in the reporting of space weather.

The benefits from this project will include both short-, medium- and long-term elements. In the short-term the major benefit will be increased awareness of space weather amongst beneficiaries and, perhaps, the adoption of better procedures for handling space weather problems, e.g. the proposed workshop will enable beneficiaries to know which scientists can provide timely advice when they encounter problems or wish to plan for future risks. The medium-term element will be the stimulation of research projects. The proposed workshops will enable researchers and beneficiaries to identify where new science can improve the understanding and mitigation of space weather problems. Thus an outcome of this project will be the submission of research proposals to study that new science, with some support (e.g. data and advice) from beneficiaries. We hope to see a good number of these proposals, with some funded and underway by the end of this project. The long-term benefit will the establishment of a UK space weather centre that will be a focus through which researchers and beneficiaries can come together to explore future space weather problems, e.g. arising through deployment of new technologies and services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33935</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The National Grid Co plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>What measures best capture space weather impact on power grid</gtr:description><gtr:id>10A237DF-4B3D-4F47-958C-DC5A28858BCF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not known</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7621e43404.08296102-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>At the moment there is no clear distinction between partner contributions, so it is all covered above.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A major challenge in assessing space weather risks to the power grid is to distinguish the extent to which a large geomagnetic storm will affect grid operation.

The conventional methods of classifying geomagnetic storms has only one category for large storms (a top value of 9 on the Kp index developed in the 1930s, or more recently as G5 storms using the US space weather scales). But the impact on the power grid of a G5 storm may vary from minimal to catastrophic - perhaps one in 40 of G5 storms will give that catastrophe.

This is an FP7 project (https://www.qb50.eu/) that will launch a large number of cubesats (small satellites around 1 kg mass) to measure conditions in the upper atmosphere, which is strongly influenced by space weather. This mission is a great opportunity to improve our understanding of the impact of space weather on the terrestrial environment - for the first time making simultaneous in-situ satellite measurements at such a large number of points. The SEREN involvement enabled many UK scientists to engage with the QB50 team (from UK and Belgium) to discuss optimising the scientific return, which will be valuable for understanding space weather.

The key outcome was a better sense of what is needed to improve space weather forecasting, as well as identifying gaps in our understanding.

Hosted by STFC/RAL Space, 9/10 July 2014. Aim was to review current state-of-art in, and near-term plans for, measuring and modelling the HMF, to assess how this fits with needs of space weather forecasters and discuss how future research can better match measurement and modelling capabilities to those needs. Meeting engaged industry (Airbus DS), government bodies (DSTL, Met Office and UK Space Agency) as well as academics from six UK groups funded by STFC and NERC. We also had strong US participation, reflecting the global nature of the problem, with attendees from the US Space Weather Prediction Center, Haystack Observatory and European Office of Aerospace Research &amp;amp; Development.

It has stimulated and encouraged wide UK community discussion on future measurements and modelling of the HMF, in particular the Carrington mission concept being developed by Airbus DS UK in collaboration with RAL Space, Met Office, Imperial College and MSSL.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54576755c4fde9.61980248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twiki.ukssdc.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/SEREN/BzWorkshop1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Awareness workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9183BBC6-E4AC-40F3-A0D2-9EACF88E9AE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The adverse impact of space weather on advanced technologies has become an important motivation for research into the physical processes that occur in the Sun, in the solar wind, and in the magnetosphere, atmosphere and lithosphere of the Earth (as well as studies of the vulnerable technologies). This meeting sought to explore how the UK scientific community can best respond to that motivation, by raising community awareness (a) of the multiple pathways by which solar activity leads to adverse technological impacts, and (b) of the complexity inherent in these pathways, especially the driving of geomagnetic and ionospheric storms by coronal mass ejections. This was done through a mix of talks on the science and impacts of space weather by relevant experts from universities, research institutes, industry and government. The consequent exchange of ideas was welcomed by many, if not all, attendees. 

One important conclusion from the meeting was the need to develop a common vocabulary to support dialogue about space weather across these diverse communities. Thus it is proposed to develop a space weather dictionary as part of the follow-up from this meeting.

The meeting reviewed the status of current UK work in this area, showing that the country provides a substantial fraction of the current global capability for such measurements, which is itself much less than what is required (e.g. as specified by WMO working group on space weather). This was a first step to bringing groups together to develop a more coordinated UK approach to the operation and furture development of ground-based space weather observations

The participants all agreed to some &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot; - to develop a set of white papers on different instrument types, the prospects for future development (e.g. better use of modern technology to reduce operating costs) and the fit to WMO requirements on space weather measurements. These will be prepared over coming months and reviewed at a follow-up event later in 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>53302fd0d4f255.55047322</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twiki.ukssdc.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/SEREN/Meeting1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 1 on geomagnetically induced currents</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7CE74801-1DF4-4980-BB4F-7AB819EB6909</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting of 25 experts on geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in power grids. Held at British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, March 5/6, 2014. Aim was to explore how future research in space weather can improve mitigation of the problems caused by GIC. Meeting engaged industry (e.g. National Grid, Scottish Power and Atkins) and policy-makers (Cabinet Office and Scottish Government) as well as academic in STFC and NERC communities (important to link these two communities). We also engaged top-level international expertise, from Canada, Ireland, Sweden and South Africa (another important link as this is global problem).

To soon to judge. Follow-up workshop planned for Autumn 2014 will bring this out.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>53302e6b4f2b74.48097111</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twiki.ukssdc.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/SEREN/FirstMeeting</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The most significant achievement of this STFC Futures Programme award was the bringing together of UK ground-based space weather experimenters to review the status, capabilities, and suitability of instruments in the UK research base for operational space weather services. The key findings were:
UK instruments contribute significantly to international networks on which emerging space weather services are being founded. Typically providing up to 15% of the global assets.
The instruments are supported based solely on their research value and there is currently no economic model to co-fund the instruments for their added value to space weather operations. Most of the instruments had no identified support beyond 2 years.
The instruments are capable of meeting space weather observing standards set out by the World Meteorological Organisation but additional investment is required to achieve this (e.g., adaption for dual research-and-operations purpose and near-real-time data transfer).
In summary, space weather service development is vulnerable to a reliance on ground-based instruments designed and supported for scientific research purposes rather than commercial need or public good. Some progress has been made on addressing this, as outlined below.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>An outcome has been the development of the Space Weather Operational Observing Network (SWOON) concept whose aim is to upgrade existing UK ground-based instruments in the Scandinavian, British and Atlantic sectors to standards necessary for supporting 24/7 space weather services. This was submitted (with EISCAT_3D) to the BIS Consultation on Proposals for Long-Term Capital Investment in Science &amp;amp; Research in 2014 and as a NERC capital bid but has yet to receive support.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DB01C45F-1DC3-4195-864E-9D530FADB4AF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e014c42da177.32676948</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>International coordination on space weather</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C2EE420-CCCC-44DD-9DEC-59B4C4FED404</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussions at SEREN events have helped to advance thinking on how scientific ideas can best be deployed to mitigate space weather risks and to communicate the risk to the general public. This has helped UK space weather experts to support inter-governmental workshops that seek to improve coordination between different countries, e.g. a UK-US workshop on power grid risks in Feb 2015 (also attended by experts from Canada and Ireland), also an EU-led work on rail system risks in Sep 2015 (participation from UK, Sweden, Spain, US, Austria, Canada). The follow-up from these workshops is unclear at the time of writing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6d93f264a2.18086843</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>An international governing body for space weather</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5806E73D-5875-4499-8863-A80E22549AA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of the questions raised at the SEREN workshops was the lack of an international governing body for space weather. The International Space Environment Service (ISES) would seem to be well-positioned to take on this role. Subsequent discussions suggest that ISES has this role in principle, but in practice it does not currently have the formal governance arrangements and structures in place to manage and develop global operational services. Thus the impact from SEREN is to encourage key UK players, in particular Met Office, to promote the development of ISES towards a practical role as the international governing body for space weather. This will benefit all at risk from space weather, the UK far from least in being exposed to that risk.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddab78baf328.17620940</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>SEREN - some thoughts from Bz workshops.

Telluric monitoring describes the monitoring of these fields and associated earth currents - and is a long-established technique. British Geological Survey resumed the technique some years ago - making routine measurements at their 3 main UK geomagnetic observatories in Devon, Scottish Borders and Shetland. SEREN has contributed to this by reinforcing the case to continue these measurements - through discussions at the SEREN workshop on power grid impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EB1126AA-9B12-4EFB-881D-FC6F0D2FD78B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SEREN workshops have reinforced the value of these measurements as they provide a powerful means of validating models used to assess and forecast space weather impacts on power grids. The mediating role of the geoelectric field means that these measurements can enable us to check intermediate steps within physics-based models of space weather impact. This all adds weight to the case for BGS to continue these measurements.

The SEREN workshops have also raised international interest in these measurements.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7bfc231d65.81009190</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Telluric monitoring in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/data_service/space_weather/geoelectric.html</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Participation in SEREN encouraged Sheffield University to work on new tool for CME/Flare predictions</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE1BC37E-907A-4A67-BE9E-B895BA544253</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two ApJ papers accepted (reported under publications); tool to be released soon</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c02eee8d07b0.65279497</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>New tool for CME/Flare predictions</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Following discussions at the SEREN workshop on power grid impacts, British Geological Survey, University of Lancaster and Met Office started a project to develop a low-power magnetometers for space weather monitoring, partly funded through an STFC grant.
