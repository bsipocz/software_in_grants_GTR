To interpret the sparse evidence for ancient farming methods, archaeologists and historians draw heavily on comparison with recent, non-mechanised farming, but detailed and systematic information on such recent farming is not readily available. This project brings together a wealth of original observations of 'traditional' farming (from ploughing and sowing to reaping and storage) and interviews with the now increasing elderly and scarce practitioners of non-mechanised farming. Observations and interviews have been carried out over 30 years in Spain, S France, Italy, Cyprus and especially Greece.\n\nThis fieldwork has shown that 'traditional' Mediterranean farming was both diverse and flexible. Farmers operated under the relatively timeless constraints of Mediterranean climate and topography and of a simple technology, but flexibly adjusted what they grew (and how and when and where) to variation in weather, labour supply, prices, the demands of the household and landlord, etc.. Farmers based their flexible decisions both on close observation of their own and their neighbours' crops and on a stock of sayings, stories and parables that encapsulated traditional knowledge and customs. Farming practices were shaped not only by practical considerations, but also by local and regional traditions and toolkits. Regional tool types often imposed distinctive sets of motor habits that reinforced the tendency for shared identity to be associated with shared ways of performing particular farming tasks; these in turn helped neighbours to work together (particularly important at harvest time) both efficiently and safely. Traditional farming has to be seen as an integrated whole, because the way a field was tilled and sown influenced ease of reaping and crop cleaning, and vice versa. For this reason, the tendency of farmers to extol the virtues of perfectionism was not as irrational as is widely thought by outsiders, and farmers often used signs of good workmanship when choosing whom to hire, for whom to work and to whom to marry their children.\n\nThese flexible recent farmers offer important insights into the nature of ancient farming and challenge many prevailing ideas. The potential and pitfalls, of using 'traditional' Mediterranean farmers as a guide to the distant past in this region, are evaluated with examples drawn from a range of prehistoric and early historic contexts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29074</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G008388/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
