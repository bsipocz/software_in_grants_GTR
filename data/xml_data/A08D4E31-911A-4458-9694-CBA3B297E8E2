Young people with Coeliac Disease (CD), an autoimmune condition triggered by the ingestion of gluten (found in wheat, rye and barley) are faced not only with the necessity to follow a life-long gluten-free diet, but have to juggle this against their need for peer acceptance, identity formation, a distancing from authority figures (including medical staff), and a move towards independent self-care.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Research has shown that dietary self-management can be difficult for young people and can impact on physical and psychological well-being.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of this project is to develop a DVD resource for young people with CD to try to assist with self-care responsibilities and the difficult transition from childhood (when their diet is controlled by a parent) to young adulthood (managing their diet themselves).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The DVD will be created in partnership with Coeliac UK, representatives from gastroenterology, dietetics, and psychology, together with experts in the creation of educational health programmes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The resource will be evaluated through focus group discussion, with a view to it being adopted by Coeliac UK for all newly diagnosed young people in the UK.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99330</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Following the evaluation of the original DVD resource &amp;quot;Gut Feelings: young people and their experience of coeliac disease&amp;quot;, qualitative feedback was incorporated into the development of a second version of the resource.

A very small revenue has been received as a result of this venture. However, a decision has been made to distribute the DVD to young people via events such as Gluten Free Food Fairs and the Allergy Show, and some positive feedback has been received. This dissemination of the material is an ongoing venture.

Since the last submission, the DVDs continued to be sold on Amazon, but yielded very little revenue or interest. Therefore they have now been removed from sale. 50 of each DVD were distributed by the charity Coeliac UK at the Allergy Show in Glasgow in March 2016, free of charge, to parents and young people. The response was positive. This will be an on-going venture, with a further distribution of DVDs at the Birmingham Coeliac Food Fair in June 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>615F7FB1-F515-458D-A20B-4665E2F05956</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447a49b761552.39105828</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>37B98A03-BB3D-419E-8C33-06DF94132D22</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gut feelings : young people and their experience of coeliac disease : the development and evaluation of a DVD resource</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ddb9f861b88c2cfc6c9a8e2320a9e2f3"><gtr:id>ddb9f861b88c2cfc6c9a8e2320a9e2f3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ruth Howard (Speaker)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_9326190674cb93703e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-189-25-0209</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I015957/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
