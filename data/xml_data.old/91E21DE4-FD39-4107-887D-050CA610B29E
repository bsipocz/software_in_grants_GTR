This affects a
permanent genetic change in the target which is propagated through to its progeny. While there are several means of
genetic modification, few are capable of permanent modification of target cells. Amongst all vectors for gene delivery, LV
are unique in unparalleled efficiency, safety, lack of toxicity and ability to modify non-dividing target cells. They have
therefore come to be recognised as a key reagent required for the efficient development of the burgeoning cell therapy, as
well as gene therapy industries. However, although LV represent a well understood and robust technology, there is no
manufacturing methodology for very large-scale LV production. This is now an acknowledged bottle-neck both for clinical
trials and for commercial exploitation of many cell and gene therapy products in current development. We propose to
address this unmet need</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>* Lentiviral vectors (LV) are used to genetically modify target cells. The main commercial application of LVs is in vitro
production of cellular therapeutics, although they can be used as therapeutic agents in their own right and for generation of
protein producer cells. While small-scale production is well established, a process for very large-scale production has not
been developed. Recently, commercial demand for LV has increased greatly. Large-scale production is a major unmet
need and its lack a bottleneck esp. in the marketing of cellular therapies. The challenge of large-scale LV production is
multifaceted, requiring a deep understanding of lentiviral biology, as well as skilful genetic and cellular engineering,
appreciation of regulatory / GMP considerations, industrial/pharmaceutical scale production issues as well as an
understanding of the down-stream clinical applications.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As described in proposal submitted to IUK</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>584844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cell Therapy Catapult</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Vector Industrialisation Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>612A6F6C-2039-47AB-A58C-9F1FC1F127F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project is contributing to the development of new therapies and therapeutic strategies, particularly with respect of the industrial scale manufacture of cell and gene therapy vectors, thus contributing both to better health care and to creation of wealth, including inward investment from outside the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e545de11e208.59311162-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Funding of the initial studies, providing the vector manufacturing cell line and expertise in project management, accurate calculation of costs of goods.

The IP generated, the facilities and the experience of working on the Roche supported projects have in turn resulted in the attraction of manufacturing contracts from a US Biotech company (Northwest Bio - 1.2M), from a French company focused on the generation of allogeneic T cells expressing Chimeric antigen Receptors (Cellectis, over &amp;pound;11M between 2016 and 2019). The contract with this compnay, Cellectis, is worth in total about &amp;pound;15M over the next 3 years (2016-2019). We are also engaged in a fruther collaborations with a new biotech company in UK (Autolous) for the production of retroviral vectors that are used in the generation of other CAR-T cells for clinical studies.
