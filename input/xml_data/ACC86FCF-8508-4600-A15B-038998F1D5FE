Social enterprise represents an especially interesting context in which to examine these issues. Specifically, social enterprises have been placed under increasing pressure from funders and policy makers to become more commercially focused and to develop more of their revenue through market-based activity. At the same time, they have been placed under increasing pressure from funders and policy makers to improve their social impact and to adopt particular practices in order to make them more accountable to stakeholders. &lt;br />&lt;br />The need to be both more commercially orientated and to achieve greater social outcomes has generated a series of organisational tensions that many social enterprises have struggled to reconcile. At the heart of these tensions are issues of culture, identity and control. In addition to contributing to organisation theory, the research is intended to yield important insights for social enterprises seeking to manage the apparent conflict between the creation of social and commercial value.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197225</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk at Kingston University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A00590A-AA6D-407F-878B-93805979975C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a talk on one of the papers that I have drafted using the data collected as part of my ESRC mid-career fellowship.

Abstract: We present the results of a case study of Keystone Development Trust, a social enterprise designed to promote social and economic development in the East of England. As part of its activities, Keystone initiated a program of support for a highly stigmatized group of migrant workers. Its association with this group led to the transfer of stigma from the migrants to Keystone, a process we refer to as stigma contagion. As a result of the organization's stigmatization, Keystone faced a crisis of organizational legitimacy externally and a crisis of organizational identity internally. We examine Keystone's responses to stigma contagion, highlighting the forms of legitimacy work and identity work in which managers engaged. Interestingly, we find not only that the effects of organizational stigma can be managed, but that stigmatization may have positive effects for organizations in addition to the negative consequences that have already been well documented.

Symposium abstract: Throughout the last century, public corporations have been the emblematic organizational form of the contemporary capitalism. However, at the turn of the new century, their dominance as the typical form of business organization has gradually declined (Davis, 2011), and this trend is accompanied by the growth of alternative organizational forms such as mutuals, cooperatives, state-owned enterprises, social enterprises and public-private hybrid organizations, possibly representing a historical transition towards the organizationally diverse capitalism (Schneiberg, 2011). This symposium traces this emerging trend by drawing on diverse academic investigations into novel organizational forms which would serve as alternatives to 20th-century corporations. In doing so, we seek to attract scholarly attention to this emerging phenomenon, and to encourage future organizational research to go beyond the rigid frame of corporations and embrace the novel research possibility enabled by the enhanced organizational diversity in future economy.



I gave a talk entitled &amp;quot;Challenges and Opportunities for Social Enterprise in Contemporary Capitalism: A View from the Inside&amp;quot; in which I used data from my ESRC funded study to consider social enterprise as an alternative to the corporation.

While culture is evident at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., in logics, categories, frames, and identities) and at multiple stages of the organizational life cycle (e.g., new venture creation, growth, death) which are variously emphasized by different theories, there is a common assumption that firms which fail to resonate with relevant cultural beliefs risk problems associated with a lack of legitimacy. Despite these hazards, combining elements from different meaning systems - or cultural mixing - is a common practice, implicating both organizations and their products. As such, this session is oriented around an important, yet unresolved, tension: if cultural mixing is problematic, why is it so prevalent across empirical domains and how can we account for instances where it is positively received? We intend for the session to provide the opportunity for the cross-pollination of ideas, a discussion on how best to conceptualize the linkages and overlap between these theories as they pertain to cultural mixing, and finally an agenda for developing new theory on the topic.



I gave a presentation on &amp;quot;Social Entrepreneurship as Cultural Mixing&amp;quot; in which I used findings from my ESRC funded study to show the challenges of mixing ideas and practices from different cultural spheres.

Here I would like to emphasise a much broader impact that was not envisioned when I began the study.

Following my Fellowship, I began working with Neil Stott, the Chief Executive of Keystone, on social enterprise related teaching and events at the Judge Business School. The was very successful and led directly to the creation of the Centre for Social Innovation at Cambridge, which is based at the Judge:

http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/social-innovation/

I am the Academic Director of the Centre and Neil is the Executive Director. It has already organised a series of events and initiatives supporting social enterprise, including a recent conference on poverty. Perhaps most importantly it allowed the Judge to become a partner in Social Incubator East, a social enterprise accelerator in Cambridge. Neil and I are also leading the development of a new part-time Masters degree in Social Innovation, which is designed to augment participants capacity to engage in leadership for social change. This is a very exciting development and will ensure the impact of the ESRC award lasts far into the future. Our first cohort of students will start in October 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5EA25DA8-4F69-44AE-A8A4-385C557D9DA8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54608163607642.53133426</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Much research in organization studies assumes that organizations exist in a kind of a vacuum and often ignores the role of broader social and institutional processes in shaping organizational behaviour. On the other hand, research on the social and institutional context of organizations tends to ignore what happens inside organizations. This research seeks to help bridge these two perspectives and to address what is sometimes called the 'micro-macro divide' in the study of organizations. To investigate these issues I spent nine months working (unpaid) at Keystone, a social enterprise in the East of England. Keystone runs a series of business ventures and a range of social and community initiatives. 

The study has led to three papers (one of which is still in development). The first paper explores what happens when organizations become aligned with 'unpopular' or stigmatized groups in their institutional environments. It shows that organization can themselves become stigmatized through a process of 'stigma contagion'. This process has profound effects not only on their identity and legitimacy. The second paper explores what happens when organizations attempt to heal conflicts or rifts in their institutional environment. It shows how organizations can use particular kinds of institutional work in order to break down barriers between rival groups. The third paper, currently being drafted, explores how individuals in organizations experience, and use to their advantage, multiple pressures in the environment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings are particularly important for researchers interested in the potential and limitations of organizations that support migrants. For academics, additional work on how tensions within communities can be eased by social purpose organizations represents an important avenue for future research. This links to broader theoretical issues in social sciences about the extent to which actors can exercise agency when addressing deep rooted social problems.

My project also has implications with respect to research methods. Specifically, it shows that participant observation can result both in data with the potential for publication in major journals, and have a significant impact on the organizations in which researchers are based. This type of 'engaged scholarship' may provide a template for others going forward.

For practitioners, an important aspect of my findings concerns how organizations that support migrants can manage their reputations and avoid stigmatization. And where stigmatization does occur, it suggests possible strategies for managing the likely negative consequences internally.
