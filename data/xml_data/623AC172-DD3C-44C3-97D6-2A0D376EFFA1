In conjunction with increased trade liberalisation in Brazil (applied tariff rates in 2012 are 25% of 1989 levels), transport costs become the most prominent non-artificial trade barrier associated with Brazil's growth of exports: It costs twice as much to export a container from Brazil compared to OECD countries and nearly twice as much compared to the average Latin American and Caribbean country. It takes 13 days and 6 documents to export a commodity, two days and two documents more than OECD countries. Of these figures, 3 days are allocated to port and terminal handling amounting to a fixed cost of 500 US Dollars per shipment, twice the amount of Germany's port costs. Similar magnitudes apply for importing procedures (World Bank Doing Business (2014)). 

As more than 80% of Brazil's exports is carried by sea (Ministry of Industry Development and Foreign Trade (2010)) and port efficiency appears to have the largest impact on trade among all indicators of infrastructure (Nordas and Piermartini (2004)), the necessity of improving port infrastructure and reduce shipping costs is inherently linked to development via export growth. 

This project will see collaboration between UCL and Universidad Federal do Rio de Janeiro. It intends to quantify the impact of port infrastructure and the cost of shipping on Brazil's exports, proposing responses to ameliorate these costs. Our approach is novel since we are going to combine trade data and information from port authorities with ship's satellite positioning data. This will provide a unique dataset in which we will be able to identify origin and destination of ships, time of each journey, ships' idle time at ports, ship's cargo at port destinations in theUSA and the cost of shipping from country of origin to the port of destination in the USA. 

The project will consist of visits and research exchanges (both UK to Brazil and Brazil to UK) in order to enable sharing of data and resources. This will enable the two research groups to build strong collaborative links and undertake knowledge exchange.

This project will deploy the research in a number of stakeholder engagement workshops, attended by representatives from each partner's research groups. The workshops will bring together policy makers, lawyers, shipping operators and other relevant stakeholders to further our understanding of the issues connecting shipping with trade and economic development, and enable us to share the research findings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will also provide a key international link for the research collaboration underway in the project Shipping in Changing Climates, a UK government (RCUK Energy programme) funded project that connects five UK university partners with a number of shipping stakeholders (Shell, Rolls-Royce, Lloyd's Register, BMT and MSI). This project will both enable the Brazilian partner to leverage the work undertaken by the Shipping in Changing Climates research team, and provide an international pathway to impact for that project helping to increase impact and disseminate its outputs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60013</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A comparison of Brazil-USA port infrastructure and its implications for trade, transport costs and emissions</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>145EA04F-5913-4E98-AB7A-8500F9B83A0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Nicholas Lazarou presented at the Workshop on Brazil's trade, transport costs and shipping greenhouse gas emissions organised by UCL in Brazil</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c835711942e3.89929786</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Shipping's GHG emissions: The post COP21 seascape</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8F3E0EA-D9FB-4C86-BB2C-9DFC8101F757</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Isabelle Rojon (UMAS) and Dr Nicholas Lazarou presented at an invite only workshop organised in Brazil looking at emissions from Shipping</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c830e1cc4dc9.12948572</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on Brazil's trade, transport costs and shipping greenhouse gas emissions</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D3DD92D-B32B-4568-AFD8-B532D94CE477</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop brought together a diverse group of experts to examine the nexus between Brazil's economic development/trade, transport costs, ocean transportation and resultant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58caa00e920871.80443743</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The grant enabled researchers to hold a workshop in Brazil to present the findings on the impacts of a market based measure on transport costs for Brazil.

Brazil appears to have higher and less predictable port times compared to the US (and the rest of the world):
- More Brazilian ports have average times &amp;gt; 3 days compared to US. All Brazilian ports are the highest ranking in throughput.
- Average time at Brazilian ports is 6.36 days compared to USA which is 3.82 days.
- Bulk Carriers and Tankers wait more in Brazil ports than in USA: 3.51 and 1.37 additional days respectively 
- General Cargo wait 6.13 days more in USA than in Brazil.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work has left many questions unanswered, e.g. the root causes of the delays in ports and its impact on export competitiveness.
