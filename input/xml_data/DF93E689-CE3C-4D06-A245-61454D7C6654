LIS is a data infrastructure of income and wealth data whose primary purpose is to enable cross-national, interdisciplinary primary research into socio-economic outcomes and their determinants. Whilst LIS is physically located in Luxembourg, users of the LIS microdata come from 70 countries including the UK. 

The work of acquiring, harmonising and documenting diverse datasets from multiple countries is labour intensive, requiring 10 or more full-time staff. In order to avoid having to charge individual user fees, LIS is seeking financial support to be able to continue providing researchers with access to high-quality data. This application seeks support from ESRC to help cover LIS' basic operating costs, which primarily consists of staff salaries and computer equipment.

LIS, the institution, houses two databases - the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS). LIS datasets include income, employment, and demographic variables at the person- and household-level. Since its founding, LIS datasets have been used by 4,300 researchers from around the world to analyse economic and social policies and their effects on outcomes including poverty, income inequality, employment status, wage patterns, gender inequality, family formation - and when combined with other datasets - child-wellbeing, health status, immigration, political behavior and public opinion. The newer LWS datasets enable research on wealth portfolios, asset levels, and the interplay between household income and wealth. 

The microdata contained in LIS and LWS are not accessible directly for reasons of confidentiality, and cannot be removed from the LIS office in Luxembourg. Therefore, only registered users may query the microdata via email to the remote-execution system, LISSY, a system-specific job submission interface. The users send programs and receive statistical summaries as the end product of their request. 

LIS is a unique resource, whose primary function is to facilitate research by providing controlled public access to household data. LIS is the only data archive in existence that includes income, wealth and labour market data, over time and in one place from such diverse geographic regions and at such varied income levels. LIS also provides a high level of user support and hands-on assistance to LIS and LWS researchers - through its online learning materials, user-support staff, and training workshops. LIS has also long operated as a venue for researchers and practitioners to exchange research ideas, results, and methods. These exchanges take place through the widely accessed Working Paper Series, the Visiting Scholar program, pre- and postdoctoral postings, annual workshops, conferences, and virtual venues. 

The participating countries are high-income and middle-income countries. LIS will continue to grow to include many more middle-income countries' datasets, enabling greater comparative opportunities in income, demographic, and labour market research. Additionally, LWS will continue to develop and grow, adding more countries and years, and thus facilitating new and expanded lines of research related to wealth.
 
The UK was one of the initial participants in both LIS and LWS. Individuals and organisations in the UK have been actively engaged with LIS for three decades, providing data, contributing financing and serving as board members. Since LIS' inception, researchers in the UK have queried the microdata; produced publications, government reports and working papers using the LIS data; attended summer workshops; participated in the Visiting Scholar program; contributed to research conferences and conference volumes; and provided invaluable intellectual guidance and direction regarding LIS' activities and products (names available upon request).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The funds sought in this proposal will contribute directly to enhancing the impact of LIS. Excellent research depends on high-quality data, and LIS provides high-quality data to researchers around the world. LIS depends on core contributions from participating countries, such as the UK, to fund data harmonisation, metadata preparation, and key IT infrastructure allowing data queries. LIS' essential contribution to researchers is to take over the time- and labour-intensive task of harmonising and documenting multiple datasets for cross-national research. 

LIS cross-national data are important in academia, supranational organizations, journalism and the &amp;quot;Third Sector.&amp;quot; The data have the potential to inform government policies at all levels in areas such as tax policy, educational policy, family leave benefits, and the like. The LIS and LWS Databases are significant resources for researches in many disciplines such as sociology, economics, political science, public policy, demography and public health, who are studying social and economic outcomes of public policies across high- and middle-income countries. 

LIS requests that all work using the databases be submitted as a working paper; the LIS, LWS and Technical Working Papers Series search engine on the website is accessible in full to the general public. Working papers do not preclude later publication in a peer-reviewed venue, in fact many papers are subsequently submitted for publication in academic journals, books and doctoral dissertations. There are nearly 600 papers available to date. LIS also produces &amp;quot;Key Figures,&amp;quot; which are national indicators on poverty and inequality that are available to all visitors to the website (www.lisdatacenter.org). LIS holds annual summer workshops, maintains a funded Visiting Scholars program, sponsors annual award stipends for outstanding research using the LIS and LWS Databases, sponsors periodic conferences and an annual, public, economics lecture series, and promotes its events through social media and various professional association listservs (e.g., European Sociological Association, International Sociological Association, European Economic Association, International Economic Association, Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association, European Society for Population Economics, etc.).

LIS actively engages in collaborations and intellectual exchanges with supranational agencies such as the OECD, UNICEF, and the World Bank, as well as with organisations doing similar work such as the EUROMOD project at the University of Essex, and IPUMS International at the University of Minnesota. The directors are regularly sought by journalists and government officials at all levels for commentary, as are individual researches whose scholarship is based on the LIS data. Commercial access to the microdata is prohibited by many of the countries that contribute datasets to LIS. 

LIS measures its impact in a number of ways, including query submission rates through the remote-execution system LISSY, working papers accumulation, the number of new and repeat registrants to the microdata, Google Analytics, and periodic assessments of print and digital media mentions. The staff collects participant evaluations at the end of each summer workshop, requests input from board members to set organisational priorities, and submits strategic plans and progress reports to funders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236025</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Narrative Impact Report

LIS Cross-National Data Center
2017

LIS Cross-National Data Center (LIS), formerly the Luxembourg Income Study, is an ongoing social science research infrastructure project that has received funding through the ESRC for many years. Funding from the ESRC, along with a matching grant from the ONS, contributes to LIS' overall core funding which funds data harmonization of datasets from high- and middle-income countries. Those datasets are lodged in the Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS) and the Luxembourg Wealth Study Database (LWS). LIS provides regulated access to these high-quality microdata to eligible researchers around the world; approximately 9% of eligible users are from the UK. LIS also generates Poverty and Inequality Key Figures, which are aggregated results based on the microdata, and that are available to a more general audience. This general audience includes individuals in the commercial sector, journalists, researchers in NGO's, and the like.

Key Findings

In this five year grant, LIS set out to achieve the following: 
- expand LIS, adding Waves IX (2013) and X (2016), and add new middle-income countries;
- develop LWS, adding another wave of datasets to existing countries; acquire new wealth datasets for 14 more countries in cooperation with the European Central Bank (based on the Household Finance and Consumption Survey);
- create a state-of-the-art metadata search and storage system;
- maintain international standards in data security and data infrastructure systems;
- provide high-quality harmonized household microdata to researchers around the world;
- enable interdisciplinary cross-national social science research covering 45+ countries, including the UK;
- aim to broaden its reach and impact in academic and non-academic circles through focused communications strategies and collaborations.

As the ESRC provides support for an ongoing infrastructure, key findings refers more directly to what LIS has achieved of its stated goals: 

LIS Expansion: 
Professor Daniele Checchi, an economist currently on sabbatical from the University of Milan, took over as &amp;quot;Director of the Luxembourg LIS Office&amp;quot; with effect from September 2016.
 
Expansion of LIS data: Wave VII and Wave VIII datasets are completed. Data requests to Belgium and Sweden have been consistently turned down, due to new constraints within those countries. We are striving to reach resolutions in these cases. About half of Wave IX (2013) is either harmonized and ready for use or in-house. 
Development of LWS data: The project is well underway, with datasets acquired with the assistance of the European Central Bank, based on wealth surveys fielded mainly in 2011. The grant is enabling a considerable expansion of the LWS Database for the first time in many years.
LIS has finalized 10 new LWS datasets. In addition, LIS has revised the wealth variables to take into account the recent developments of wealth data collection standards and guidelines from the OECD. The LIS data team will attend the Household Finance and Consumption Network Meeting to present the new LWS Database and preliminary results from the first 10 datasets. 
Technology: The metadata system METIS, an automatized documentation feature whose development was launched in 2016.

Usage
123 British users registered in 2016 out of the 1288 in total (about 10%); it is the second country in terms of number of users right after the USA. They come from more than 35 different institutions (university, public administration or non profit)
These users submitted 3003 jobs out of 63649 (about 5%).

Impact
Academic impact 
Measuring the impact of data harmonization at LIS is visible in the (mandatory) submission of users' academic papers to the Working Papers series. LIS maintains three active series: the LIS Working Papers Series, the LWS Working Papers Series, and the Technical Working Papers Series. 46 of the 65 working papers (all series) submitted since 2015 include UK data.

Researchers access LIS and LWS microdata to study a number of areas. In 2015, working papers using UK data examined inequality (50%), redistribution (30%), household consumption (12%) family policy (10%), gender (10%), wages and employment (15%), and poverty (15%) among other issues. 

Published articles based on recent contributions to the Working Papers Series appear in, for instance, International Review of Social Research, Comparative Economic Studies, Journal of European Social Policy, Political Research Quarterly, European Sociological Review, Review of Income and Wealth, and Journal of Economic Inequality.

- aim to broaden its reach and impact in academic and non-academic circles through focused communications strategies and collaborations.

As the ESRC provides support for an ongoing infrastructure, key findings refers more directly to what LIS has achieved of its stated goals: 

LIS Expansion: 
LIS is pleased to report an expansion of its leadership team. After an international search, Professor Daniele Checchi, an economist currently on sabbatical from the University of Milan, agreed to take over as &amp;quot;Director of the Luxembourg LIS Office&amp;quot;. Janet Gornick will continue as the &amp;quot;Director of the US LIS Office&amp;quot;. The addition of Checchi to the LIS leadership will commence officially in September 2016.
 

 
 
The main LIS offices moved in June to Belval, the new university and research campus outside Luxembourg City. The LIS office is in a brand new, green building near colleagues at LISER (formerly CEPS) and the social inequality unit of the University of Luxembourg. 
Expansion of LIS data: But for a few countries, Wave VII and Wave VIII datasets completed. Data requests to Belgium and Sweden have been consistently turned down, due to new constraints within those countries. We are striving to reach resolutions in these cases. About half of Wave IX (2013) is either harmonized and ready for use or in-house. 
Development of LWS data: In April, LIS was granted $350,000 by the U.S. National Institute on Aging to support an expansion of the LWS Database. The project is well underway, with datasets acquired with the assistance of the European Central Bank, based on wealth surveys fielded mainly in 2011. The grant is enabling a considerable expansion of the LWS Database for the first time in many years.
LIS has finalized 10 new LWS datasets. In addition, LIS has revised the wealth variables to take into account the recent developments of wealth data collection standards and guidelines from the OECD. The LIS data team will attend the Household Finance and Consumption Network Meeting to present the new LWS Database and preliminary results from the first 10 datasets. 
LIS is grateful for Senior Scholar Frank Cowell's advisement on the strategy of LWS as complex structure of data, such as accounting for replicate weights and multiple imputations of the data.
Technology: The metadata system METIS, an automatized documentation feature whose development was funded by a special grant from the US National Science Foundation, will benefit both LIS staff and front end users. METIS is undergoing a final round of testing in its beta format; LIS expects to launch the new feature in 2016.

Impact
As stated in the grant proposal, LIS actively monitors its relevance and impact. 

Academic impact 
Measuring the impact of data harmonization at LIS is visible in the (mandatory) submission of users' academic papers to the Working Papers series. LIS maintains three active series: the LIS Working Papers Series, the LWS Working Papers Series, and the Technical Working Papers Series. Submission to the working papers collection does not preclude submission to a peer-reviewed venue. 

Of the 33 working papers submitted to all three series in 2015, 70% included the UK microdata. This is broadly consistent with the average usage of UK data in working papers over the past grant cycle. 

Researchers access LIS and LWS microdata to study a number of areas. In 2015, working papers using UK data examined inequality (50%), redistribution (30%), household consumption (12%) family policy (10%), gender (10%), wages and employment (15%), and poverty (15%) among other issues. 

Published articles based on 2014-2015 contributions to the Working Papers Series appear in, for instance, International Review of Social Research, Comparative Economic Studies, Journal of European Social Policy, Political Research Quarterly, European Sociological Review, Review of Income and Wealth, and Journal of Economic Inequality. 

A new research brief series was launched from the US Office, with an initial piece authored by Janet Gornick and Branko Milanovic, &amp;quot;Income Inequality in the United States in Cross-National Perspective: Redistribution Revisited,&amp;quot; and the second by LIS pre-doctoral scholar Laurie Maldonado with SOFI scholar Rense Nieuwenhuis, &amp;quot;Single-Parent Family Poverty in 24 OECD Countries: A Focus on Market and Redistribution Strategies&amp;quot;. 
Economic and Societal impact

2015 Public programming:

Along with staff contributions to symposia and conferences, the following major public lectures took place in 2015:

1. In February, The LIS Center hosted Paul Krugman and Branko Milanovic in conversation at Eastern Sociological Conference (ESS) on Inequality, from the national to the global; moderated by Janet Gornick. 
2. In April, coinciding with Earth Day, LIS co-hosted the economists Joseph Stiglitz and Nicholas Stern for a discussion on the intersection between inequality and climate change. 
3. In May, Harvard University Press brought out Tony Atkinson's new book Inequality: What can be done? The book was the subject of a virtual book tour led by Janet Gornick in the US, including a filmed discussion between Robert Solow and Paul Krugman. The discussion is available on the LIS Center playlist, at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRZyktsPhrezOQMzP1hvm5bCYb2GWRx_r. 
4. In June, the US Office co-hosted a workshop on income inequality at the Graduate Center in New York. The workshop, &amp;quot;Inequality by the Numbers,&amp;quot; was quantitatively focused and broad in scope through five days of lectures and discussions given by an international cast that included: Janet Gornick, Conchita D'Ambrosio, Louis Chauvel, Michael Forster, Branko Milanovic, John Mollenkopf, Paul Attewell, Richard Alba, Ruth Milkman, Sarah Bruch, Jeff Madrick, David Howell, Leslie McCal, Nancy Folbre, Andrew Clark, Rense Nieuwenhuis and Thierry Kruten. The workshop was so successful that it will be run again in June 2016.
5. In November, Janet Gornick moderated a discussion on gender and care work that featured UN Women and their most recent report on the status of the world's women.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F4BD551A-4ED8-45FF-A320-8DC126D0100E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc395ea392c4.50243475</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L016273/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
