He has been a member of RAI council (its governing body), has undertaken consultancy reviews for them and has consulted regularly with them on matters concerning their archives and the possibility of digitisation. The current proposal has emerged from these ongoing discussions.\n\nThe Royal Anthropological Institute are happy to support the application because it provides them with the opportunity to benefit from sustained academic research on this part of their Archive collection. It fits well with their content strategy by scanning and fully cataloguing and their educational/ outreach remit through the organisation of an exhibtion. \n\nOne of the reasons they are particularly keen to participate in this collaboration is that the students' project will provide a wider, more general context than the detailed collection documentation usually provided by the catalogue. The final result will thus include a rich complementarity between the research of this project and the RAI's documentation work. The results will help future researchers to better understand the photographic archive.\n\nThis PhD research project will concentrate on how audiences in UK and Nigeria understand an exhibtion of images taken by Northcote Whitridge Thomas early in the C20th. Thomas was a government anthropologist, who undertook research amongst Igbo speaking people of Nigeria. His tours of duty took place during the first decade of the 20th century. The photographs are as yet uncatalogued and have not been used as the basis for research since Thomas himself. They represent an extraordinary historical document of a part of British colonial history and of Igbo culture a century ago.\nThe project has been designed as a piece of anthropological research which can enhance and complement the documentation of the Thomas archive and improve our understanding of what audiences gain from visiting exhibitions (and of how the topic can be studied). \n\nDissemination plans\nOther than academic conference papers and papers in peer-reviewed academic journals (both international and Africanist), the study will be reported in non-governmental fora, such as email discussion groups, on project related web pages and, subject to further discussion, in newspaper articles in Nigeria. Since the data collection involves holding an exhibition some dissemination will occur during the early part of the PhD project. It is hoped that the exhibition will be able to tour to other venues after the completion of the research project. This will be discussed with the RAI education officer during the preparation of the exhibition.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have impact on the Igbo diaspora community in UK through the mounting of an exhibition and the arrangement of school visits to it as part of the research.\n\nThe methodological issues to be considered as a part of the project will have an impact on professionals working in museums which seek to engage a wide multicultural audience.\n\nOutside the UK the project will have impact in Nigeria by making available to local audiences, the exhibition of historical photographs from their communities. It will benefit from the considerable experience of staff at the Pitt Rivers Museum in 'digital repatriation'. Beyond the lifetime of the project itself through the continuing accessibility via the RAI archives website of the source material, the photographs of NW Thomas, it will be of use to a variety of different audiences, in UK and Africa.\n\nThe Pitt Rivers Museum has its own NW Thomas collection (including 400 wax cylinder sound recordings): this project will serve as a pilot to developing a larger resource on this and other early sources on SE Nigeria. By making clear the links between PRM and RAI archives it will have impact on the planning of future exhibits and will act as a guide to research collaborations. The Pitt Rivers Museum has been a key player in the 'virtual reconstitution' of the collection of Captain Cook which will be a model here.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023422/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
