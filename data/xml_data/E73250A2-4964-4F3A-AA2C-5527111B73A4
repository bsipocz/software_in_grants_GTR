These volatile species are blended at key locations, which can be thought of as interfaces between major geological environments, where distinct geochemical reservoirs meet and interact. These interfaces are the prime locus of movement of volatile species from one Earth reservoir to another, and understanding the fundamental processes which act in these environments is key to unlocking the links between the deep Earth and its surface biosphere. The interfaces we have identified are: 

(i) oceanic ridges
(ii) subduction zones
(iii) the mantle transition zone (between the 410 and 660 km discontinuities)
(iv) the crustal plutonic realm

The UK has wide expertise in the areas relevant to volatile cycling in the Earth, and we believe that the UK can make a unique contribution to the problem. We propose to focus on the key solid Earth interfaces outlined above, where volatile species are transferred between major geochemical reservoirs, and to formulate fundamental but tractable questions that the UK community can answer with research programme (RP) scale investment. 

Because work in areas relevant to these problems involves a wide variety of techniques applied over a wide range of pressure and temperature regimes, formulation of these problems is the key challenge of this scoping phase.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As a scoping study, the proposed facilitated workshop format will be open only to academic researchers. At such an early stage in the development of a research programme, we do not expect the workshop to produce outputs which can offer direct and immediate impacts beyond the identification and refinement of key science goals for a major funded research programme.

The expected output from the scoping activities will be the identification of 3 or 4 major scientific questions in areas in which the UK's scientific and technical communities are world-leading and where we are on the brink of transformative science. Answering these questions would become tractable with RP-scale investment and would result in a significant step change in terms of understanding our planet's path to, and maintenance of, habitability. Substantial impacts would be expected to emerge at this stage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26180</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Volatiles, Geodynamics and Solid Earth Controls on the Habitable Planet</gtr:description><gtr:id>A9B564D0-9B93-4691-BDFE-6CA780967F93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NERC call for consortium grant proposals for Earth System theme on volatiles and the habitable planet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9dcda7ab9dcda8e-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Knowledge, ideas and contacts were shared between all.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This grant built a new collaboration between myself at Oxford with collaborators listed below at the Universities of Bristol, Durham and Manchester in order to produce the report above and submit it to the NERC theme leader.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings went into the design of a programme level research call by NERC.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D7013F75-A0A8-4502-AC92-7ECA37E41A93</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54254ae5b08d91.94736232</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was 1 of 8 separate scoping projects approved by NERC, with the community coalescing around two broad themes. This scoping studying was one of 5 that fed in to producing a report and finally TAP4 proposal, currently with NERC's SISB, under the title Volatiles, Geodynamics and Solid Earth Controls on the Habitable Planet.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This 'blue sky' research program contains several themes with clear impact outside academia. These include the fundamental science of reactive flow in the earth that underlies part of this theme action and remains a cutting edge problem in the Earth sciences; and the broadening of our understanding of the deep Earth's role in the carbon cycle. Advances in multiphase reactive flow join with physics to contribute to our understanding, for example, of: how melts migrate and move in the crust; volatile transport; and how crustal fluids flow and interact with different reservoirs. These find immediate use in (volcanic) ore deposit exploration strategies and developing volcanic hazard assessment advances, but this science also finds application in non-volcanic crustal fluid systems such as water resources, geological storage of CO2 and oil/gas production and exploration. Training a significant cohort of doctoral and postdoctoral scientists in the latest science and technology in this field will be a significant impact that will benefit the UK environmental and resource industries. If successful the integrated Research Programme detailed for TAP4 will create an excellent opportunity for international partnerships with other large programmes including the NSF Geoprisms and CIG (Computational Infrastructure and Dynamics), and to utilize the data and model products of these programmes. In addition there is an exciting opportunity for a partnership with the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), seed funded by the Sloan Foundation with $50m over 10 years. The DCO has a particular goal of developing partnerships and community networks with other programmes to advance research in and attract further funding to this area. Leaders of Geoprisms, CIG and DCO have been involved in the scoping study for this Research Programme and all have offered their enthusiastic support.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0E24769B-4F81-4425-AB04-77B907C7839A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7587502168.107314776d513e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/J020397/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C6842010-EC71-44DF-B79C-64B1BA9B3BDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mantle &amp; Core Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>052183D5-AB83-4C5E-97FA-7B0C1D4AF3FA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Volcanic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
