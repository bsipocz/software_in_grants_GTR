These are thriving centres of pilgrimage for different faiths, attracting thousands of devotees at festival times. A rapid growth in tourist numbers has exacerbated the stress on infrastructure. The research will focus on the role of the beliefs and associations, ritual processes, and behavioural patterns of devotees and visiting pilgrims, in order to establish these as crucial factors in the design and conservation of public spaces with religious significance. The primary objective is to create prototypes of digital tools to contain images and information about the city, its history and heritage and, most importantly, to allow reflection, exchange and dialogue among different groups. The tools to be developed will be based on an interactive map of the historic areas as whole, and 3-d interactive scans of key public spaces. Once the basic work on these has been done, an interdisciplinary workshop with participants from India and the UK will be held in Ajmer. This workshop will be the starting point for the continuing network. Relevant public bodies and community representatives will take part. Varied expertise and perspectives will help to refine the tools, and the methods for gathering further data on differing perceptions of the city and on the activities within its spaces. The interactive models will be put online to be supplemented and critiqued. Findings from the study will be fed to the relevant authorities, and it is expected that the tools and approach will be applicable in historic cities throughout India, and worldwide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The simultaneous occupation and interpretation of spaces by different groups is a universal condition of pubic space within historic urban areas. This intense and specific study will be used to explore the potential for more qualified judgements to be made in such contexts. 

The potential for interactive interfaces to contribute to better planning decisions has been a long held ambition. Today, the greater availability and access to handheld media offers the opportunity to play out such ambitions. It would potentially be a protypical &amp;quot;Serious Game&amp;quot; interface for the contemplation of planning decisions. The emphasis of the research here, is however, not on developing the technology, but on developing the methodology and upon testing the actual value of persuing such lines of inquiry for the implementation of design decisions. The technology deployed is already in common usage, the dialogue between citizens and planning authorities remains fractured. 

The potential for the better communication and deliberation of both historic and current practices to contribute to the formulation of better strategic decisions should be obvious. Nevertheless, it can be inestimably difficult to balance or take account of such factors given the restricted periods for consideration and restricted channels for consultation. This project is a pilot and as such its pathway to impact is to develop a prototypical approach. The successes and failures of which have potential to be transformative in the context of these complex contexts but also as exemplars for deployment in paralell conditions of multifaceted urban conditions.

The following bodies are expected to participate in the mid-February workshop: Municipal Corporation of Ajmer, Pushkar Municipal Board, Superintendent Archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India Jaipur Circle, Rajasthan State Archaeology Department, Rajasthan Local Self Governance Department, Town Planning Department, local INTACH Chapter (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritge), Temple Trusts, Dargah Committee.

The following engagement activites are planned, to initiate communications of the project findings to relevant groups:

Meeting with Ministry of Urban Development for policy level recommendations at national level

Meeting with Town Planning Department and local bodies in Rajasthan to integrate methodology in future planning.

Meeting with Municipal Corporation of Ajmer and Pushkar Municipal Board in implementing the design recommendations in association with locals

An exhibition of the work will be mounted by DRONAH in association with HCN (Indian Heritage Cities Network)-UNESCO at Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur

Meeting with IHCN (Indian Heritage Cities Network)-UNESCO New Delhi, for policy level recommendation from the research to be presented at 'Habitat III&amp;quot; UN Habitat Forum in 2016 and to UNESCO, Paris.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30516</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>DRONAH Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Project partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>44D0F924-1ED7-4532-8180-E39F1D5027F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These are the outcomes of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beabe0f0e963.08444004-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Shikha Jain (Co-Investigator) directed the research team based with DRONAH, co-ordinate the workshop organisation, and set up a programme for dissemination to statutory bodies and community groups, as well as further workshops.

An exhibition of the project findings will be held in Ajmer in April. While the expected impact of the project will be chiefly after these events, we can already point to two small instances of impact. At the urban level, recommendations by DRONAH for certain ritually important areas to be pedestrianised are to be implemented by the Ajmer municipality. At the individual building level, the owner of a gota (embroidery) factory installed in a historic haveli with mural paintings, has already acted on advice for protection of the structure.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3D40D9D0-644E-40EB-9E99-F1570D42C781</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c000b78e4590.96304384</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has reinforced our initial conviction that cultural and religious rituals and festivals need be understood for socially inclusive design of urban spaces in historic Indian cities. To this end we have developed a website (still in progress, and expected to be operational by late March 2017) displaying two digital tools, intended to be prototypes. The first is an interactive map of the historic area of Ajmer. This is linked to an account of the historical development of the city, and incorporates textual, photographic and video material, including virtual tours of important streets, interviews, and mapping of ritual activities. The second is a 3-d scan of a chowk (street intersection) and havelis (courtyard houses) in a bustling and complex quarter of the old city. An unexpected finding was that the 'visual noise' resulting from the bustle of human activity added a dimension inviting deeper interpretation.

The online presence of this material is intended to generate comment and critique, to be acted on by DRONAH, one of the project partners, through its involvement in the Government of India's HRIDAY programme (Heritage Rejuvenation Development and Augmentation Yojana). DRONAH is using the research findings as a focus for discussions with relevant government bodies (Ministry of Urban Development; Government of Rajasthan) on city specific policies for inclusive and sustainable heritage conservation planning in Ajmer. 

A contribution of the historical research has been the identification of medieval temple fragments in Ajmer, Pushkar, and the temple site of Ajaypal in the hills between the two, giving a insight into the sacred lanscape of the region between the 8th and 12th centuries CE. Documentation of architectural fragments at the Arhai-din-ka-Jhopra mosque site, in the Aqbari Qila museum, and in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, will enable an informed graphical reconstruction of temples in the city's medieval sacred centre.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Apart from the plans to pass on the findings to the relevant authorities, for implementation and to inform policy, the tools and approach are intended to provide a model that can be applied in other historic cities in India, and indeed beyond.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BA268C01-79FA-49F0-876F-4F7796DF1653</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bffd0f6d2667.26843440</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.prasada.org.uk/ajmer-pushkar/index</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to develop methods for enhancing interaction between occupants, developers and planners in a city that has almost no accurate maps. This aim to develop community participation in conservation management has a significant legacy in both theory and practice. Here rapid prototype models, both physical and digital were used to record participant contributions, oral histories and over-layered timetables. The aim to transcribe these to a 3D model for public consultation was tested in the context of a small 'Chowk' or public node in the city. The extent of the space leads from a crowded road intersection surrounded with shops and businesses, through courtyards of an adjoining nineteenth century 'Haveli' or courtyard house and beyond that to its private shrine. Ethnographic methods were also used to collect data, and architectural conventions to model and map it.</gtr:description><gtr:id>98CFFBB4-1285-4049-9BEE-B848C62CC7FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See main impact section.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0205502ce72.19970046</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Rapid Mapping for Public Consultation in Heritage Planning</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.prasada.org.uk/ajmer-pushkar/index.php</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E50ABD70-0411-477F-8ABE-EC5750522E6F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Project website: The historic city of Ajmer-Pushkar: mapping layers of history, use and meaning for sustainable planning and conservation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/89f612f97a3241089e5e00f8ec8a5f42"><gtr:id>89f612f97a3241089e5e00f8ec8a5f42</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hardy, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bea47ac7a882.53186330</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9E9194CF-B9E7-482D-A400-180567F2E2C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conservation of Early Indian Mosques: The Arha'i-din-ka Jhompra Masjid, Ajmer</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/293ef77ca637527c858d7fcf7831d47b"><gtr:id>293ef77ca637527c858d7fcf7831d47b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kawathekar, V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be9744786b83.73367621</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E238BF1D-4B85-4D9D-B70C-042D9D17224F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Streamlining Urban Initiatives: Ajmer</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Context</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b7e8ee706e72bf8ad780a6e4f8bf05af"><gtr:id>b7e8ee706e72bf8ad780a6e4f8bf05af</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Agrawal, U</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bda18ce1cb53.29258325</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0D8E29F-DB84-4AD1-BD7B-0B3E978E4611</gtr:id><gtr:title>Braided on the Image: Ritual depiction and continuous fabrication at Ajmer</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8260d4d780b62c1be5eed2dc3ac69b5b"><gtr:id>8260d4d780b62c1be5eed2dc3ac69b5b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prizeman, O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be966a0e82c9.91167787</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>727BED6F-2FA1-42CC-8FE3-53951B882746</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring a Prototype for Urban Spaces in Response to Cuiltural Practices: Linking HRIDAY and AHRC-ICHR Research in Ajmer</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f18648016dba194614e0a2309f5b4106"><gtr:id>f18648016dba194614e0a2309f5b4106</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jain, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be98255dcad2.03483040</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9CDDF4FE-695A-4061-8A8E-A49AA6D7F67E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contemporary Conservation Practice in India</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f18648016dba194614e0a2309f5b4106"><gtr:id>f18648016dba194614e0a2309f5b4106</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jain, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be8f4d937c16.46866153</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7794EB61-AD9F-4A5B-AABF-74D8D39B4F4F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rapid Mapping and Visual Noise: Recording for the Visitor, Resident, Pilgrim and Tourist;
