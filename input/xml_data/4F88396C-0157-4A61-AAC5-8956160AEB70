Molecular dynamics is so frequently used to calculate the dynamic behaviour of proteins at the atomistic level firstly due to the large number of protein crystal structures that are publicly available in the Protein Data Base, but also because this methodology is well established, and excellent software packages are freely available to the academic biomolecular sciences community. However, we are still far from simulating cellular dimensions and time scales of entire biological processes. This will not be solved by hardware improvements in the foreseeable future, especially as the continuous increase
in computational power is slowing and may come to an end. As a consequence, new methodologies are needed to reach longer time- and length-scales.

This fellowship proposes to join two cutting edge methodologies in coarse-grained protein modelling to overcome this situation. Specifically,
 I will work with the Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis that models proteins as a non-rigid continuum subjected to thermal fluctuations, and the Multi-Scale Coarse-Graining method that aims to describe simplified molecular interactions using a physically-based bottom-up approach.

Once this methodology is ready, I will implement it within a scalable piece of software suitable for High Performance Computing, and will use this new tool to simulate the fibrin network self-assembly process, one of the key events in clot formation. This is a highly important biological system, as in vivo imbalance is related to a number of human pathologies, including heart and brain infarction. Structural data on the clot architecture has been shown to correlate with clinical data on cardiovascular diseases.

I will use currently available experimental data to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed methodology and software. Next, further simulations will shed light on association pathways and affinities leading to fibrin polymerisation, on the process of lateral aggregation of protofibrils, on the role of each of the known interaction sites, on the influence of the external flow, and on the effect that some pathological mutants have on the self-assembly process and the final structure of the clot.

Full accomplishment of these objectives will result in significant advances in biomolecular modelling methodology, together with the release of a general purpose application for biomolecular simulations on the mesoscale, and medically relevant results on the clot formation process and structure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will produce three main deliverables. Firstly, there will be simulation results revealing the mechanisms of the molecular basis of fibrin clot formation. Secondly, a scalable piece of software to simulate proteins at the mesoscale will be released. And thirdly, physics based methodology on protein-protein interaction modelling. The impact of these deliverables will target the Healthcare sector, essentially through pharmaceutical industry. The implicit generality of methodological research will enable me in the future to consider applications such as the discovery of new bio-materials and the design of vehicles for drug delivery. Both of these areas of biotechnology are active areas of experimental research at Leeds.

Understanding fibrin clot formation has direct clinical implications in bleeding and thrombotic complications of several diseases. For instance, commonly used medications to prevent thrombosis have turned out to have secondary effects on the final structure of the clot, resulting in a susceptible to lysis clot. On the contrary, there is a new generation of specific drugs that target and modulate the so called &amp;quot;knob-hole&amp;quot; interactions (see fig. 2 in the case for support), mostly avoiding such secondary effects. While the importance of these interaction sites have been revisited, the proposed research will be able to assess the consequences that the modulation of all the interaction sites involved in the fibrin self-assembly process, have on the overall mesh structure.

International pharmaceutical companies that can be potentially interested in the fibrin results include Enzyme Research Laboratories, GEHT, George King Bio-Medical Inc., Haematologic Technologies Inc., and Biopur while others like BAYER, novo nordisk, Grifols, Kedrion Biopharma, Octa Pharma, Immucor are known to have R&amp;amp;D departments more generally focused on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. More generally, in silico methods like Virtual Screening have been crucial to decrease the costs of the pharmaceutical research. The software and methodology proposed to parameterise the interactions will extensible to other protein systems, with applicability in the pre-discovery phase to obtain new compounds. In addition, it could be used to expand the amount of known targets, as currently 50% of them belong to 4 families: GPCRs, nuclear receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, voltage-gated ion channels. In a next future, it could be applied to model and design drug delivery liposomes, both with specific surface ligands, as well as with the desired rhelogical properties. In summary, the deliverables of the proposed fellowship will become directly relevant to the drug research and hence of interest for pharmaceutical industry.

As published in Forbes[1], the pharmaceutical industry destroyed nearly 300,000 jobs in the 2000 to 2011 period, and their efficiency in R&amp;amp;D has been declining during decades, with the number of new drugs per billion US dollar being reduced by a factor of 80 since 1950[2]. With an ageing society, increasingly dependent on new medicines, this has become a public major concern as is reflected in the EPSRC Healthcare
Technologies theme. The proposed research is an excellent exponent of the impact that basic research has on the health and quality of life.
