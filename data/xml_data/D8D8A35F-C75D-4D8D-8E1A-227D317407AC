cold-atom-based gravimeters and gravity gradiometers as a replacement for current instruments that are based on
classical technologies. In the initial phase of this work, our objective is to develop a roadmap for commercializing this next
generation of quantum-based gravity meters and identifying a viable path for transitioning the relevant quantum
technologies out of academic settings and into commercial venues.
Gravity sensors are used in a wide variety of markets, including oil, gas, and mineral exploration; positioning, navigation,
and timekeeping; cave and tunnel detection; geology and volcanology; and archaeology. Each of these applications comes
with its own set of performance specifications, risks, and market opportunities. Our roadmap will analyze all of these
factors, identifying which applications should be targeted for the greatest likelihood of success.
By the end of this initial work effort, we will have assembled an appropriate set of stakeholders, including end-users and
potential customers. With this groundwork laid, the next steps will focus on system design and R&amp;amp;D, including prototype
demonstrations and breadboard-level tests that fully demonstrate the feasibility of our technical approach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Technology Supply Chain Partners: quantum gravity sensors will develop and utilise a number of key technology
components including: vacuum chambers, laser systems, optics, control systems, data processing and inversion etc... The
roadmap will identify how these components need to be developed to fulfil the requirements for quantum sensors, thereby creating opportunities to create innovative and differentiates technology offerings and eventual leading to new markets for
application (gravity sensors and wider quantum technology applications). The consortium includes M2 Lasers who are
suppliers of laser systems; and will seek to engage with strategic partners for the other technology areas.
Sensor / System Integrators: the technology components will be assembled into novel gravity sensors. Different enterprises
may integrate the components in different ways to achieve different performance specifications. System integrators will in
turn integrate the gravity sensors into system platforms that deliver novel features and functionalities. The roadmap will
identify performance requirements and research approaches for a range of end-user applications thereby informing (and
accelerating) the development strategies of such sensor and system integrators.
System end-users: quantum gravity systems demonstrate performance gains for a wide range of applications, such as
defence (navigation, tunnel detection, battlefield imaging), geophysics (oil prospecting, void / feature detection, utility
mapping), civil engineering (infrastructure mapping) etc... In the long term such systems have the potential to deliver highly
disruptive solutions that: i) lead to the creation of new markets; ii) satisfy currently un-met user needs; or iii) achieve
performance gains far beyond existing solutions. The consortium will engage with end-users to: i) inform them about the
features of quantum gravity sensors; ii) to explore potential end-use applications; and iii) to define a roadmap for take up
and use; thereby providing competitive advantage against global competitors. Early adopters are anticipated within the
defence and geophysics sectors (both sectors that currently use gravity sensors).
Benefits to society
Quantum technology is a disruptive technology with the potential to create new markets and business growth, leading to
UK employment, economic growth and wealth creation. Gravity sensors are one type of quantum technology and the
feasibility project represents an important step along the road to realising these benefits in the medium to long term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CQ M2 Feasibility</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D7978DD-8D1A-42C8-84EB-963AE0E170CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop on market potential for cold atom gravitmeters.
