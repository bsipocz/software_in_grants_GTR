In Northern Ireland, the law is still as it was in Britain before the 1967 Act. But Northern Irish women still have abortions; if they can afford it, they travel to England and pay privately for a legal abortion. But every year, hundreds of women who cannot afford to go to England buy pills over the internet to cause a miscarriage - what is known as a &amp;quot;medical abortion&amp;quot;. These are the same pills that are used in about half the NHS abortions in Britain. This study will talk to women in Northern Ireland who have a medical abortion illegally, and women in Scotland who have it legally through the NHS. 

The study will find out, through being part of the NI Life and Times Survey, about what public opinion really is on abortion in Northern Ireland, including whether they think women ought to be threatened with prison for taking pills which are available on the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales. We will look at where the &amp;quot;social harm&amp;quot; occurs because of these illegal abortions. Is the social harm caused by the women taking the pills or is it caused by the state that won't allow her to do it legally? As part of the research, a sexual health expert will look at the women's experiences and see what kind of aftercare, advice about contraception etc that the Northern Irish women get, compared with the women in Scotland who got the pills from the NHS. 

The questions we hope the study will answer are:

What are the different experiences of women taking the abortion pill legally on the NHS (in Scotland) and illegally via the internet (in Northern Ireland)?
What impact does the illegal nature of such abortions in Northern Ireland have on the sexual and emotional health of the women concerned?
What do these different experiences tell us about the 'social harm' surrounding the UK's abortion laws?
What is the true state of social attitudes in Northern Ireland in relation to abortion?
What would decriminalisation mean for women (and abortion providers) in Northern Ireland and Britain?

It can be risky to do research on issues touching on illegality and the issue of abortion is a particularly controversial one but the research team has thought about how it will protect the women who have acted illegally, as well as our research.

The study hopes to cast new light on existing policy around abortion in the UK, especially Northern Ireland. It will seek to give policy makers new information on which to base their policies, and evidence which might open a debate about whether the UK, like Canada, should have no criminal laws associated with abortion. 
 
The project team will produce more than just a final report. We will write policy briefs aimed at policy makers, the medical profession and women's and voluntary groups at local and national level. We will also send information about what we learn to the United Nations committee that oversees women's rights. Some of the summaries we write will be aimed at the general public and we will present papers at conferences and seminars, and any events to which we are invited.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>IMPACT SUMMARY

The comparative qualitative study of women in Northern Ireland who have a medical abortion illegally, and of women in Scotland who have it legally through the NHS and clear evidence about the true state of social attitudes in Northern Ireland in relation to abortion should be of significant interest to a range of non-academic research users, including:

Health Professionals
Currently, there is little knowledge about the impact of illegal abortions via the internet. This study will help make GPs, Accident and Emergency personnel, sexual and public health professionals generally aware of the issue, and provide evidence on which to base decisions, thereby improving the chances of proper aftercare for women who illegally self-induce.

Policy Makers
Policy makers in Northern Ireland and across the UK need more evidence on which to base policy developments. The research team have excellent links with civil servants and other policy makers in Northern Ireland and will work closely with Voice for Choice in London to ensure that policy makers at Westminster and Holyrood also make use of evidence produced by the study.

The Women's Sector
While the women's sector in Northern Ireland and Britain is aware that there are illegal abortions via the internet are happening in Northern Ireland, there is very little information on them, apart from the Open Letter published in the media in March 2013. This has an impact when civil society organisations re responding to Department of Health or Department of Justice consultations and submitting evidence to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and other International Treaty Bodies. For example, when the a number of women's organisations made a submission to the CEDAW committee asking for an inquiry, under the Optional Protocol, into reproductive rights in NI and cited the growing number of illegal abortions as a concern, the committee asked for more information on how this affected women's lives. However, no evidence was available, a situation that the study can redress.

International Treaty Bodies
A number of International Treaty bodies have commented on the situation in relation to abortion in Northern Ireland. For example, the CEDAW committee has consistently asked the UK Government (in its 1999, 2008, 2013 recommendations to the UK) to undertake a process of public consultation on abortion in NI. This study will aid the committee by providing evidence on social attitudes in the region. Other International Treaty Bodies including the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have also expressed concern at the lack of evidence in relation to reproductive rights in Northern Ireland. 

The General Public
There is strong popular interest in discussion of any aspect of abortion and this interest should make it easy to gain popular media dissemination for this research. Given that abortion is increasingly a policy issue in Northern Ireland, the public needs more information on which to base its views. Relevant Radio 4 programmes will be approached with a view to securing interviews (e.g. Woman's Hour; Thinking Allowed) and, in the research team's experience, invitations to speak on local BBC radio and the world service should follow from these appearances. Further, in order to make the research more widely accessible, at least one article will be written for a broadsheet newspaper (e.g. Guardian news section, Society or Family supplement), as well as for a number of online forums, such as Opendemocracy and Mumsnet.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199848</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>That, as expected, ethical issues take considerable time to be cleared.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to say</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0C5A41E8-1B0D-4839-90B7-49EA4DB4943A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c938331e7ad3.79694113</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N007409/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
