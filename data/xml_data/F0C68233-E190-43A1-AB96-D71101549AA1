Melanoma is the 6th most common cancer in the UK and advanced melanoma still has a very poor prognosis (www.cancerresearchuk.org). In 2016, approximately 13,300 people in the UK will be diagnosed with melanoma. At current rates, approximately 2,100 of these will die from the disease. Thus, there is a need for a better understanding of this disease to ultimately facilitate better cures. 

Remarkably, most people carry the earliest detectable skin lesions as precursors to melanoma, in the form of benign human nevi or moles. Moles typically carry one of the genetic alterations known to drive melanoma, either an activated NRAS or BRAF oncogene. However, moles only very rarely progress to melanoma because the melanocytes harboring the oncogene are prevented from proliferating by a process called cell senescence. Consequently, a better understanding of senescence in melanocytes can aid in understanding the body's natural defences to melanoma. Eventually, this might be harnessed in therapies. 

One molecule critical for cell senescence and preventing tumor formation is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRB). As its names suggests, this molecule was first discovered through its ability to prevent retinoblastoma, a cancer of the eye. However, pRB also contributes to suppression of melanoma and many other cancers, in part through activation of cell senescence. Thus, it is important to understand control of pRB. We have discovered another molecule, called LNC98, which is required for cells to produce pRB. This in turn suggests that LNC98 might suppress melanoma formation. Consistent with this idea, we have found that LNC98 is inactivated in some human melanomas, perhaps accounting for their unrestrained growth and proliferation. 

In this study, we will investigate the molecular mechanism by which LNC98 promotes production of pRB in cells and investigate the role of LNC98 in suppression of melanoma. Completion of these studies should provide new therapeutic avenues to manage and treat melanoma.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The earliest apparent human melanocytic neoplasms are normal benign nevi (moles), which result from proliferative expansion of oncogene-expressing melanocytes. Like melanoma, virtually all nevi harbor mutations in N-RAS or its downstream effector, BRAF. But, typically, benign nevi do not progress to melanoma. At least in part, this is because cellular senescence blocks further proliferation of the melanocytes. Cellular senescence is an irreversible proliferation arrest that is activated by various molecular triggers, including activation of oncogenes (oncogene-induced senescence (OIS)), such as BRAF and N-RAS, in primary human cells. Activation of the pRB tumor suppressor pathway is critical for onset of senescence, and inactivation of the pRB pathway promotes melanomagenesis. Inactivation of pRB or its known regulators is a frequent event in human melanoma and most other cancers. Hence, a better understanding of cellular senescence and its control by the pRB pathway in melanocytes can contribute to a better understanding of the origins of melanoma and other cancers. 
 Recently, long non-coding RNAs have emerged as important regulators of genome function in mammals. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts that do not fit into defined classes of known small RNAs (e.g. microRNAs) and structural RNAs (e.g. ribosomal RNAs). In a recent screen, we identified many lncRNAs that are robustly upregulated during BRAFV600E-induced senescence of primary human melanocytes. One of these lncRNAs, ENST00000430998 (LNC98), is necessary for robust expression of pRB in senescent cells. We will investigate the role of LNC98 in control of pRB, cell senescence and suppression of melanocyte transformation through two Objectives : 

Objective 1. Investigate how LNC98 is upregulated in senescent melanocytes.

Objective 2. Investigate how LNC98 controls expression of pRB and contributes to cellular senescence and suppression of melanocyte transformation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are several important impacts of this research. 

Excellence in UK scientific research community.
The mechanism by which LNC98 regulates pRB is currently unknown, so this work is likely to define a novel determinant of pRB function. This will bring new knowledge, expertise, prestige and funding to the UK scientific community. 

The pharmaceutical industry
This proposal investigates a new-found lncRNA as a regulator of pRB and tumor suppression. Components of the pRB pathway include genes mutated in hereditary cancer syndromes (pRB and p16), drug targets (cdk4), prognostic indicators (p16 in head and neck cancer), biomarkers of aging (p16) and targets for interventions to promote healthy aging (p16). 

Similarly, as a regulator of the pRB pathway, LNC98 has potential to be a marker of disease risk, prognosis or therapeutic intervention. For example, if we show that LNC98 promotes pRB expression by stabilizing the RB1 mRNA, this will raise the possibility of small LNC98 mimetics that recapitulate the LNC98/RB1 interaction and stabilize the RB1 mRNA. Such mimetics might synergize with cdk4 inhibitors to promote activity of unphosphorylated, tumor suppressive pRB. Recently, a cdk4 inhibitor made by Pfizer (Ibrance (palbociclib)) has been approved for use against advanced breast cancer. 

The general public
The pRB tumor suppressor pathway is the paradigm of tumor suppressor pathways, extending back to Dr. Alfred Knudsen's prediction of the existence of tumor suppressors based on mathematical modelling of retinoblastoma disease in children. Thus, the pRB pathway is an excellent vehicle for communicating scientific ideas, principles and methods of discovery to the general public. 

Policy makers
Similar to the general public, the pRB pathway is an excellent vehicle to explain to policy makers the principles behind cancer and how understanding these principles can be used in disease therapy (e.g. Ibrance (palbociclib) for use against advanced breast cancer), and therefore to win their support for continued funding of biomedical science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>540809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P00041X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
