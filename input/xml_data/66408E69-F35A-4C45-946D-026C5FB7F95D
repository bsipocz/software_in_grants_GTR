A patient can normally only receive his/her own cell and tissue grafts or transplants because foreign molecules on cells from other individuals causes these to be rejected by the immune system. This causes particular problems in patients with genetic skin diseases. For example, in blistering diseases the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) peels off from the lower layer (the dermis) because molecules that stick them together are not being produced. We cannot replace skin in such patients with their own genetically deficient skin cells. 
Besides skin epidermis, the body has other outer layers of cells, the general term is epithelia. Our novel idea is to turn other epithelia into epidermis. Using animal models we have discovered that it is possible to convert cornea (from the eye) and amnion (from placenta) into skin epidermis by associating them with cells from the skin dermis. Cornea and amnion are good choices because a) both have been used extensively in clinical studies in the past and b) both should elicit little or no rejection when grafted to a foreign individual. For this project we now want to convert human amnion and cornea cells into skin epidermis, first by growing them in the laboratory in cell culture, and then by grafting the human specimens into specially bred mice that have elements of their immune system missing and therefore do not reject human tissues. We also want to understand how the process of changing one cell type into another (termed reprogramming) comes about, since it is a crucial aspect of modern stem cell biology. Therefore we will look in detail at what molecules are switched on and off during this process, and also use a large scale molecular screening process to try and discover molecules that, at the moment, are not associated with these events.
This work will help us understand the molecular mechanisms by which cells change type. Clinically we will show that human cornea and amnion can be converted to epidermis, and serve as biomaterials for skin replacement and gene therapy of human skin diseases. Additionally, we will make progress towards the creation of engineered skins that contain skin appendages such as follicles and sweat glands - a holy grail for skin transplant surgeons and for institutions wishing to perform skin testing and experimentation without animals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Recently, we reported the first evidence for reprogramming of animal corneal epithelium into skin using adult cornea and embryonic dermis. Intriguingly, the cornea also gave rise to hair follicles and we found evidence that a new population of stem cells were sequestered in these newly formed appendages. Lately we have discovered that rodent amnion can also be induced to form skin and hair follicles. The possibility of defined reprogramming of different epithelia has prompted our laboratory to consider a novel approach to the production of new skin and skin appendages for human therapeutics. Rather than focusing on the identification and targeting of a stem cell in the skin, we have recently initiated a new line of experimentation aimed at testing the hypothesis that cells from other sources might be coaxed into becoming skin cells given the right microenvironment. Cornea and amnion are excellent candidate tissues for this purpose because both have been used extensively in transplantation studies in the past and both may have reduced antigenicity and elicit little or no rejection when allografted.
 To examine this idea we will initially use our animal model of epithelial-mesenchymal recombinants transplanted to the kidney capsule to determine the pattern and chronology of gene expression changes associated with the conversion of amnion or cornea into epidermis. Changes in differentiation and the molecular signalling effecting these changes will be investigated using immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis. We will also directly test whether cells from the new tissues have stem-like capabilities and characteristics. Following this, we will use a culture model to examine the same questions but with human cornea and amnion tissues. With this in vitro model we will also explore whether a range of inductive influences, cellular and non-cellular, are capable of altering human amnion and cornea differentiation. Based on these findings we will perform transplants to different mice recipients to test: a) whether human amnion and cornea can be converted into skin; and b) the immunogenicity of the altered tissues. 
A successful outcome would result in the development and refinement of techniques for conversion of human amnion and cornea into skin, together with a greater understanding of the molecular events underpinning these changes. This technology would provide a foundation for the clinical application of amnion/cornea derived skin in skin replacement and would have wide applications in the treatment of both inherited human genetic skin diseases and common acquired skin defects.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-05-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>364465</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Durham University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Maatta Lab</gtr:description><gtr:id>3ADD1C9E-C441-4AC1-BA8F-429DBD34AC57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication: 18664494</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>8CB542DAEFB-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This partner assisted with specialized knowledge relating to epithelial cell culture and cell biology.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We assisted this collaborator with specific know how and expertise in hair follicle biology.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Columbia University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Christiano Lab</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA037127-CC66-4ED7-9A24-E3E8EA805CFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has had a big impact on the training and experience of the researchers involved on both sides.
