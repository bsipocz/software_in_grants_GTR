It will function through a combination of face-to-face workshops and on-line communication tools. Its opening project, 'The Reception of Bodin', is designed to develop the participants' interactive capabilities in relation to a subject which itself warrants investigation by virtue of its importance in the field.\n\nJean Bodin of Angers (1529/30-96), polymath, seminal thinker and controversialist, was among the most significant writers of his time. Educated in law at a time of strenuous dispute in legal and philosophical studies as well as religious upheaval, he was active in French political and governmental affairs throughout decades of 'religious wars'. These turbulent circumstances furnish the background to his major works, with four of which the network will be especially concerned.\n\nThe network's aim in this initial project will be to enhance understanding of how Bodin used the ideas and information which he derived from his vast array of ancient and contemporary sources; and how his contemporaries and successors construed and applied the ideas which he expounded in the works in question. 'The Reception of Bodin' will thus be viewed from two perspectives: Bodin as himself receiver, and Bodin as communicator to recipients of ideas emanating from him in turn. \n\nThe project's success will depend upon sustained interaction among the network's members. Its opening workshop will aim to familiarise them with the Sakai collaboration environment to be used throughout the award's duration and beyond. The workshop will also couple explicit discussion and critical evaluation of relevant areas of hermeneutical theory with a briefing on pioneering research into the sources upon which Bodin drew. Such a procedure, with Bodin treated in effect as a prism in the transmission of knowledge and ideas, may be expected to yield a more precisely-focused and more penetrating appreciation of that process than more generalised approaches would seem likely to achieve.\n\nThe four works around which the network's deliberations will revolve are: the Method for the easy comprehension of history (1566); the Six books of the 'commonwealth' [or 'republic'] (1576); the Demonomania of witches (1580); and the Theatre of nature (1596). They concern a variety of subjects in the fields of humanist scholarship and jurisprudence, together with political, moral and natural philosophy. Scholars have tended to deal with them severally as distinct treatises, and their underlying intellectual interrelationships have never been assessed systematically. One of the network's main objectives is, therefore, to engage the participants in an integrated dialogue, with the aim vis-&amp;agrave;-vis this particular project of discovering how far Bodin's thought, considered in the round, may be deemed internally coherent. \n\nSuch are the range of Bodin's thinking, the turbulence of his political and complexity of his intellectual environment, and the differential international impact of his writings that an agenda of the kind proposed can be successfully pursued only on an interdisciplinary and international basis. This project depends upon bringing together a new group of experts in a variety of disciplines and from several cultural traditions, under the direction of a principal investigator experienced in promoting productive interaction between members of academic groups. Conversely, the exciting challenges which the project itself presents are vital to the network's own development and capacity to stimulate post-project collaboration. The participants' collective outputs will include making their findings accessible to postgraduate students and to the academic community at large by means of technologically-enriched resources, as well as producing an edited volume of essays and agreeing a programme of future collaborative research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30133</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G001111/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
