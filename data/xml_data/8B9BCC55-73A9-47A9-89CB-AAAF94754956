(KEWTE)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M006999/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In the context of global climate change, imminent need for energy security and environmental conservation, renewable energy is now considered an important element of a sustainable energy supply. The UK and Scottish Governments have set ambitious targets for power generation from renewable sources: 50% of electricity is to be generated from renewable sources in Scotland, and 15% of the UK's total energy consumption is to be from renewable sources by 2020. 

The UK has one of the richest wave &amp;amp; tidal energy resources in the world and is at the forefront of researching, developing &amp;amp; deploying this technology in challenging &amp;amp; energetic ocean environments. The industry's success depends on the natural environment (waves &amp;amp; tides), but often how wave &amp;amp; tidal energy devices interact with the environment is not well understood. Through decades of research UK scientists have gained substantial knowledge about our seas and a wealth of experience &amp;amp; data that could be translated and applied in support of sustainable wave and tidal energy generation. This project will create a common language between the UK research community and companies developing technology to harness ocean energy, and in doing so will support collaboration and information exchange between these groups, and with the UK government and industry regulators, to help maintain the ongoing growth of the industry.

While the UK is at the forefront of marine renewable energy development, the production of energy from the ocean is by no means limited to the UK. Indeed projects are being developed on almost every continent around the world which could be accessed by UK companies looking to develop overseas. Likewise, many international companies are interested in developing in the UK. Attracted by the UK's leading position in the field and our wealth of natural resources, some international developers have already secured a place at the wave and tidal energy device testing centres at EMEC on Orkney, and at Wave Hub in Cornwall. Many of the greatest challenges facing such developers, whether in the UK or abroad, is in understanding and managing the interaction of the devices with the environment. During this project the fellow will highlight worldwide hotspots for marine renewable energy development and identifying common environmental challenges around the world. A key objective is to identify, translate and apply world leading UK environmental research to help tackle these common challenges. This Fellowship will signpost international business to applicable UK research and help UK researchers form productive industry collaborations to increase the impact and uptake of their work. The project will highlight relevant research outputs in key challenge areas and summarize these in a series of Bulletins. These Bulletins will be made widely available and targeted to businesses and policy makers in order to increase environmental understanding and therefore reduce risk and costs to businesses associated with tackling environmental challenges. It is anticipated that this approach will encourage financial investment from the industry into the UK, and will give confidence to British companies looking to grow and develop overseas.

Academic input into the wave and tidal energy industries can help to reduce the environmental risks associated with many developments in the UK. Subsequently, by reducing the cost of environmental impact assessments and uncertainty around the extreme offshore environments where these projects are situated, confidence in the sustainability of the sector will increase. This will undoubtedly encourage further investment, both from the UK and from abroad, often into the rural or remote coastal locations where the energy resource is greatest. The support and networking provided throughout this project can therefore help to create jobs and spark regeneration in these areas while sustaining an economically strong, world-leading marine renewable energy sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>105906</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AkzoNobel</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Biofouling partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>AFBDABE3-19B9-4003-9969-46194D1AA591</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Industry technical report: Marine Growth Monitoring and Mapping

We developed three parallel workshops around key issues in marine renewable energy: collision risk, fisheries interactions, and biofouling. I was personally responsible for organising the expert workshop on biofouling. We invited a wide range of participants, and on the day had 18 delegates, with an even spread of academic, industry, regulatory, and consulting backgrounds. The workshop aimed to address a series of linked ecologically and industrially relevant questions around marine growth on marine renewable energy devices. 

At the time of this submission, it is too soon to evaluate impacts, but certainly new collaborations will have developed, with anticipated outcomes around new investment. The group unanimously agreed on working towards establishing a network around the topic, as the key finding of the day was that new and effective pathways are needed to communicate knowledge between marine ecologists and renewable energy developers, such that they can make efficiency and operational gains, with economic impact.

The outcomes of this workshop were shared as part of the main ICOE conference programme, to a wider industry audience (see URL below).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb0b4a790c4.66116586</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.renewableuk.com/en/events/conferences-and-exhibitions/icoe-2016/side-events/environmental-interactions-of-marine-renewable-technologies.cfm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>POST Conference on Brexit and science (Westminster)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D9182B27-3D23-43B3-BF04-9BE33BC41A9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Attended the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology conference on Brexit as part of the NERC delegation.

Front-running companies went out of business, and others changed their business strategy. The government's policy changes posed challenges to investors. Numerous new organisations formed to support the industry from various perspectives, including the Offshore Renewables Joint Industry Programme for Ocean Energy (ORJIP), which addresses environmental impacts. Rather than work in parallel with these organisations, I have taken up a role in joining them together, supporting them by bringing together science and scientists under common initiatives. The main finding of the first year of my KE fellowship was that communication pathways across disciplines and groups were lacking. the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, an industry body, with my help, scoping, and signposting, working in-line with the ORJIP to establish projects with support marine renewable energy. Similarly, I have brought the MASTS Renewable Energy Forum closer to ORJIP, aligning priorities to building on what the NERC-funded MREKE programme has already achieved. 

In some areas, projects have been taken forwards in response to specific gaps I identified. For example, following the scoping study carried out by myself and Annie Linley (NERC) the ORE Catapult funded two feasibility studies based on environmental science: development of a collision detection device for tidal turbines, and technologies for monitoring and mapping marine growth. The former of these studies was carried out by CENSIS, who consulted widely within the marine science community, while the latter was carried out through a multidisciplinary collaboration across SAMS, PML Applications, and AkzoNobel. The latter study was highlighted by BBC News (Scotland), and in the ORE Catapult's Circuit magazine, and has since had substantial attention from the industry and research communities. Marine renewable energy device developers are becoming aware of how marine growth can affect the performance of their devices and the cost effectiveness of their operational practises, while environmental scientists have a better understanding of the needs of the marine industry.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B6242077-41C4-4E20-96EF-F54DE34A861F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56deb7da27c410.00031735</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Welsh wave and tidal energy demonstration zones workshop</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C5981A91-60A7-4C2B-BA64-E6C90B2E0487</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by Natural Resources Wales and the Crown Estate to participate in a two-day workshop to establish the regulatory approach to be taken towards environmental consenting of wave and tidal energy projects within the Welsh Demo Zones.
