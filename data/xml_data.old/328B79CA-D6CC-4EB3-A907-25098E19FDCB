While there has been detailed scholarship on medieval judicial imprisonment, and on the situation of prisoners of war, there has been no study of the various situations in which medieval people might be confined without having passed through a judicial process. This area is, however, crucial to an understanding of medieval law and its limits, of ideas of personal liberty in an age before articulated or agreed theories of freedom and rights, and of the inter-play between law and politics.\n\nI am looking, in particular, at two aspects of this area: (i) the non-judicial custody of women; and (ii) hostages in medieval law and practice.\n\nI have chosen to look at women's incarceration for three main reasons. First, legal historical studies, and particularly medieval legal historical studies, have often neglected women. Secondly, non-judicial confinement of women took different, and perhaps more varied and complex, forms than did non-judicial confinement of men, with family and dynastic issues to the fore, rather than personal offence or war. Thirdly, a study of non-judicial confinement of women gives a particularly good opportunity to consider informal as well as formal regulation in medieval England.\n\nThe following aspects will be examined:\n a) Confinement in conflicts\n b) Confinement during wardship or marriage, by guardians or husbands\n c) Confinement in the cloister: involuntary religious vows \n d) Confinement for 'idiocy' or other health conditions\n e) 'Criminal' confinements: abduction, ravishment, false imprisonment\n f) Women's other roles relating to confinement (resisting and refusing confinement of themselves \n or family members, trying to end captivity of family members, experiences in their absence).\n g) Legal controls on subjects and on kings in this area, particularly the nascent 'due process' \n rules and their limited applicability to women.\n\nIssue will be taken with some current studies in women's/gender history, which take a much more optimistic line on the lot of medieval women, and their agency, than appears justified by the many examples of their informal confinement. \n \nIt will be argued that the later medieval period (fourteenth and fifteenth centuries) saw a widening gulf between the increasing regulation of men's non-judicial incarceration - under the laws of war, and treason - and the continued convenient vagueness of the rules relating to custody of women. \n\n\nI move now to discussion of the second project, on hostages in medieval law and practice. There has been little work in England on the law and practice of hostage-taking, despite the importance of hostages in medieval warfare, and as security for international treaties, or the obligations of subjects to the king. A study of the taking and treatment of hostages would, therefore contribute to scholarship in medieval legal history, the early history of the rules and practice governing international relations, and medieval history more generally. \n \nParticularly worthy of study is the decline in English kings' use of hostages against their own subjects, from the early thirteenth century. This decline must be examined in the context of developing constitutional ideas, conflicting theories of kingship and the liberties conferred by Magna Carta. \n\nAlso of interest is the growing regulation of international treaty hostages in the fourteenth century, in the Anglo-Scots and Anglo-French conflicts.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6204</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H007083/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F067D65B-ECCC-4470-B65D-3D66E2CB0032</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Legal History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
