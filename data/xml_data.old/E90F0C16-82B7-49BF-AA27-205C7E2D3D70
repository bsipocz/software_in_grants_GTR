However, the different critical versions of metamodernism require refining, as although many critics agree that the more general term 'post-postmodernism' is not sufficient, they also disagree on the central aspects of metamodernism. Tim Vermeulen proposes that metamodernism attempts to account for the emergence of a wider 'structure of feeling' in the twenty-first century which responds to our historicity, bound up with the aftermaths of 9/11, the financial crash and austerity. Hence this new network provides a unique opportunity to formulate a timely and multidisciplinary response to what Linda Hutcheon has termed the difficult but urgent challenge of pinpointing a more exact 'label', and disseminating it to a variety of audiences, including academics working in the area of contemporary literature, culture and art, but also non-academics such as architects, creative writers, and avant-garde artists. The network will bring together leading international experts on the legacies of modernism for the first time in order to reflect on, and then define, the central aspects of metamodernism. The project crosses international boundaries in order to build new collaborations and forge a multidisciplinary response to metamodernism: academics will take part from across Europe (including The Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, Sweden and Poland), Japan and the United States; they will be from a variety of disciplines, including literary and cultural studies, American studies, women's studies, philosophy, sociology, film studies and fine art.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will impact the following groups in particular:

1, Members of the Manchester Modernist Society and visitors to the Anthony Burgess Centre, who are at the centre of the public events organised in association with the Manchester Modernist Society, including a public lecture on metamodernism, a metamodernist 'inquisition' event, and a round-table debate on metamodernism. After the events, those involved from the Manchester Modernist Society will be able to apply knowledge of metamodernism to the Society's particular interest in Manchester's built environment. These events have the potential to widen the members' specific interest in twentieth-century architecture to encompass the work of contemporary metamodernist buildings in Greater Manchester.

2, Audiences at the metamodernism art launch, and subsequent '96J' exhibition, at the Contemporary Six gallery in Manchester (July 2018). After a successful creative collaboration with a local artist (Colin Taylor) and Contemporary Six gallery in Manchester (Jan-Jul 2015), the PI is also working with Taylor on a metamodernist poetry/art exhibition with the curator Alex Reuben. Attendees - which included sixty local artists and writers in 2015 - will benefit from a greater understanding of how metamodernism can work in terms of the first artistic collaboration of its kind in the UK, and be able to apply such techniques to their own artwork, and creative research and writing.

3, On-line listeners at the national Poetry Archive (www.poetryarchive.org). The PI's new recording for the Archive will include metamodernist pieces influenced by the current critical project. Listeners will be able to understand the main tenets of metamodernist literature, which the PI explains in a short introduction to the poems, and appreciate the contemporary poems in the archive in a new way, comparing the legacies of modernism across the different archival recordings. 

4, On-line participants in, and listeners to, the Backdoor Broadcasting Company, Padlet and Adobe Connect, and readers of proposed articles and features in public facing publications and websites such as Radboud University's www.metamodernism.com., and alluvium.co.uk. The steering group will also take an active role in contributing to the online community discussions via Twitter to help initiate debate about metamodernism

5, The project will also result in engagement with the large retail, real estate and infrastructure company, Peel Group, in order to discuss the potential impact of metamodernism on everyday life in the form of architecture and consumer behaviour. This has the exciting potential to impact on the future development of the buildings, interior space and design in venues such as The Trafford Centre in Manchester.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38417</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007406/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
