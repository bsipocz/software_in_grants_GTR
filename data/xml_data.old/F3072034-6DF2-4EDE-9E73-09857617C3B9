The increased sophistication of measuring instruments (including satellites) and computer simulations means that researchers need to understand terabytes or petabyes of data. Visualization is a very important tool in extracting meaning from very large and complex datasets, because the human brain is extremely good at spotting features and patterns that a computer cannot.

Although most scientists use ordinary desktop computing facilities in their everyday work, these facilities are often inadequate for visualizing and analysing large-volume and high-resolution datasets. Therefore we propose to build a videowall consisting of eight high-resolution screens together with a powerful graphics workstation. This will allow scientists to visualize very large datasets and collaborate together to understand them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Industrial partners and policymakers will benefit from the ability to see visual representations of complex data (e.g. the effects of different climate scenarios), enabling them to understand better the conclusions that scientists have reached. We anticipate using the videowall system for outreach and knowledge exchange events. The University is involved in many activities connected with industrial collaboration (including TSB-funded projects, NERC Knowledge Exchange project and close interactions with bodies such as the Space Applications Catapult).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>217602</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Scientific research groups are using the facility in their own scientific meetings, to help them share data, discuss ideas and enhance their collaborations. In addition, the facility has been used to support several outreach activities, including filming for online courses (MOOCs) and television programmes (e.g. BBC). It has also been used for training activities, including a NERC short course on software development.

Perhaps most importantly in terms of impact, the videowall is an excellent tool for engaging external audiences (e.g. industry and policymakers) to show research results in an interactive and engaging manner. Numerous external visitors have been engaged in this way (e.g. Airbus GEO, European Space Agency, CABI, Defra, Yorkshire Water, many more).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5D7FB55E-D5C0-47FA-AF0B-89DC6591DD9F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463815ccfa398.02819462</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project was to build a new data visualization facility at the University of Reading. We built an 8-screen videowall, driven by a powerful computer, that enables scientists to present their data in an eye-catching and attractive way, and to explore their data to support their own research. We are hoping to enable a cultural shift in how scientists use visualization in their everyday work, by making visualization techniques more attractive, accessible and usable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In addition to the expected use of the videowall itself, we make our software available as open-source downloads. We have already had interest from other scientific groups in using this software. We have also had a number of enquiries from groups (including the NERC community) who want to install similar videowall facilities at their own institutions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FB741229-093F-4CD1-AF9A-BC3113C13118</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54637f84afb722.54936816</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/resc/home/facilities/videowall.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>To ensure that the maximum potential of the videowall facility is reached, we at ReSC have developed custom software for exploring and comparing 4-dimensional high-resolution datasets.
