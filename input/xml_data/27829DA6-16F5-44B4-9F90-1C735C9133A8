 Particle physics seeks to understand the nature of matter at the smallest scales and relate that knowledge to the behaviour of the universe at the largest scales. One of the main questions being addressed by experiments today is why the universe is made of matter and not antimatter. The standard model of particle physics links conservation laws with fundamental symmetries: the missing antimatter is connected to the violation of charge-parity (CP) symmetry---which says that the laws of nature should be the same for matter and for antimatter seen through a parity inversion, equivalent to looking at something upside down in a mirror. All known instances of CP violation are too small to account for the lack of antimatter, so experimenters are now searching for the origin of this using the elusive neutrino.
 Astronomical observations have shown us definitively that the matter we see makes up only a small fraction of the universe---just 5%! A significant fraction, 25%, is made up of enigmatic dark matter: massive particles that do not interact with light but do influence the world around us. The standard models of particle physics and cosmology predict that these dark matter particles obey the same laws of nature that normal matter does and so we can devise laboratory experiments to detect evidence of their presence. The leading theory is that dark matter is made up of heavy particles that interact via the weak nuclear force, just like neutrinos do. If so, then it should leave characteristic traces in terrestrial matter: atomic nuclei struck by dark matter particles will recoil with tiny amounts of energy. To test this hypothesis we build experiments designed to observe these tiny recoil energies. Because the rate of these interactions is small, and the recoil energy is tiny, we must build experiments at the cutting edge of particle detection technology to search for this weak signal.
 Many dark matter and neutrino experiments use cryogenic (very cold) noble liquids, such as liquid neon, argon or xenon, because of their stable atoms and excellent optical properties. In particular, these liquids emit large amounts of light when the dark matter particles cause nuclear recoils, and that light can be collected and interpreted readily to identify the type of particle that created it: nuclear recoil signal or an interaction of background radiation. Cryogenic noble liquid detector development is pushing the boundaries of particle detection, in a world-wide technology race to study the fundamental questions of the nature of neutrinos and dark matter. However the properties of light in these liquids is not very well understood, and therefore experiments must develop systems to initiate controlled &amp;quot;signals&amp;quot; inside the detectors that test the ability of the experiment to observe the signal, distinguish it from backgrounds and measure its energy correctly. This process is called detector calibration and it is where experimenters spend much of their effort.
 This proposal is to develop new technology for detector calibration and to make measurements of the optical properties of cold liquid argon, neon and xenon. Specifically, we will measure the attenuation lengths of light in these liquids; we will measure the angles that light is scattered into from the wavelength shifting films that must be used in cold liquids; and we will test the mechanical utility of certain designs for calibration devices. Once these measurements are made, the calibration of large, liquid noble detectors will be significantly improved, and we will be one step closer to identifying the nature of the puzzling dark matter that accounts for 25% of the universe, and understanding the mystery of the missing antimatter.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Refer to lead proposal by Royal Holloway</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18200</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Durham University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Associateship with IPPP</gtr:description><gtr:id>53CA5481-5866-45D7-8BD1-EBAAE2312BE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Internal LBNO note.

The program involves members of the department at all levels, from taught undergraduate and postgraduate students, research students, post doctorial researchers and faculty. We have a wide range of practical activities available to take out to local schools, which are boxed up with a detailed lesson plan for department members to take to take out or use on site. The majority of our outreach activities are linked to our research.
Our annual reach is to 5,000 students per year, working with approximately 800 primary school students, 3500 secondary student, and 700 A-level students, in addition to the 2,000 members of the general public that experience our events. We currently run 130 events per year, reaching school and college students at 60 different schools. We have both schools visiting the University of Sussex campus in Brighton, and we also go out to schools.
Around half of our events involve communicating the research carried out at the University direct to schools, colleges and the public.

25% of our events involve describing our particle physics research, usually consisting of a research talk (about the Large Hadron Collider, SNO+, etc) which is reinforced by practical activities (such as building cloud chambers, or visiting our research labs).

Every week during the school terms, we run a School's Lab day, where a group of students visit the University for as full day of experiments specifically designed for the GCSE, AS and A2 level syllabus. During those days, the students visit a research lab, and get the opportunity to talk with our research students about their work. In addition, visiting A-level students also have a research lecture, and get to here the latest research being done here at Sussex.

Every year, we offer masterclasses in particle physics, with one day aimed at GCSE students, and another at A-level. These days involve research-level talks, visits to labs, as well as hands on experimental experience.


We have developed links with local schools and colleges. Teachers frequently approach us to request research related outreach activities (talks, lab tours, practical activities), ask for advice or to borrow equipment for teaching. In 2013, we ran the Institute of Physics sponsored Physic Update weekend conference for teachers.

Since we began our outreach program, undergraduate numbers has risen significantly within the department, from an intake of 40 students in 2009, up to the current (and sustained) 140 students per year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>533450107efba9.37232098</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/outreach</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009,2010,2011,2012,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Junior Research Associateship (HW)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Sussex</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>461AC4B2-3B2A-4978-B565-277AA4A1C37E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>533091a0a549a3.77130134</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Junior Research Associateship (TB)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Sussex</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Talitha Bromwich</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>E1680BA7-BE28-4A2E-A9FB-F13D01972D56</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5330922da0ccd2.79460246</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The absolute light production and exact angular distributionn of TPB wavelength shifter.
