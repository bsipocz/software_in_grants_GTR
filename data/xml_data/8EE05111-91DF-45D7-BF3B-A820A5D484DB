This is achieved by building a model, written in mathematical language, that is simple to use yet contains all the essential information required to describe the system in question. For example, imagine we wanted to model the formation of sand dunes in a desert by using the information about each individual grain of sand. This would produce a model too complicated to understand and impossible to use. Yet, to build a successful model it suffices to exploit the fact that on the scale of a dune length that is much larger than an individual grain, sand appears to behave like a continuous medium. In this example, the mathematical model addresses the phenomenon in question by focusing on a single scale, the length scale of the individual dunes. To put it another way, the essential behaviour of the system on the scale in question (length of a dune) is not dictated by the behaviour on finer scale (size of a grain). This however is not the case for many phenomena of great significance today, for example protein folding, catalytic processes or corrosion of metals, where the essential underlying behaviour spans a wide range of length and time scales. 

As an illustrative example let us consider a typical Long bone in the body, whose primary function is to provide structural support under mechanical load. A particular phenomenon within Long bone is that its composition can change due to mechanical stresses applied over long time scales. This is achieved by the remodelling of bone to form patterns that are the most resistive and supportive to the changes in mechanical stress. This process begins with the mechanical load stimulating protein translation; the formed proteins then aid in the formation of vesicles and transporter molecules which finally deposit the minerals that form the bone. The complexity of the above explanation shows that for a mathematical model to successfully address the dynamical properties of bone it must include hierarchical behaviour that spans many time and length scales. This illustrates the fact that the simplest models of multi-scale phenomena are incredibly complicated and too difficult to use. The objective we face is to derive effective macroscopic models from complicated multi-scale models. This is where 'multi-scale analysis' and in particular the proposal comes in. 

The project will develop new tools in the study of multi-scale models in material sciences, with a focus on a new class of artificial materials called &amp;quot;metamaterials&amp;quot;. The role of these tools will be to extract macroscopic properties from multi-scale models of such materials while preserving the key information about the microscale in order to produce simple and accurate models for metamaterials. To achieve this goal I will cast the multi-scale models in question in the mathematical language of &amp;quot;operators&amp;quot; and by using recent advances in operator theory and multi-scale analysis provide a new analytical approach to describing the dominant behaviour of these operators (and, in turn, their model counterparts) resulting from the interaction of the different scales. The proposal will also make advances in the theory of homogenisation, which is a mathematical method used to find effective models of multi-scale systems. The proposal will exploit new advances in homogenisation theory to analyse a broad class of differential equations that model metamaterials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed work will make advances in the context of multi-scale analysis, an area of great importance in many aspects of modern science, medicine and industry, such as in the understanding and predicting the processes in metal corrosion, catalytic mechanisms and organ function. The fundamental mathematical component of this work is to understand the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes that produce such multi-scale phenomena. The mathematical tools developed from this study are likely to be of interest in multi-scale modelling, as they will be able to strictly identify the dominant small-scale behaviour in a given multi-scale process and provide a simplified large-scale model with stharp information about its accuracy. 

An equally crucial component of this proposal is the application of these novel tools to a class of emergent materials called &amp;quot;metamaterials&amp;quot;. These man-made composites are created to have desirable macroscopic properties by specifying its microscopic structure. The tunable macroscopic properties of metamaterials has lead to metamaterial-based products which are compact, light and more energy efficient than the existing counterpart devices in the commercial, civil and defence sectors. The importance of this emerging industry is further highlighted by noting that the UK government recently began to focus on maintaining the high-level of UK-based research in metamaterials (with increased funding in the &amp;quot;Photonic Materials and Metamaterials&amp;quot; research theme of the EPSRC portfolio). 

This proposal is poised to provide long-term benefits by deepening the understanding of the principles that underpin the development of metamaterials. This will be achieved by producing novel mathematical tools that accurately predict the macroscopic behaviour of a metamaterial with prescribed microstructure. Such studies will not only broaden the horizons of metamaterial applications but also provide the blueprints needed for their future synthesis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>221738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in ``Operators, Operator families and Asymptotics&quot; workshop, Bath 16-19/05/16</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96FC1C6A-35CD-4AF4-8767-98E4BA7E6D1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The conference will make an overview of the state of the art in a rapidly developing area of analysis concerned with application of the techniques of operator theory to the asymptotic analysis of parameter-dependent differential equations and boundary-value problems. From the physical point of view, the parameter normally represents a length-scale in the situation modelled by the equation: for example, a wavelength in wave propagation, or the inhomogeneity size in the theory of periodic composites. The theory of linear operators in a Hilbert space (symmetric, self-adjoint, dissipative, non-selfadjoint), which has enjoyed several decades of outstanding progress, had been, for much of its time, restricted to abstract analysis of general classes of operators, accompanied by ad-hoc examples and applications to perturbations of the Laplace operator. The meeting is aimed at making a step-change in re-assessing the existing body of knowledge in the related areas, as a modern operator-theoretic version of the classical asymptotic analysis. This will generate new research directions in the asymptotic study of operator families, where the abstract and applied streams are aligned with each other.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b83e37ab75.42967765</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/event/mon-16-may-16-0000/operators-operator-families-and-asymptotics</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in ``Young Applied Analysts in the UK&quot; workshop, Bath 26-27/05/16</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>444550FF-A601-46DF-AFEE-5C4FA51280C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main purpose of the meeting is to bring together early career researchers and PhD

This workshop focuses on partially ordered materials, somewhere in between the conventional solid and liquid phases of matter.


The workshop has three central themes: mathematics and modelling of:

 LCs and complex fluids
 bio-materials
 nano-materials and new technologies


All three themes involve partially ordered materials, singularities, challenging questions in dynamical evolution and offer possibilities for synergistic intra- and inter-disciplinary connections amongst mathematicians, theoretical physicists, experimentalists and engineers in the UK and India.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b72fd2b141.95157485</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://icms.org.uk/workshops/mmp</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in ``Metamaterials Beyond Photonics&quot; workshop at ICMS 20-24/06/16</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A42CDC64-9489-49CD-8437-679E0EA5FA2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A metamaterial is a synthetic inhomogeneous material with wave bearing properties that differ significantly from those exhibited by homogeneous media, due to its complex microstructure. The idea of being inhomogeneous materials to control and guide wave propagation is well established: for example the optical fibres used in the telecommunications industry are typically constructed by placing a cladding around a core with a higher dielectric constant. The aim of this meeting are to keep the UK at the forefront of developments in this rapidly developing field and to enable young researchers to meet and interact with established international experts. The workshop will bring together mathematicians, physicists and engineers to exchange ideas and contrast their different approaches to the theoretical and practical challenges that metamaterials present.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b6a36b5272.26512649</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://icms.org.uk/workshops/metamaterials</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in ``Computational and Mathematical Aspects of Maxwell's equations&quot; workshop at Durham 12-20/07/2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A17B70B-F7C7-4143-B265-2702FCE7CAFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This symposium will explore the mathematical problems associated with Maxwell's equations in several modern application areas:

1) Photonics and Resonances: This looks at the propagation of electromagnetic waves in periodic structures. Mathematical questions include the study of affects on the spectrum of the underlying operator resulting from the geometry or strength of perturbations to the periodic structure.

2) Metamaterials and Cloaking: Metamaterials are usually constructed by using repeated microscopic structures to achieve properties not observed in natural materials. These properties are usually achieved in some abnormal regimes, which can only be approximated in actual production processes. This provides difficult mathematical problems, such as analysing the rate of convergence of various approximations and defining the optimal way to approximate. Mathematical techniques include homogenization theory.

3) Inverse Problems in Electromagnetism: Many (medical) imaging techniques make use of electromagnetic waves. Recently, there has been much interest in so called mixed mode or hybrid imaging. Mathematical questions include: unique reconstruction of the image, development of reconstruction algorithms and reconstruction in the presence of incomplete data. One tool used successfully in this area has been harmonic analysis.

An additional focus will be the interface between analytical questions for Maxwell systems and results obtained using numerical methods, in particular novel numerical techniques based on new mathematical analysis, e.g. multi-scale methods which exploit ideas from homogenization, special methods which capture geometric and high-energy asymptotics, as well as the use of verified computations as a constituent tool in a formal analytical proof.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b60dd15fb2.44438986</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/events/Meetings/LMS/104/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participant of the 3rd SAMBa Integrative Think Tank.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>595B0CBD-5544-4779-B700-EAD394B6C580</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Integrative Think Tanks bring together students, academics and external partners over a week.
