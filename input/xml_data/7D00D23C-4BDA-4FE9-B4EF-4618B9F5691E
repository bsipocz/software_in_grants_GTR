It is built around a striking difference between the use of reflexive pronouns in Old French and Modern French. In the former, the stressed reflexive pronoun soi was widely available for any singular subject, e.g. devant soi voit ses enemis 'he sees his enemies in front of himself', whereas in the latter, the personal pronouns lui or elle are typically used for reference to the subject of the clause (clause-mate anaphora), except with some indefinite pronoun subjects such as on 'one' or chacun 'everyone'. The arguably far-reaching theoretical implications of this have not been appreciated, nor has the change itself been sufficiently charted.\n\nApart from offering descriptive insights into the history of the language, a detailed investigation of this is important for a number of current issues in theoretical linguistics. Firstly, diachronic change in anaphoric systems promises to further our understanding of those systems themselves, in particular with respect to Binding. Secondly, the proposed research has a very particular bearing on the currently much-discussed topic of specificity, for reasons to be explained below. Finally, a detailed investigation of a particular instance of grammatical change should advance our knowledge of grammatical change more widely.\n\nThis change is put here into the wider context of reflexive marking, intended as the grammatical expressions of identity of arguments within the same clause. The range of relevant expressions includes the clitic pronoun as in il se lave 'he washes', the stressed pronoun as in Anne est fi&amp;egrave;re d'elle 'Anne is proud of herself', and the stressed pronoun with m&amp;ecirc;me as in un &amp;eacute;go&amp;iuml;ste ne pense qu'&amp;agrave; soi-m&amp;ecirc;me 'an egoist thinks only of themselves'. \n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond the academic community proper, the proposed fellowship benefits at least three specific, partly overlapping, constituencies. \nFirstly, there is the global community of French speakers and learners. They benefit directly from research on the usage of intensifiers lui/elle-m&amp;ecirc;me, an area of French language use that is currently not sufficiently covered in descriptive grammars of the language, surprising as this may seem. Despite the high frequency of the construction and hence its importance in colloquial and formal speech alike, learners and teachers of French currently cannot access reliable information on its proper use. The proposed research project will remedy this situation by publishing, as part of its planned output, an article in an international journal targeted at French language teachers, with a view to providing clear, concise, and accessible information on the use of intensifiers. A suitable journal would be the Journal of French Language Studies. It is hoped that this will reach French language specialists across the globe and eventually filter through to the production of future descriptive grammars of the language. This promises to be a significant direct impact for decades to come, hence generating value for the UK taxpayer, without requiring any additional future expenditure beyond the funding now sought.\nSecondly, there is a strong interest in language in general and the French language and culture in particular in many parts of UK society. French continues to be the most widely taught and learnt modern language in the UK, this position being unaffected by the recent rise of Spanish and East Asian languages. Millions of UK citizens speak French, many of whom are keen to further their knowledge about the language. Moreover, language change, as dealt with in the proposed research, is a linguistic topic of interest and relevance to many in Britain, on a general level as well as specifically where French is concerned, given the many ways the istorical trajectory of the English language is intertwined with French. Scholarly work on language structure is not cut off from public interest in it and will arguably filter through to the cultural base of the wider public in the long term, thereby accruing significant civic capital for the United Kingdom.\nThirdly, the UK public and UK taxpayer benefit in the long term from the economic capital that is accrued with the publication of internationally excellent research by UK-based scholars. This contributes to the reputation of UK universities in general and UK-based French Studies and Linguistics in particular, attracts, with direct beneficial monetary effects, prospective students to UK higher education, increases business activity in domestic industries associated with Higher Education, and strengthens the UK's international standing more generally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60742</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In French, the reflexive pronoun soi has undergone progressive restriction of from all kinds of subject antecedents in Old French to non-specific pronouns and nouns. 

The theoretical framework of my study assumes a distinction between a grammatically and a discourse-structurally motivated pattern of anaphoric relation. Grammatically motivated anaphors relate to Binding, whereas discourse-structurally motivated anaphors are in the realm of coreference. This distinction is asymmetric, in that grammatical anaphors are also discourse ones simply by virtue of being subject to linear order. The increasing sensitivity of the reflexive / simple pronoun to the referential status of the subject prompted a discussion of specificity. I contrasted a mainstream discourse-oriented view of specificity with a predicate-oriented view of specificity. I then moved to a discussion of binding. I have argued again for Seuren's (1989) True Binarity Principle (TBP) as a motivation for special marking of reflexives. Moreover, I argue that reflexive and personal pronoun are fundamentally non-complementary. Any complementarity needs to be especially motivated rather than being taken as the normal case. 

I analysed the division of labour between soi and the personal pronoun in Contemporary Spoken French. Here, soi is used consistently with non-specific pronoun subjects as well as with non-specific full noun antecedents. In Written French, the use of soi diminishes dramatically against the use of the personal pronoun. This is partially offset, though, by an increase in the use of soi in non-anaphor contexts and by an increase in the use of soi with specific subjects in the 20th century in fictional texts. Soi's earlier preference for things (as opposed to human beings) reflects probably a referential-semantic distinction, specificity being the crucial criterion. I tracked the choice of clause-mate anaphors for a number of predicates that have been used from Old French until the present day. 

I also studied the relation of lui/elle and lui/elle-m&amp;ecirc;me predicates in French. I have argued that in lui-m&amp;ecirc;me, m&amp;ecirc;me is part of the predicate, rather than an argument. My analysis of the difference between lui-anaphors and lui-m&amp;ecirc;me-anaphors implies argument focus for the former and predicate focus for the latter. Diachronic analysis has not found evidence for a significant change in the division of labour between lui/elle and lui/elle-m&amp;ecirc;me-anaphors in individual predicates.

Moreover, intensifiers in French were studied. French lui-m&amp;ecirc;me / elle-m&amp;ecirc;me has, like its English counterpart himself/herself, three main functions: adnominal, adverbal-exclusive, and adverbal-inclusive. I discussed Siemund's (2000) analysis of the distinction between adverbal-exclusive and adverbal-inclusive and suggested that it cannot be located in propositional meaning alone. Rather, the contrast content-level vs. context-level (Hansen 2008) is a more promising analytical category. 

Finally, I turned to the possible causes and motives of the replacement of soi with lui/elle. I pointed out that this change echoes a number of other instances of secondary grammaticalization in the history of French. Moreover, the process supports the notion that the choice between reflexive and personal pronoun is a form of Differential Object Marking.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One of the project's findings concerns the use of French intensifiers lui-m&amp;ecirc;me/elle-m&amp;ecirc;me such as in 'le roi lui-m&amp;ecirc;me'. These are frequent in communication but have, to my knowledge, not been sufficiently covered in French descriptive grammars. The project's findings are thus relevant for language learning of French more widely.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8EFD5B46-36C3-4A71-8C0C-51CD41D63FBB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3591603258.244323777803f74</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>966272A8-0D09-4288-8E43-69F75883DBC7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reflexive marking in the history of French</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/75b4567fbb274c75dd7e3045aebb0c95"><gtr:id>75b4567fbb274c75dd7e3045aebb0c95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waltereit R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978 90 272 0594 0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5418122aea0438.88261557</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8206D52D-2C2D-4383-A66F-9CC5A93974EB</gtr:id><gtr:title>J'ai lu ce livre moi-m&amp;ecirc;me: On the synchrony and diachrony of French intensifiers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philologie im Netz</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/75b4567fbb274c75dd7e3045aebb0c95"><gtr:id>75b4567fbb274c75dd7e3045aebb0c95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waltereit R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b9d6f92be870.95215230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H034722/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>670B21EC-383C-4A51-856D-14A82FAE3EC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language Variation &amp; Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF570B48-CCF2-4278-BD44-F58AD6C36BDA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Syntax</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
