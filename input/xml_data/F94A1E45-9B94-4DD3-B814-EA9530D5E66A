Keys of modern cars can be cloned very easily. In-car security systems such as trackers are often compromised through the use of jammers. Just last year, hundreds of thousands of cars in Europe were stolen without forced entry.

To combat the rise of key cloning devices which are cheaply available online, MSR provides a solution, the security of which is not susceptible to key cloning and jamming signals. The MSR mobile app communicates with a hardware kit inside the car. As opposed to state-of-the-art immobilizer and other security solutions, MSR offers the following unique features:

? You can give temporary guest passwords to other people like mechanics, valet drivers, or family members.

? Changing car keys and getting new key copies is costly and time consuming. With MSR, accessing key copies via the app and changing your password is free.

? By law, car manufacturers are obliged to share information with authorized dealers, some of whom share this information with illegitimate persons. Thieves have learnt how to bypass all existing security solutions. MSR works as a stand-alone system and is not dependent on car's existing ECUs.

? The system's security features are interconnected so that if a password is hacked it cannot be used without the owner's authorisation.

Key Note's latest vehicle security market report shows that there is a huge opportunity for new product development. There are over one billion cars worldwide, 256 million in the EU. Even if car manufacturers come up with a solution for the problem the new solution will only be implemented for newly built cars; leaving millions of car in the aftermarket totally exposed. Car manufacturers knew about the flaws in their security systems and did nothing for a while because it was a logistical and technical nightmare. Users have been left to their own devices.&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49791</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">104105</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
