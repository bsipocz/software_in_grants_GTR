Much of this control is brought about by the activity of a class of molecules called protein kinases which interact with each other in complicated networks. Despite the complexity of the overall response, each individual kinase carries out a simple chemical reaction. By understanding the fundamental principles that govern this reaction and how it is regulated we can better understand the overall cellular behaviour.

Regulation of protein kinases involves activators and inhibitors. Many of these bring about their effect by modifying the shape of the protein kinase. One shape promotes kinase activity, another inhibits it and the details of this are already being studied in my laboratory. What we don't understand is what happens when activators and inhibitors act together on the same kinase molecule. The usual shapes induced by activators and inhibitors are so different that a single kinase molecule cannot adopt both at once, but the evidence for what happens instead is weak and contradictory.

In this work we will address this question directly for the first time. We will develop a new method and monitor the number of different shapes adopted by an example kinase in solution. From this we can determine whether there are two populations of kinase in solution (one modified by activator, one modified by inhibitor) or one population modified by both (in which either activator or inhibitor must change how it interacts with the kinase). This is important in understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern cellular behaviour. It also opens the way to using inhibitors to probe kinase complexes in cells. Finally, this work is directly applicable in drug design: kinase inhibitors are shape-specific and this work will enable medicinal chemists to be certain that they are designing inhibitors against the most appropriate shape of the kinase. It will also enable them to decide whether they should design certain classes of inhibitor at all for some kinases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Protein kinases control and coordinate of many of the cell's vital processes. They are activated by phosphorylation (often by other kinases) and by the binding of protein partners. These latter often increase kinase activity by promoting a conformation of the kinase optimised for catalysis. In contrast to this, many kinase inhibitors gain their specificity by promoting a particular inactive conformation of the kinase. Although inhibitors and protein activators bind to different sites on the kinase, the conformations they induce are mutually exclusive: binding of the activator destroys the inhibitor binding site and vice versa. Thus inhibitors and activators together in solution compete for kinase conformation.

In this proposal we will determine the structural mechanism by which competition between the protein activator TPX2 and the small molecule inhibitor MLN8054 is resolved in Aurora-A kinase. We will use F&amp;ouml;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and single molecule spectroscopy in vitro to monitor the conformation of the kinase and determine whether an equilibrium exists between the two singly bound conformations (model 1) or whether the binding mode of one binding partner changes to enable the kinase to bind them both simultaneously (model 2).

Our results will answer fundamental questions about biophysical control in protein kinases. They will be important in interpreting the results of inhibition-function experiments in cellular studies (for example, under model 1, binding of inhibitor will release protein activator into the cell with downstream result). Understanding the mechanism of conformational competition is particularly important in structure-based inhibitor design - against what conformation should the inhibitor be optimised, and should this class of inhibitors be developed at all?

Our choice of technique is highly innovative and will provide a first-in-class example which we expect to be applicable to many other systems.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Pharmaceutical industry
By determining the structural mechanism by which protein activators and inactive conformation inhibitors interact, this work is relevant to pharmaceutical professionals and academic scientists involved in the selection of constructs for high throughput screening of compounds and for lead optimisation (particularly crystallographic studies / structure-based drug design). It will enable them to determine whether they should use the apo enzyme, the enzyme-activator complex or both in the development of clinical candidates. The impact will be economic (more efficient use of funds in pharmaceutical industry by better targeted experiments) and societal (more effective inhibitors leading to better healthcare outcomes). 

This work will provide the first experimental assay to measure these effects directly. Having optimised the parameters in our laboratory I expect my laboratory to be more attractive for external R&amp;amp;D investment from industry to work on targets of direct interest to them (further UK economic impact).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156908</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50566A0C-12B8-4394-AA56-D4A39A4953B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic Equilibrium of the Aurora A Kinase Activation Loop Revealed by Single-Molecule Spectroscopy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/48b157f4f9f374c40d1cd7a3cb72c61b"><gtr:id>48b157f4f9f374c40d1cd7a3cb72c61b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gilburt JAH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fccb0e302a9.67371154</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DC5F3785-4B0B-4007-A342-0F31969D88AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Production of Protein Kinases in E. coli.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f065b28683a2b336c2acbe029d26c74c"><gtr:id>f065b28683a2b336c2acbe029d26c74c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dodson CA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1064-3745</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a57894f7b9aa5.66460604</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M021149/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>649031FD-C21E-42D9-AC12-41ACA59CC11C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemistry &amp; physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02FE9751-1497-4DFD-B349-D4A9C96538E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02567418-12CB-462E-9092-530C6E63B359</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9031EBB8-791D-4466-9E80-80F98BCB26E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Protein expression</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
