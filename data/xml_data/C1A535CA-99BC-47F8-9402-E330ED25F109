&lt;p>The research agenda focuses on how resource-constrained innovation can be better organised. The practice agenda will then translate and disseminate these findings to propel forward organisations keen to engage, but are unable to do so for lack of knowhow. By resource-constrained innovation,&amp;nbsp;Professor George&amp;nbsp;looks at those technology, service, and business model innovations that consume few resources, yet can be leveraged to create employment and wealth for organisations that champion them. In so doing, these innovations need to be targeted and enhancing social and economic wealth of impoverished and socially disenfranchised communities. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research programme includes a comparative study of UK, India, and Kenya drawing on a rich repertoire of case studies and large-scale quantitative data. In particular, it focuses on the energy and health sectors.&amp;nbsp;Professor George is&amp;nbsp;keen to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Develop causal theories of how resource-constrained innovations emerge within organisations, and why they succeed or fail. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Actively seek to engage individuals, businesses, and charities in promoting technologies, products and services with an 'inclusivity' agenda. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>To reach this community, the project uses&amp;nbsp;an ambitious programme of design workshops, managerially-focused dissemination events, and a book targeted internationally towards policy makers, individuals and managers. Taken together, the fellowship enables a 'research and practice' agenda that brings innovation for inclusive growth to the forefront of management studies.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>328793</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>HIV Treatment Improvement</gtr:description><gtr:id>DFA2FBD2-F737-4404-97DA-D3E2ABD0CC14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A report was submitted to UNAIDS on redesign of service delivery issues.

We discussed the implications for theories of entrepreneurship in extreme poverty, especially the role of social structure, affordable loss and effectuation.

Our results clearly show that occupational change intentions to entrepreneurship are driven by income seeking and risk tolerance whereas these attitudes do not predict other occupational changes from current occupation.

Preliminary results indicate provision of energy has created 20 new micro-enterprises, with the final survey scheduled to take place in November 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458debed2eac9.34578142</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My fellowship proposal outlined a 'research and practice' agenda, bringing innovation for inclusive growth to the forefront of management studies. I explored two thematic areas:
The Organisation of Innovation including business models, processes and open innovation: 12 published and 3 working papers, looking at innovation in developed world contexts and how processes could be improved to enhance firm performance and entrepreneurial outcomes. Inclusive Innovation or Innovation under extreme resource constraints: 9 published and 6 working papers tackling how innovation occurs in contexts with limited institutional structures and resources. With the funding provided by ESRC through this Fellowship as its basis, The Rajiv Gandhi Centre was able to establish a valuable research programme and continues to forge ahead with its world-class investigation into the nature of the innovation landscape for UK and Indian firms. With my fellowship at its heart as Director of the RGC I was able to attract leverage funding to study the role of energy in the socio-economic development of emerging economies, the integration of low-cost innovation into core markets and the effect of limited resources on organisational growth, ensuring clear impact on industry practice in the development of Indian and UK business, as well as tangible improvements to infrastructure in Africa. Now the RGC has an established reputation for high quality insight, the Centre's impact will continue to build on the ESRC-funded foundations and is in the hands of a new generation of researchers since I took up Deanship at Singapore Management University.
Inclusive Innovation - I co-developed a theoretical framework and research agenda for inclusive innovation by critically evaluating extant theories and methodological issues as well as empirical regularities. We identified areas of future theory and research development and elaborated a synthesised view of inclusive innovation. Published in JMS, 2012 (56 citations in 2 years).
Resource Constraints in Africa Our fieldwork research and report explored performance effects of resource assembly in Africa, finding that social capital, primarily kinship or family ties, helped entrepreneurs raise resources, but at a cost. Using small firm data in Uganda, we showed that shared identity among the entrepreneur's social network moderates this relationship, and, developed training programmes for Ugandan SME's. Research is ongoing and is now being extended to Kenya which will be reported on at a future date. A paper from this project has already been published in the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology.
Entrepreneurship within Communities - We explored social structure, affordable loss and entrepreneurship in Africa, using data from 1061 households in rural Kenya, find the disintegration of social structure negatively impacts the decision to engage in entrepreneurship. Preliminary results indicate that energy provision has created over 20 new micro-enterprises, with the final survey due in late 2014. This paper is under revision in the Strategic Management Journal. 
Business Models - I published my last book 'Models of Opportunity' in 2012, and by linking research on business models and organisational design to the reality of building entrepreneurial firms it offers actionable advice for practitioners. The book has sold over 3,000 copies, and continues to influence the content of Imperial's Executive Education programmes, used with companies such as: Vodafone, Unilever, BT, and the London Stock Exchange among others.
Health - A case study (published in Asia Pacific Journal of Management) examined GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute, an Indian public-private partnership (PPP), bringing emergency medical response to remote and urban settings. We showed how the organization established itself through institutional entrepreneurship and findings were disseminated to practitioners and scholars in China and India. In the Western context, we conducted a literature review of public-private partnerships, analysing over 1400 publications from multiple disciplines over a 20-year period, establishing that despite its significance, there is limited conceptualization and in-depth empirical investigation. We developed a multi-dimensional framework providing new directions for further research, testing PPPs across different countries and sectors. Further research will examine the performance of health PPPs, offering grounded empirical evidence on whether and how PPP arrangements may succeed in achieving benefits. 
Energy - We analysed 500 interviews of those in serviced and non-serviced slums in India to understand infrastructure provision and poverty alleviation. Our approach establishes the centrality of the water and sanitation components of infrastructure in bringing about positive socio-economic change, and how gender sensitive and integrated infrastructure provision can reap educational and health benefits, Published in Energy Policy, World Development (under review). 
Several working papers are in development, including work on India and China as sources of innovation, knowledge sharing in online communities within firms, and the delivery of healthcare services in India.
The ESRC fellowship has helped to cement my reputation as a leading scholar, which led to my appointment as the first non-US Editor in Chief of the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) in January 2014. Since assuming this role, I have implemented a number of improved processes that have resulted in noticeably higher article submissions than in previous years. As Editor I am able to determine trends and areas of focus for the management community as well as demonstrate my commitment to the championing of high quality research with real-world impact among fellow researchers.
Since leaving Imperial College London, I have secured a position as Visiting Professor (to be confirmed later this year), which enables me to continue the work begun with my ESRC-funded projects and develop my new links with the College to support the exploitation of the work we did there as well as the careers of my postdoctoral research assistants.
Finally, I will be collecting my Fellowship from the City &amp;amp; Guilds Institute in April 2015, further demonstrating how the ESRC funding has elevated my profile as a world-leading researcher.
