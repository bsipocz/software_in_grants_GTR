These are often decision problems (does there exist a structure satisfying certain properties?) or optimisation problems (what is the optimal structure?), but in this project we concentrate on a third class, namely counting problems. The phrase &amp;quot;counting problem&amp;quot; here is widely interpreted; examples of computational problems in this category include: (i) &amp;quot;find the number of satisfying assignments to a CNF Boolean formula&amp;quot;, (ii) &amp;quot;evaluate the partition function of the Ising model (an extensively studied model in statistical physics) with interactions specified by a weighted graph&amp;quot;, and (iii) &amp;quot;find the volume of a convex body&amp;quot;. Example (i) is a straightforward counting problem, (ii) asks for the evaluation of a weighted sum over spin configurations, and (iii) is a definite integral, which is the limiting case of a summation. 

Crudely put, there are two objectives in computational complexity, namely lower bounds and upper bounds. Establishing a lower bound amounts to proving that a certain amount of resource, say, time or space, is required to achieve a certain computational goal. Generally, lower bounds can only be established under some complexity-theoretic assumption, the most famous being P not equal to NP. In this project we concentrate on the more optimistic activity of establishing upper bounds, i.e., designing and analysing algorithms for a computational task that provably require only a certain amount of resource. Part of the rationale for the stress on upper bounds is that substantial progress has been made in recent years on lower bounds, and it is important now to see how far these can be matched from the other direction.
 
As the vast majority of counting problems are intractable, assuming exact solutions are sought, it will be necessary to investigate various escape routes: efficient approximation algorithms with guaranteed error bounds, algorithms that are provably efficient on restricted classes of problem instances, and parameterised algorithms whose bad behaviour can be controlled by a parameter that is assumed small in problem instances of practical interest. Another strand to the proposed research is to narrow the gap between what is efficient in theory and efficient in practice. In the classical theory, an algorithm is deemed to be efficient if it runs in time polynomial in the instance size. This theoretical notion of efficiency often corresponds to tractability in practice, but the correspondence is not so good in the context of counting problems, where Markov chain Monte Carlo is the most common solution technique.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The overarching aim of computational complexity is to understand and explain why some computational tasks are tractable and some intractable. A secondary aim is to explore how best to cope with intractability when it arises. Under the broad heading of computational complexity, the project proposes to examine the complexity of counting problems. Implicitly included in this study are sampling problems, since sampling and approximate counting have long been known to be of equivalent complexity. Since many real-life scenarios involve counting in some guise (e.g., evaluating a partition functions in statistical physics or evaluating a multidimensional integral) or sampling (e.g., sampling from a posterior distribution in Bayesian analysis, sampling from the set of contingency tables with given row and column sums, or sampling a typical configuration of a model in statistical physics), this foundational study is particularly well motivated by applications. 

Our (the PI's and PDRA's) main approach to communicating our discoveries will be through high-quality publications in the scientific literature and dissemination at internationally-leading conferences in the area. Since some of the themes of the proposal interact with other fields - for example constraint satisfaction (often regarded as part of Artificial Intelligence), statistics, and statistical physics - we also expect to interact with other communities at suitable venues, such as the forthcoming (Spring 2016) Simons Institute programme &amp;quot;Counting Complexity and Phase Transitions&amp;quot;, which specifically addresses the connection between computational complexity and statistical physics. The ultimate beneficiaries of this research (and indeed, of all research within computational complexity) are practitioners who design and use algorithms in their work. The process by which this impact occurs is a slow one and notoriously hard to predict. 

A secondary channel through which impact occurs is through the production of highly qualified researchers who make the transition to industry and commerce. Here I have only a small anecdotal item of evidence. A postdoc on the previous EPSRC grant left to join a high-tech startup company, which is well known for its products for fast data entry based on statistical analysis of text. I doubt anything he studied during his time as a PDRA was directly relevant to his job, but I suspect his acquired analytical approach and general algorithmic expertise were.

As with all fundamental algorithmic research there is always the potential for unpredictable benefits. Given the focus in this proposal on algorithmic (as opposed to intractability) results, the potential for unexpected benefits is somewhat higher. Given their unpredictability, any such benefits would be best dealt with by means of a separate funding application.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>361971</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0CB68DB7-F49C-4514-803B-B4A7A93488C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Switch Markov Chain for Perfect Matchings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the ACM</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2b4a923ef8dd82b90f9a5710a8e87cc2"><gtr:id>2b4a923ef8dd82b90f9a5710a8e87cc2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dyer M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1557735X 00045411</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7c93bb7c4390.65961172</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17003734-42AA-447C-983F-10A502D39260</gtr:id><gtr:title>Functional clones and expressibility of partition functions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical Computer Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/94cc8a5034743821bc5fd6f367c37474"><gtr:id>94cc8a5034743821bc5fd6f367c37474</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bulatov A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>03043975</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7c93bbe99358.06428346</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>12710640-749A-44B7-80CA-DAFF461195C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Complexity Trichotomy for Approximately Counting List
