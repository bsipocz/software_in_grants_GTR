When we talk about brain activity, the essence of this is the communication of information between individual brain cells, or 'neurons'. Although a great deal is known about this process, new experimental findings which add to our understanding of brain function are emerging all the time. This proposal will examine an important and only recently identified aspect of neuron-to-neuron communication which impacts on our knowledge of brain operation. To investigate this phenomenon, state-of-the-art methods will be employed which allow movements of molecules in living brain cells to be directly observed. Research like this adds greatly to our knowledge of how the brain works at the most fundamental level and could have important implications for understanding forms of brain disease or even inspiring the design of new and more sophisticated computer technology. Detail: Most neuron-to-neuron information transfer relies on release of a chemical 'transmitter' from a source neuron to a target neuron. Transmitter release is a complex process requiring lots of different types of specific molecules. These are concentrated at specialized sites in neurons known as presynaptic terminals, and the established view is that these terminals are therefore the only location within a brain cell where transmitter release can occur. Recently, however, researchers have found this idea to be inaccurate: in certain types of neuron, transmitter can be released at other 'non-specialized' sites within a source neuron. This is called 'extrasynaptic' release, meaning literally 'release away from the presynaptic terminal'. The mechanism allowing this process to occur, however, is not understood. The most likely explanation for how extrasynaptic release is achieved is that molecular machines needed for transmitter release can be readily moved from normal presynaptic terminals to new parts of the neuron. Confirmation of this idea, the manner in which it is controlled and what types of machinery are actually necessary, though, remains to be established. A knowledge of this would greatly expand our understanding of the necessary and sufficient components of chemical-neurotransmission, and will be investigated in this proposal. Experiments will rely on an important system for studying transmitter release: neurons grown on glass to form miniature brain circuits. With this system, presynaptic molecules can be visualized in living cells with microscopes and sensitive cameras. A second type of experimental approach will even allow neurons to be viewed at a resolution beyond the limits of a light microscope so that detailed information about the structure of extrasynaptic release sites can be obtained. Using these methods, experiments will focus on investigating how release sites are constructed, characterizing their properties, and comparing them to normal presynaptic terminals. The idea of extrasynaptic release is an emerging theme in neurobiology and has important potential roles in contributing to the communication between brain cells. This makes it a very worthwhile area of study. Moreover, incorrect control of transmitter release machinery is thought to be associated with some brain-related diseases; therefore, understanding this fundamental process may even offer clues about the treatment of forms of brain-disorders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The classical view of fast neurotransmitter release at central neurons is that exocytosis occurs exclusively at specialized ultrastructurally-defined active zones in presynaptic terminals. However, recent work has challenged this idea suggesting that at some central connections, vesicle fusion can also take place at extrasynaptic or ectopic release sites with important functional consequences for neuronal signalling. In hippocampal cultured neurons, an established system for studying neurotransmission, synaptic vesicles arising from stable synapses can readily aggregate at extrasynaptic sites and undergo Ca2+-triggered fusion with normal release kinetics. Moreover, preliminary experiments suggest that vesicles can even exocytose as they transit along the axon. How the highly-regulated and coordinated process of vesicle fusion can occur at such non-specialized sites remains unclear, however. To address this issue, fluorescence tagging and time-lapse imaging methods will be employed here to examine the composition of extrasynaptic release sites and the dynamics of their formation and operation. Experiments will also utilize immunocytochemistry, newly-developed optical glutamate sensors and Ca2+-imaging methods to explore the functional consequences of extrasynaptic transmitter release. Using acute hippocampal slices and ultrastructural investigation, the facility for extrasynaptic release in native tissue will also be examined. The capability of neurons to undergo extrasynaptic vesicle fusion undermines the conventional view of highly compartmentalized neurotransmission, suggesting that release machinery can be readily available across presynaptic structures. Understanding how this is achieved will shed new light on what constitutes the minimal complement of active zone machinery necessary for vesicle exocytosis, and further our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms underlying information transfer.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>416662</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Head of electron microsopy unit, MRC LMCB, UCL</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8CD36FD-A2D4-4DB4-81BB-A503AC924F0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PMID: 22442064

Findings disseminated in talks, invited seminars, research publications, open lab, public talks. Work has been included in undergraduate teaching.
2. Work offers new insight into fundamental mechanisms of transmission. It has provided the grounding for further successful grant awards from BBSRC (BB/K019015/1) and MRC (MR/K022105/1). In turn this will allow us to develop these findings towards the identification of regulatory substrates that might underlie for example, dysfunction of synaptic transmission seen in disease conditions such as Alzheimer's. Clearly this would have significant benefit for society.
3. Stimulated interest from a pharmaceutical company leading to a successful BBSRC-CASE award application. This work will focus on elucidating the molecular basis of vesicle recycling, exploiting our novel methodologies and the drug development expertise of the industrial partner (Janssen). Understanding this process at the molecular level will reveal critical substrates for synaptic modulation that might account for examples of disease-related dysfunction, and provide possible pharmaceutical regulators, that could be relevant to disease states. In the future this could have significant benefit for society.
4. Winning new grant funding that attracts high-quality international postdocs and forging links with European pharmaceutical companies serves to strengthen UK economic competitiveness and growth.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ECEE8E01-5BA4-4D08-ABA5-E195F58FEBD9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545a4672a7ca00.16961216</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The rapid transfer of information between neurons is a key element of brain function. Most neurons communicate through the release of chemical neurotransmitter at specialized contact points called synapses. The neurotransmitter is contained in synaptic vesicles - small spherical structures - which fuse with the membrane of the signalling neuron when active. Released neurotransmitter diffuses to synaptic structures on receiving ('postsynaptic') neurons, propagating information around neural networks. The established convention is that synapses are the only sites for vesicle fusion and transmission. Nonetheless, the contrary idea - that vesicle fusion could occur at sites outside synaptic terminals - would represent a novel form of information transmission which could signal unique and dynamic aspects of neuronal function. In this project we set out to test this idea.

Key findings include the following:

1. The 'superpool'. To examine the potential for non-synaptic vesicle fusion we used fluorescence imaging methods to track synaptic vesicles. Importantly, we found that vesicles were not stably located at individual presynaptic terminals but instead moved along adjoining tracks, or axons, between synaptic neighbours. We coined the term 'superpool' to describe the novel concept of a synapse-spanning vesicle population.

2. Extrasynaptic fusion. The presence of a superpool revealed how vesicles were continuously moved between presynaptic terminals. Next we used specialized fluorescent markers that change their signal as vesicles fuse, to show that mobile neurotransmitter-containing vesicles were also fusion-competent along axons in both cultures and native brain tissue. Key features of this novel finding were: a) mobile fusion required calcium and occurred at speeds comparable with fusion in synaptic terminals, b) important elements of synaptic machinery were recruited to or available at extrasynaptic sites to support fusion, c) mobile vesicles were 'retrieved' after fusion and re-used, d) mobile vesicle fusion occurred in cultured neurons and native tissue from brain slices. We also characterized the detailed organization of extrasynaptic sites using approaches to capture high-resolution images at the moment of fusion: vesicles were organized in small clusters near the membrane and opposite postsynaptic target structures containing receptors. Thus mobile vesicle fusion provides a dynamic and relevant mechanism to support novel forms of neuron-neuron signalling outside conventional terminals.

3. Regulation of the extrasynaptic pool. We showed that synapsin, a key synaptic protein was a critical regulator of the extrasynaptic vesicle pool size. Synapsin acts to tether vesicles at synapses but in cultures made from mice without synapsin, this tethering was disrupted and vesicle numbers outside terminals were substantially elevated. Another signalling molecule, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), was similarly important in promoting increases in the extrasynaptic pool size.

4. Extrasynaptic vesicles and plasticity. We demonstrated that synaptic terminals can undergo a novel form of adaptive change in function - or plasticity - which could underlie forms of learning and memory. This involved intrasynaptic changes in vesicle pools but did not depend on the trafficking of vesicles from the extrasynaptic superpool.

Our findings reveal a new non-conventional and dynamic feature of information transmission. Our findings are highly relevant to a complete understanding of neuron-neuron signalling, cellular/molecular mechanisms of learning and memory and as disease targets. Indeed, our pilot experiments are revealing that robust changes in vesicle traffic and extrasynaptic fusion occur in a disease model of Alzheimer's, offering possible substrates for new therapeutic development. We are now using our newly-developed approaches to examine relationships between synaptic pool architecture and function in native tissue.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings offer fundamental insight into elementary brain function. They will stimulate further research by other researchers aimed at exploring basic mechanisms of nervous system operation. In the longer-term they may aid our understanding of disease mechanisms. Evidence for this is starting to appear in the scientific literature where the 'superpool' and extrasynaptic release mechanisms are being mooted as possible disease substrates. In the future, understanding the cellular and molecular underpinnings of these processes could inform the development of targeted therapies aimed at alleviating or halting disease processes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B0D6E7B3-432E-4503-B007-88559CECC09C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5706709470.326742779e9794</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>METHODOLOGY: A novel imaging approach for dynamic studies of protein traffic based on the use of photoswitchable fluorophores.
