We will exploit three UK tax reforms between 1999 and 2006: the rate of corporation tax faced by small companies was reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, then to zero, before being raised again to 19 per cent. We will exploit confidential, newly available, data from the HMRC Datalab on the corporation tax assessments of the universe of UK companies.&lt;br />&lt;br />A substantial number of new companies were created around the period of the low rate of tax. We aim to identify the role of taxation in inducing these company births, as well as the also substantial number of company dissolutions. We will compare the new companies with existing companies. In particular, the incentive for unincorporated firms to incorporate differs across different levels of profit: we aim to identify the extent to which new companies simply took advantage of the low starting rate. We will also investigate whether the lower starting rate induced a higher rate of corporate investment.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83580</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The elasticity of corporate taxable income : new evidence from UK tax records</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>ECE61805-D64B-45A8-86DD-E3029D0B8EBA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at event titled 'Design and impact of tax reform'. We use the population of UK corporation tax returns between 2001 and 2008 to estimate the elasticity of corporate taxable income with respect to the statutory corporation tax rate. We do so by analysing bunching in the distribution of taxable income at two kinks in the marginal rate schedule. We find a relatively small elasticity of between 0.14 and 0.18 for companies with profits around the &amp;pound; 300k kink and a small marginal deadweight cost of 8% of the revenue that would have been generated by a marginal increase in tax, ignoring behavioural responses. We find a much higher elasticity of between 0.54 and 0.57 for companies around the &amp;pound;10k kink. By matching the corporate tax return data with accounting records and analysing joint bunching in the corporate and personal tax system, we decompose the overall elasticity of corporate taxable income into two parts: an elasticity of total income with respect to the net of tax rate of between 0.2 and 0.3, and an elasticity of the share of income taken as profit with respect to the difference between the personal and corporate tax rates of between 0.04 and 0.07.

We organised a Special Session in the 2013 Royal Economics Society Annual Meeting to highlight the importance of using administrative data for research in taxation and policy making, at which the paper was presented. We have also presented the paper at a number of other international academic conferences, including the Design and Impact of Tax Reform Conference in Vienna (October 5, 2012), the 7th Biennial Meeting of Hong Kong Economics Association (December 14, 2012) and the 16th UNC Tax Symposium (January 25, 2013).

We have prepared non-technical summaries of the studies addressing policy questions. We have circulated this material widely to a non-academic audience, including the Centre's mailing list of over 1000 people, including senior officials in HM Treasury and HMRC, in international organisations such as the IMF and OECD, and also tax experts in business and professional firms.

First, we investigate the elasticity of corporate taxable profit with respect to the tax rate. Under certain circumstances this elasticity can be a &amp;quot;sufficient statistic&amp;quot; for evaluating the costs to society generated by the tax. We use a technique proposed by Saez (2010) to estimate this elasticity, by analysing the extent to which companies &amp;quot;bunch&amp;quot; at kinks in the marginal tax rate schedule. Further, for companies where owner/managers are able to take income as salary or profit, we decompose the elasticity into an effect on the total income of the company and an effect on the share declared as profit. We derive the first estimates of the welfare cost of corporate taxation in the UK. 

We estimate that the elasticity of corporate taxable profit to be between 0.14 and 0.18 for companies with profits around the &amp;pound;300k kink in the marginal tax rate schedule, implying a marginal deadweight cost of 8% of revenue. We find a much higher elasticity of between 0.54 and 0.57 for companies around the &amp;pound;10k kink. Decomposing this into two parts, we estimate an elasticity of total income with respect to the net of tax rate of between 0.2 and 0.3, and an elasticity of the share of income taken as profit with respect to the difference between the personal and corporate tax rates of between 0.04 and 0.07. Together these imply a marginal deadweight cost of the tax around &amp;pound;10k of around 29% of revenue. We find no evidence of inter-temporal shifting of profit.

The second study concerns the incorporation decision of small businesses. Because we do not have access to data on unincorporated businesses, we use the merged data set to identify the total income each small company earns. We then identify (a) the minimum total tax that the owner could pay, conditional on the business being incorporated; (b) the actual tax that the owner paid; and (c) the tax that the owner would have paid had his business been unincorporated. This approach allows us to make inferences about the extent to which incorporation decisions reflect differences in the tax treatment between the different forms of business.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This main scientific impact to date has been through the paper: Devereux, M.P., L.
