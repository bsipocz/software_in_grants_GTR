Many questions arising naturally in this context are extremely hard to tackle and are likely to require new mathematical toolsets. The workshop will try to bring together experts from different areas of mathematics to identify these.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The last two centuries were undoubtedly shaped by the development of two major theories in physics. On one hand Newtonian classical mechanics and on the other Quantum Theory. Both theories, in their range of validity, remain unmatched in their power to describe nature. Yet, there are limits that classical mechanics imposes on us. Instability of the classical evolution equations in the initial data makes it impossible to predict the long term behaviour of chaotic systems. 

In quantum mechanics the situation is both better and worse at the same time. Heisenberg's uncertainty relation essentially forbids the preparation of states that are localised at a point in phase space. This on one hand means that we cannot know the classical initial value in the first place. On the other hand the smearing out of the initial data might prevent chaotic phenomena from arising. The clarification of whether the statements of chaos theory remain true in a quantum mechanical setting is of utmost importance for our understanding of nature. Remains of quantum time development at a microscopic level might still be visible at a macroscopic level. Understanding the mathematics of this will lead to new models and ways to calculate phenomena that were previously inaccessible. 

In the context of microchip manufacturing Moore's law (that the density of transistors on a typical integrated circuit doubles every two years) implies that we are rapidly approaching the time at which quantum effects cannot be neglected. In practice this means that a sophisticated understanding of quantum systems coupled to an external environment (so-called open quantum systems) is vital to maintain the present rate of progress.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17766</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The workshop has seen many discussions between experts and problem sessions were well attended.
