Solar powered irrigation will be provided by a combination of a condensing steam pump and a solar steam generator. The Imagination Factory has successfully completed Phase 1 of the SBRI Solar Powered Irrigation Pump and has demonstrated technical feasibility in a functional proof of concept rig Steam vacuum pumps are robust, piston-less and have very few moving parts. These pumps date from the earliest days of steam - steam vacuum pumps were widely used into the 20th century for pumping mines, ship bilges and for portable excavation work - they are well suited to pumping water with high levels of suspended solids. Steam applies direct pressure on the pumped water to provide positive displacement; condensing steam creates a vacuum to draw water into the pump. A vacuum is able to draw water to a height of ~30ft . Sub-Saharan Africa receives an abundance of solar energy. Solar thermal energy will be used to create low-pressure safe steam from a wet tube boiler. This project will combine these two well established technologies to make a modern solar steam vacuum pump; appropriate to localised low cost production, bringing practical affordable irrigation to these areas of the developing world. The Imagination Factory is working with Motivation - Freedom through Mobility ? a charity skilled in setting up training, local manufacturing and production plant in the developing world. During Phase 1 of the competition a broader network of potential collaborators has been established covering a range of expertise to assist in development, covering; Sub-Saharan testing (initially Tanzania), manufacture, financial inclusion, distribution and product support. The Imagination Factory has a number of creative approaches to meet the aggressive cost target for this pump. Recycled and repurposed fire extinguishers and other used pressure vessels are intended as the core pump components. The design intent will be cost sensitive from the outset, the pump will be available in kit form appropriate for simple production, assembly, servicing and maintenance in the developing world The Imagination Factory team includes members of the successful British Steam Car Challenge that broke and still holds the land speed record for a steam-powered car. Steam and engineering experience are embedded in this team.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971505</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
