In other words: what ever happened to Europe's national minorities? Making Minorities History (MMH) seeks to address this question by looking at the development of international schemes for the compulsory resettlement of national minorities in twentieth-century Europe. It shows how states attempted to rid the Continent of its 'ethnographic misfits' and problem populations not only through unilateral action but increasingly through multilateral channels, under the umbrella of international law and in the name of international peace and reconciliation.

The main focus of the project is on the concept of 'population transfer' - the idea that, in order to construct homogeneous nation-states (and thereby minimize tensions between them), national minorities could be relocated en masse in an orderly way with minimal economic and political disruption as long as there was sufficient planning, bureaucratic rigour and international support. Tracing the rise and fall of the concept from its emergence in the late 1890s through its 1940s zenith and its geopolitical and historiographical afterlife during the Cold War, MMH explores the historical context and intellectual milieu in which 'population transfer' developed from being initially regarded as a marginal idea propagated by a handful of political fantasists and extreme nationalists into an acceptable and 'progressive' instrument of state policy, as amenable to authoritarian regimes and fascist dictators as it was to bourgeois democracies and Nobel Peace Prize winners. As well as providing background on the key thinkers, politicians, international celebrities, political movements and regimes most closely associated with the idea, MMH also offers concrete examples (Greece, South Tyrol, Czechoslovakia, Poland) wherever a 'population transfer' was put into practice. 

MMH demonstrates that widespread international acceptance of 'population transfer' provides yet further evidence of a crisis of liberalism in mid-twentieth century Europe. Faced with seemingly irreconcilable disputes over national minorities and the dangers these posed for the peace and stability of the Continent, a threatened liberal order sought a morally and politically acceptable solution - short of precipitate expulsion or outright physical extermination - for dealing with these problem populations, and in doing so recast forcible resettlement as a humanitarian act. MMH shows, however, that the significance of the European embrace of the concept of 'population transfer' extends beyond the frontiers of ideology or nation and bears witness to the almost limitless faith that the mid-century mindset had in the capacity of the modern bureaucratic state, equipped with the advances of modern science and technology, to iron out the imperfections of Europe's 'untidy' historical development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

Making Minorities History has the potential to reach beyond a specialist academic audience. The themes (displacement/'ethnic cleansing'), period (the mid-twentieth century) and geographic focus (central and eastern Europe) of the project are all ones which continue to prove popular with a general readership/audience, as shown by the number of publications and documentaries which overlap with these areas. Publication of MMH with Oxford University Press, a world-class academic publisher will mean that the research will reach the widest possible potential audience for an academic monograph. Planned impact-related activity will also help target a potential 'cross-over' audience for this research among non-specialists with a general but informed interest in history (see the attachment 'Pathways to Impact' (PTI), Point 1). Since MMH also addresses questions at the centre of current debates about security and liberty in the modern democratic state - how far, for example, societies should go and what sacrifices they should make to defend themselves against perceived threats from within - it also has a public policy dimension (PTI, Point 4), as well as a potential non-academic audience among those, the media included, with an interest in understanding the 'long view' of contemporary developments (PTI, Point 3). Finally, given the international nature of the subject matter and the themes which MMH explores, the project will be of interest to audiences outside of the UK (PTI, Point 2).

How will they benefit from this research?

The British general public seems to have an insatiable appetite for the history of 'Europe of the Dictators'. While this sometimes obsessive focus on the Hitler-Stalin-Mussolini trinity has been much derided of late - especially in relation to the school curriculum and, by extension, university undergraduate module choice - the appeal of Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia to teenagers and adults alike is hardly surprising. As Richard J. Evans pointed out recently in the London Review of Books ('The Wonderfulness of Us', 17 March 2011, p. 9), in response to the ongoing debate about history provision in schools, study of European dictatorships 'raises critical questions of politics, morality and human behaviour in a dramatic form that has no parallel in British history', and engages what might otherwise be dulled imaginations. Professional historians, especially those of us whose work on twentieth-century European history is not primarily focused on the major dictatorships, should not dismiss this popular phenomenon but embrace it instead. Projects such as Making Minorities History can help broaden popular understanding of the mid-twentieth century by examining what Hannah Arendt called 'the degree of totalitarian infection', as reflected in the repressive measures which democratic states and liberal internationalists supported as a way out of Europe's mid-century crisis. There is evidence that the public is receptive to a more expansive view of the mid-twentieth century, as shown by the considerable interest in the US and UK since the 1970s in topics such as the forced repatriation of Cossacks, colonial counter-insurgency (Mau Mau) or wartime relocation of Japanese-Americans. How, then, is the public to be engaged in this instance? All of the proposed impact activity related to MMH is based on the premise that anchoring historical ideas to a contemporary context is often the best way of establishing initial interest in the topic and developing a meaningful explanatory framework for the audience. It is for these reasons that the impact activity related to MMH takes as its starting point a centenary (PTI, Point 1), a topical issue (PTI, Point 3) or an ongoing issue political controversy (PTI, Point 4) as a way of communicating the core ideas of the research project to a wider audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J003867/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
