However, no research to date has been able to disentangle between effects of improved access to abortion at the household- and cohort-levels; there is no evidence for developing countries; and existing studies of the impact of abortion legalisation on early life health in the United States are not unanimous.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Nepal initiated a drastic abortion reform in 2002. Moreover, because abortion facilities were made available to the public, the change in the law was not purely de jure. This research will collect data on local availability of abortion services, which opened at different times over a two-year period across the country. Combined with existing data sources, this information will allow estimating the effect of improved access to abortion more precisely, holding constant a number of potentially confounding factors. It will also compare neonatal mortality occurrence between siblings born before and those born after the opening of a nearby legal abortion centre, compare the effect on boys and girls, and estimate whether there is any evidence of improved access to abortion leading to sex-selective abortions.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15713</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Children of the revolution : fetal and child health amidst violent civil conflict</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDB7C275-1C94-4633-9513-5002A3575A76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Question and discussion during and after the talk.

In this context, the finding that legal abortion centres in Nepal do not affect parental investments in neonatal health despite contributing to reducing fertility is striking and contributes to gathering momentum for the rethinking of the way economists understand decisions related to fertility and investments in the health and education of children, adding to recent work by, e.g., Black, Devereux and Salvanes (Quarterly Journal of Economics , 2005) and Angrist, Lavy and Schlosser (Journal of Labor Economics, 2010).

The second key contribution pertains to the growing but still scant body of knowledge concerned with the rising phenomenon of sex-selective abortions. The finding that improved access to first-trimester abortion in Nepal did not contribute to skewing sex ratios is an important one in this context. Indeed, this finding has highlighted a new potential theoretical mechanism through which improved access to gender-blind abortion might in fact reduce sex-selective abortions for parents who do not have a marked preference for aborting a female or a male fetus.




First, the research indicates that legal abortion centres in Nepal did not affect parental investments in neonatal health despite contributing to reducing fertility, which goes against received wisdom in economics. As such, it contributes to gathering momentum for the rethinking of the way economists understand decisions related to fertility and investments in the health and education of children.



Second, I find that improved access to first-trimester abortion in Nepal did not contribute to skewing sex ratios. This finding has highlighted a new potential theoretical mechanism through which improved access to gender-blind abortion might in fact reduce sex-selective abortions for parents who do not have a marked preference for aborting a female or a male fetus.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Other researchers in Economics and related fields might build upon this work to understand further how households make decisions regarding investments in neonatal health and sex-selective abortions.

Except for 2 of the 141 facilities, one which could not be reached, and one that did not appear to have ever existed, all were surveyed.

A telephonic survey was carried out by the Center for Research on Environmental, Health and Population Activities (CREHPA) to obtain data on the precise location of each centre. The information was then used by the GIS Society of Nepal to map the facilities' GIS coordinates. The survey also collected qualitative data about the centre as a whole, such as determinants of the timing of opening, in order to inform choices made in the quantitative analysis phase.</gtr:description><gtr:id>36CCE348-4D00-4F1C-871A-4972F8B7D31F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have recently completed a further academic paper based on this database, which I will upload when the working paper version is out.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8037236796.72669366a87f9e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Anonymised data from census of legal abortion centres</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/id/eprint/850538</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>498132C0-94B2-4222-B025-F9955F82B776</gtr:id><gtr:title>Civil Conflict, Gender-Specific Fetal Loss, and Selection: A new test of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/24a2c5dbb0a7072e57b463d5f41b4475"><gtr:id>24a2c5dbb0a7072e57b463d5f41b4475</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Valente, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54637c739f9f89.65842068</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CA97A2B4-BC9A-4A0E-8069-3D8B0FCB56C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Population Policy: Abortion and Modern Contraception Are Substitutes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Demography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/529658a9cdd14ca4e07f174b9c438cce"><gtr:id>529658a9cdd14ca4e07f174b9c438cce</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Miller G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0070-3370</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58cbf6e2ed3031.92376855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>60BC8CB3-4F5C-4BD9-ABB9-DCD29A88975B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Access to abortion, investments in neonatal health, and sex-selection : evidence from Nepal</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/24a2c5dbb0a7072e57b463d5f41b4475"><gtr:id>24a2c5dbb0a7072e57b463d5f41b4475</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Valente, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_9153413363640c2e4e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E0DEE2BE-8A1F-4990-9E9E-8711578A3849</gtr:id><gtr:title>Access to abortion, investments in neonatal health, and sex-selection: Evidence from Nepal</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Development Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8688eba2b000dad3917e3a9e62baa2f6"><gtr:id>8688eba2b000dad3917e3a9e62baa2f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Valente C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b97942453f0.17980703</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A0B37CD2-3BBF-4C9E-920E-8165E1ACEC9F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Civil conflict, gender-specific fetal loss, and selection: a new test of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of health economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8688eba2b000dad3917e3a9e62baa2f6"><gtr:id>8688eba2b000dad3917e3a9e62baa2f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Valente C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0167-6296</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545b97da3fe8f2.29577134</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-000-22-3740-A</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3740-A</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
