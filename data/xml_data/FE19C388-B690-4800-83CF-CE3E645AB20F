grant</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/M001571/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Approximately 98% of the mass of nucleons, and therefore of the visible universe, emerges from the interactions among their constituents, the quarks and gluons. The Higgs mechanism, which gives mass to the bare quarks, is responsible for only a small fraction of the nucleon mass. The confinement of quarks within mesons and baryons is a direct consequence of their fundamental interactions. The field theory of the strong nuclear force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is now well established, and yet the phenomena described above cannot be understood from the QCD Lagrangian; they are emergent properties that arise from the unique complexity of these interactions. QCD is as yet intractable at the mass scale of nucleons and nuclei, so a clear picture of the fundamental nature of matter at these energies does not yet exist. However, this situation is set to change, and both theoretical and experimental developments in the coming decade are expected to revolutionise our understanding of nuclear matter within the context of QCD and the Standard Model. 

There are several key questions that will be addressed by the work proposed here: 

* What is the mechanism for confining quarks and gluons in strongly interacting particles (hadrons)? 

* What is the structure of the proton and neutron and how do hadrons get their mass and spin? 

* Can we understand the excitation spectra of hadrons from the quark-quark interaction? 

* Do exotic hadrons (multiquark states, hybrid mesons and glueballs) exist? 

* How do nuclear forces arise from QCD?

* Can nuclei be described in terms of our understanding of the underlying fundamental interactions?

The scientific vision behind the upgrade to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, Virginia, is to address fundamental issues such as how constituent quarks acquire mass, and why they are confined. It is therefore ideally suited to tackling the pivotal questions laid out above. New insights into the fundamental structure of the nucleon will be obtained from measurements of nucleon form factors, Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Transverse Momentum-dependent parton Distributions (TMDs). The fundamental nature of QCD confinement will be studied through the investigation of the light hadron spectrum, and the search for the existence of exotic states, in which the confining gluonic field provides an additional degree of freedom to the quarks. These states are a direct prediction of the QCD theory but remain unobserved experimentally. 

The Jefferson Lab 12 GeV Upgrade offers an exciting opportunity for the UK Nuclear Physics community to lead and instigate world-leading hadron physics research. The central scientific motivation for undertaking this project is a continuing desire to understand QCD physics: to obtain new information on the structure of nucleons, and to investigate the mechanism of quark confinement. This proposal represents a bid by the Edinburgh and Glasgow nuclear physics groups to build on established leadership roles, and enhance their impact on JLab's future science programme for the coming decades.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will develop a new piece of equipment to be used at the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory in the USA. The new device, the fast-timing hodoscope, will utilise the latest technologies in light sensors (Silicon Photomultipliers) and employ fast sampling electronics (Flash Analogue to Digital Convertors). The device will be a key piece of the future decades long experimental programme in CLAS12 at the upgraded Jefferson Lab. 

We have a very good track record in identifying and pursuing spin-off opportunities from our fundamental research. For example, the research and development programme for the Edinburgh nucleon polarimeter at MAMI has prompted new ideas for improving Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. This has led to the award of STFC Follow on Funding and direct collaboration with clinicians and medical physicists. We will use our developments in Silicon Photomultiplier readout and data acquisition to develop simple, safe and cheap cosmic ray detector kits for use in schools, an initiative which is being developed with the Edinburgh University Young Researchers Association. The silcon photomultiplier technology is also being transferred to the undergraduate experimental projects at Edinburgh. 

The nuclear physics research programme provides excellent training opportunities for PhD students. The size and scope of nuclear physics experiments means that PhD students must actively engage with all of the scientific and technical aspects of the experiments. Students and PDRA's obtain hands-on practical experience in the setup of the experiment, the use of modern software languages (C++) to analyse the data and also experience in advanced computer simulation methods (e.g. Geant4). Such students are in high demand from many areas of industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>536906</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Nuclear Physics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>National Institute for Nuclear Physics - Trento</gtr:department><gtr:description>HASPECT</gtr:description><gtr:id>6E54D165-9F65-4408-9535-9A44D27161C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Application to Horizon 2020 for financial support.

INFN (Genoa) played important role in the development and testing of the readout electronics (amplifier boards for SiPM light sensors). 
NSU and JMU succesfully won funding from the NSF to contribute to the hodoscope construction costs.
University of Glasgow will develop slow control infrastructure and contribute to the gain monitoring systems for the hodoscope. 

Edinburgh PI, PDRA's and students have been funded by overseas visitor funds from INFN.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We lead the development and construction of the fast timing hodoscope, a new particle ID system to operate close to the electron beamline at the Thomas Jefferson National Lab in the USA (JLAB). We carried out the detailed simulations necessary to establish the design and carried out the prototype testing to detail its performance. The UK contribution to the hodoscope construction funding is the only outstanding component, and is a central part of the JLab PPRP application currently under consideration.

We are spokespersons for the flagship experiment using the device (MesonEx) with the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. This will be the first experiment following the JLAB upgrade (2016) with 120 days of beamtime. The experiment has the potential to be a discovery experiment for the long sought hybrid mesons. We contributed significantly to the writing of the proposal and carried out many of the computer simulations which established the suitability of CLAS12 for meson spectroscopy.

The experience in silicon photomultipliers also enabled demonstrator medical imaging systems to be developed in Edinburgh. As well as advancing our medical physics research capabilities such systems have been used in training of MPhys students in medical imaging through project work. The students to date have a very good conversion rate in achieving competitive job appointments in hospitals and medical imaging companies using this experience.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8AA0E637-3F8E-421C-8433-C26C93EA8231</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d71049795065.22014593</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/M001571/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6FFDB010-9050-4605-B449-A6952906EB9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Nuclear Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AC14292F-9DCB-4DBE-BCB4-FA3B35E62EB6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hadron Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
