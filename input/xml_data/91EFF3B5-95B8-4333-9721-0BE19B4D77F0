Pellagra, Italian for ?rough skin?, was the disease of the four 'd's: dermatitis, diarrhoea, dementia and death. Through a book-length study, a new data set, a major international conference and a travelling historical exhibit, the ?Rough Skin? will explore the response of society, the state and the medical community to pellagra, and explore the experience of pellagra from the point of view of sufferers and their families.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project compares and contrasts the Italian experience of maize and pellagra with other regions similarly struck (like Asturias in Spain, the southern United States, and Romania); with other preventable deficiency diseases, such as beriberi and goitre; and with present-day man-made epidemic diseases, like obesity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, the project?s research assistant will prepare a data set based on the clinical files of pellagrins (pellagra victims) hospitalised at the asylums of San Servolo (men) and San Clemente (women), in Venice, providing answers about the construction of disease categories, the changing treatment strategies employed, and the social origins of pellagrins.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In terms of the project's non-academic reach, we propose a two-pronged strategy. First of all, the project will engage with the area of Italy that was most directly affected by the pellagra epidemic in the past: the Veneto region of north-eastern Italy. Given that much of the research will be done there, it is fitting that the project give something back in return. On this level, the project aims to contribute to increasing public awareness and understanding of economic and societal issues, that risk being forgotten. The PI has already made contact with the president of the San Servolo Foundation, funded by the Province of Venice and which runs the archives, library and museum, all located in the buildings of the former psychiatric hospital, to enable this collaboration (letter attached). The Foundation has generously agreed to host and provide expertise and technical assistance in the preparation of a museum exhibit, which will then travel around the Veneto. Two of the researchers formerly employed in the San Servolo archives were keen to act as consultants in the preparation of the exhibit and in assisting the project RA, who will act as a bridge between Leicester and Venice.

The exhibit will focus on the experience and treatment of pellagrous insanity in the Veneto region during the latter half of the nineteenth century, presented within the context of social deprivation, emigration and agricultural conditions during the period. It is important to recover this difficult past, in what is now one of the richest areas of Italy. It also important to represent pellagra within the context of mental illness, an aspect which has been too easily ignored, given the understandable sensitivity of the topic. The exhibit will contribute to San Servolo museum's collections, but it will also travel to visit schools and community centres in the Veneto region, in a series of one-day workshop events, during the third year of the project. These will be hosted locally and organised in co-operation with selected local consultants. The PI has already discussed the possibility of such an event in Treviso with a potential local organiser.

The input of local residents during the exhibition will also be an important means of further contextualising the project, representing user perspectives and ensuring a real exchange of knowledge. A poster and brochure will accompany the exhibition and document the main findings in an exciting and accessible way; local media will be involved; the preparation of other resources deemed appropriate for schools, such as an interactive CD, will also be explored, in association with teachers. Local collaboration and funding of distinct elements will be sought. There will also be a regularly updated exhibit website, in English and Italian, as part of the main project website, maintained by the RA, with the assistance of the PI.

On another level, the pellagra epidemic can teach us many lessons. Like the maize-based diet that led to the pellagra epidemic--polenta in northern Italy and corn meal in the southern United States--a human diet today that is energy dense and nutrient poor has lead to a pandemic of obesity, diabetes and associated chronic diseases. It is, therefore, the second strategy of the project to bring these to the attention of those who shape and study food and health policy internationally. There is a need to inject historical case studies into contemporary documents concerning hotly debated issues like creeping food monocultures and the problematic links between food, diet and health. The project will seek to engage with policy-makers at the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization, with the aim of contributing the importance of past experience into contemporary policy statements and documents. Online forums, such as the Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (part of the FAO), will enable input and participation in the policy-making and document-creating proce</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>430234</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As outlined in my original grant proposal to the ESRC, a museum exhibition was intended as part of the project to reach out to the wider community in which pellagra and pellagrous insanity affected so many lives in the past, particularly in the Veneto region of Italy where the project is based. This was to be mounted in the final summer of the project, 2016. To achieve this, the PI (Gentilcore) began planning for the exhibition in the summer of 2015. I started by contacting the Department of Museum Studies, University of Leicester, and my colleague Sheila Watson was quite helpful, suggesting that a History PhD candidate by the name of Yewande Okuleye, with curating experience in the history of science, might wish to become involved. 
My fruitful collaboration with Yewande began the first phase of exhibition planning, as I worked on the content of the 12 panels and Yewande commented on design and pitch. As I wished to conclude a projection of images as part of the exhibition, based on the numerous and emotive patient photographs from the late 19th century, we discussed the option of producing a short documentary film: this would constitute part of the exhibition but would also be a lasting legacy of it. Yewande proposed the names of several possible film-makers and I decided to approach and interview one of them, Martha Rose McAlpine. The three of us discussed the film project at a meeting in October 2015. We agreed on the nature of the short film to be produced and I duly commissioned Martha to make it.
This left the design and production of the exhibition itself. I had written the text and chosen the accompanying images for the 12 exhibition panels, but was unhappy with my graphic design skills, to say nothing of the logistics of mounting an exhibition in Venice. By happy chance, a professor of graphic design at Venice's prestigious Accademia delle Belle Arti (Academy of Fine Arts, part of the University of Venice), Mario Pasquotto, was teaching a course once a week on San Servolo. Mario had planned to make a module on insanity a part of his course, one of several student projects, given that he was teaching it on San Servolo, home of the former insane asylum. In March 2016 we discussed the possibility of using my proposed exhibition as the topic of the student project. And so began phase two of my exhibition preparation.
Mario's expertise in design and exhibiting were crucial. He asked his class of 55 students to divide up into 11 separate working groups. Each group was asked to 'produce' my exhibition: creating an exhibition poster and flyer, designing the exhibition panels (for the particular space on San Servolo where the exhibition would take place), as well as costings for all of the work needed to realise the exhibition. In April, each of the 11 groups presented their 'production' to a judging panel made up of Mario, myself (PI) and Egidio Priani (RA). Our role was to choose the winning group: the group that produced the most striking design, accompanied by accurate costings. One group was head and shoulders above the rest, and we selected them.
Phase three of the exhibition was final design, planning and realisation, done alongside the winning student group and Prof Mario Pasquotto. Egidio (RA), because he was based in Venice, had the key role of liaising between all of us, to ensure that deadlines were met. With Mario's help we were able to choose a reliable company to produce the panels, TicTac, which had worked with the Accademia on previous occasions. There were some last minute hitches, due in part to the logistical difficulties of getting the panels first to Venice and then to the island of San Servolo, and mounting them in situ; and in part to communications difficulties between my university in the UK and TicTac in Italy. But once these were resolved the official inauguration of the exhibition took place as planned, on 7 June 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>39598500-D5CB-4637-982D-F56B1B4FBD04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition is currently on display at the San Servolo Foundation, Island of San Servolo, Venice, where it will remain throughout June and July 2016, before travelling to the Museo del Risorgimento e della Resistenza, Ferrara, during the month of August.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57611db83b6c30.97017303</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Museum Exhibition: 'Rough Skin: Maize, Pellagra and Insanity in the Veneto, Italy, 1850-1900'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A fifteen-minute documentary film, produced by Martha Rose McAlpine, London, for the 'Rough Skin' exhibition to be held at the San Servolo Foundation, Venice, June-July 2016, and the Museo del Risorgimento e della Resistenza, Ferrara, August 2016.

How was a comparative iconography constructed and how this related to the parallel development of psychiatric nosology with regard to pellagrous insanity? Our paper illustrates the link between the use of photography and the history of pschychiatric knowledge and practice in the context of the Venetian insane asylums of San Servolo (men) and San Clemente (women). It covers the period from 1873, when the use of photography began in the two institutions, until the first decade of the twentieth century, coinciding the Crispi law for the reform of psychiatric hospitals and the lessening of the pellagra epidemic. 
Pellagra is a deficiency disease, which in northeastern Italy was caused by a subsistence on maize polenta and which decimated the rural population. In its latter stages it leads to insanity, with the result being that around a third of all asylum inmates of affected regions were victims of 'pellagrous mania', as it was labelled at the time. Situated halfway between organic and and psychic affliction, pellagrous insanity was then the source of much heated debate, not only theoretical and clinical, but socio-economic as well.
We reconstruct the scientific assumptions and intentions behind the introduction of photography in the two Venetian asylums and analyse the extent to which it affected clinical practice, the image of patients, representations of mental illness and wider beliefs associated with it, all in the context of a developing Venetian psychiatry. In particular, we focus on the use of photography in patient records. This allows us to explore pertinent and intersecting dimensions of clinical practice, such as concepts of objectivity, and the dialectic of latent/manifest and visible/invisible, in the framing of disease.

In nineteenth-century Italy, maize cultivation, with its prodigious yields and its ability to feed so many, had some very negative long-term implications. Maize altered longstanding landholding patterns, adversely affected peasant conditions and livelihoods (culminating in mass emigration), and radically transformed food habits (becoming a subsistence food and resulting in pellagra). Pellagra was soon identified as the disease of the four d's: dermatitis, diarrhoea, dementia and death. But the precise link between maize and pellagra, and an effective treatment for the terrible scourge, eluded medicine until the 1930s. 
Why should we be interested in the history of a deficiency disease like pellagra, which, today, appears only in connection with food emergencies? Like the maize-based diet that led to the pellagra epidemic-polenta in northern Italy and corn meal in the southern United States-a human diet today that is energy dense and nutrient poor has lead to a pandemic of obesity, diabetes and associated chronic diseases. Then, as now, a shortage of food is not the problem. Superimposing a map of obesity rates in the United States today on to a map of the pellagra epidemic there during the early the twentieth century, there is an almost exact fit. Poverty is a crucial factor in both. Today, it has been suggested, people on low incomes are likely to buy food that is bad for them; only the better-off can afford to make healthy and ethical choices.

This was my first chance to share and discuss my findings with a expert sociologists. Since sociologists are asking the most pertinent questions about man-made diseases (such as obesity) in particular, and about the food-health nexus in general, I was particularly keen to get their feedback on my thoughts about studying pellagra as a man-made disease and how the pellagra epidemic of the past can be usefully compared to the obesity epidemic of our own times.

We discussed the nature of the epidemic and about the category of man-made diseas, in particular the effects and implications of man-made diseases as related to poverty and diet. I made some useful contacts which I hope to develop further.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543782de2f61f1.93660196</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dietary Innovation and Disease in the 19th and 20th Centuries (international conference, San Servolo, Venice)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>282AFCCB-FD91-4865-8E01-896B5E1D3770</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dietary Innovation and Disease in the 19th and 20th Centuries

CENTRES AND PERIPHERIES IN THE CHANGING UNDERSTANDING OF PELLAGRA, 1850-1915

From the time of the first systematic studies of pellagra, in the 1760s, until 1937, when the link between pellagra and nicotinic acid was verified, there was no single agreed-upon aetiology of the disease, nor a single treatment, but a series of conflicting aetiologies and therapies. By the period covered by this session, the deficiency disease pellagra had been epidemic in Italy for over a century-disfiguring, debilitating, causing dementia and eventually death for thousands of sufferers-was reaching a peak in Romania, and was breaking out in the United States. Yet the understanding of pellagra, research into its causes, and the medical and public health responses in all three countries differed substantially. 
As a contribution to understanding the role of experts in the periphery, the three papers in this session explore the circulation and contested natured of medical expertise, between centres and peripheries, both within Europe and beyond. Priani's focuses on the treatment of pellagrous insanity in the Venetian asylum of San Servolo. If left untreated, pellagra leads to forms of insanity, often violent. In Italy, local psychiatric hospitals were the only concrete form of treatment offered to pellagra sufferers by the authorities. No systematic study has been done into these institutions with regard to the treatment regimes adopted and the (largely French) theoretical models lying behind them. 
Scrob and Gentilcore, in their different ways, both shift the emphasis to the contested nature of investigations into the nature of pellagra at a time when these were becoming more urgent, as the disease broke out in the United States. The time when the field of expertise was shifting away from Italy and towards the U.S. is ideal for understanding the circulation of contested knowledge and the role of national research cultures and public health policies in countries as diverse as Romania, Italy and the U.S.

As early as 1817 the well-travelled English physician Henry Holland summarised the main difficulty when it came to the control of the pellagra epidemic in northern Italy. 'The truth is', Holland wrote, 'that in a malady, thus extensively prevalent among the lower classes, and depending chiefly, as it would seem, on their diet and mode of life, no ordinary methods of cure can be adopted with a reasonable prospect of success, the evil requiring those more general preventive means, which it is out of the power of medicine to afford'. Provision had been made for supporting a certain number of sufferers in insane asylums, but this 'has done little in mitigating the evil'. Holland realised that it was 'not a light task to remove causes which affect a whole community of people'. Using a range of sources-medical treatises, government legislation and patients' clinical files-this paper will argue that this simple fact, that the only real solution was an improvement in peasant conditions, would limit the response by a risk-adverse state to palliative measures for the next one hundred years.

Our paper explores the issues of segregation and integration with regard to the admission procedures and treatment regimes applied to pellagra patients in Italian insane asylums during the second half of the nineteenth century. The focus is on the internal functioning of hospitals, as well as relations with the wider community. These are used as tools for comparing the reception and care of male and female pellagra sufferers with those of other mental illnesses. To do this we shall reconstruct the entire 'life cycle' of sufferers at two Venetian insane asylums: from local referral and admission, through to treatment, and ending with release back into the community (or death). In the process, we aim to give a voice to the actors involved: medical practitioners, patients, and local authorities.
The approach will be a mixture of the qualitative-using particular patient records from the two institutions-and the quantitative-making use of our 'Venetian Mental Asylums Database', or VMAD. VMAD is based on the patient files of the two insane asylums (manicomi) of San Servolo (men) and San Clemente (women), which served as the chief asylums for the Veneto region. It covers the period 1842-1912 for San Servolo and 1873-1912 for San Clemente, sampling one year in five, and is based on a total of 5,709 patient files, of which 1,587 relating to the pellagrous insane (830 men and 757 women).


Selected papers will be developed into chapters to be published in the selected proceedings, including our own.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>552e1d1b932420.69746094</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The focus of the project, at this developmental stage, has been to establish academic and wider social contacts in order to make the project widely known, both in the UK and in Italy.

First of all, we now know much more about the nature of pellagrous insanity, and its changing conceptualisations and treatments over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century. Discoveries relative to efficacy of treatment, the length of stay, readmissions and gender differences have been possible through the project's Venetian Mental Asylums Database (or VMAD, now deposited at the UK Data Service: http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8058-1). VMAD provides a key resource for exploring the suffering, conceptualisation and treatment of mental illness in nineteenth-century Italy, within a broad social, cultural, economic and medical context. It is the first Italian historical psychiatric data set to be published and it is hoped that it will allow comparison between the extensive work on 'insanity's archive' in the English-speaking world and Europe (particularly France and Germany) with the much less studied Italian experience. It is much to the ESRC's credit that it has enabled research to be carried out in Italy which goes unfunded there.

Secondly, we now know considerably more about the nature of nineteenth-century medical-scientific debates concerning pellagra and its aetiology, both in and outside Italy, a key objective of the 'Rough Skin' project. In addition to the one chapter published before the start of the project, the PI has published a second during the project: 'Louis Sambon and the clash of pellagra etiologies in Italy and the United States, 1904-15', Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, 71:1 (2015), pp. 19-42. And he has a third forthcoming: 'Disputing causation: conflicting scientific strategies, personalities and aetiologies in the late 19th-century Italian pellagra debates'. The PI hopes to turn these chapters into a monograph in due course, which will examine and compare the experience of the pellagra epidemic from the point of the view of the sufferers, on the one hand, and of doctors and medical investigators, on the other.

Thirdly, we are now better placed to pursue and develop an internationally comparative approach to the disease, its conceptualisation and treatment, both historically and in the present-day, in terms of other man-made, societal diseases, such as obesity. The most useful context is through the lens of wider developments in the fields of health and food production and consumption. This will be realised through an edited volume on the theme of Dietary Innovation and Disease in the 19th and 20th centuries, co-edited by the PI and Professor Matt Smith (University of Strathclyde), the outcome of the international conference of the same name held in Venice in June 2016, under the auspices of the project. Both editors will be contributing to the volume, which is currently under negotiation with Bloomsbury. 

New/improved research methods/skills developed: The PI has further refined and developed his pluralistic historical methodology during the course of the project. His approach entails dovetailing the different facets of the project, in order to reconstruct an overall vision of the subject in question. This means studying the past through an intersecting mixture of qualitative and quantitative methodologies; individual and group experience, actions and ideas; detailed, well-grounded and focused explorations with an eye to the bigger questions; asking historical questions inspired by anthropological and sociological insights, especially as they relate to concepts and strategies towards disease and its treatment. This was developed through the study of thousands of patient files, with an eye to both individual experience and the preparation of the project's Venetian Mental Asylums Database, referred to above. This methodology is particularly evident in the publication 'San Servolo lunatic! Segregation and integration in the life cycle of pellagra patients at Venice's provincial asylums (1842-1912)' (to appear in: J. Crawshaw, ed. Integration and segregation in the history of the hospital (London: Boydell and Brewer), which was co-authored by the PI (responsible for the text) and the RA (responsible for the data generation) in 2015.

New research networks/collaborations/partnerships: The project's international conference on 'Dietary Innovation and Disease in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries', co-organised by the project PI and Professor Matt Smith of the University of Strathclyde (https://dietaryinnovation.com/ ), led to ongoing collaboration with H-Nutrition, part of H-Net. Its aim is to foster communication within and across the otherwise unconnected fields in which history of nutrition is produced. Our chief contact there is Dr Emily Contois, who wrote a lively 'debrief' of the conference (https://emilycontois.com/2016/06/17/the-dietary-innovation-disease-conference-a-debrief/ )

Research capability generated from training: The RA in particular, Egidio Priani, has developed his own research skills and expertise, both in database creation and management and in historical analysis. After having co-authored two articles with the PI, one published and the second forthcoming, Priani has authored a research article on his own, as part of his career development. Entitled, ''Shrouded in a Dark Fog': The Diagnosis of Pellagra and General Paralysis of Insane between Venice and United Kingdom, 1840-1900', it has been accepted for publication in the journal 'History of Psychiatry' (in 2017).
Priani also organised a workshop dedicated to the theme of 'Pellagra and Pellagrous Insanity', held at the San Servolo Foundation, Venice, in July 2016. Taking this forward, Priani's interest in the intersection of physical and mental illness, and how these have been conceptualised in science and society over time, honed during course of the project, has led him to formulate a comparative research project on alcoholic insanity in Italy and Britain during the late nineteenth century. This is a further demonstration of the international reach of the broader project. Priani has applied for an EU Marie Curie individual fellowship, which if successful would be held at the Centre for Medical Humanities at the University of Leicester, in order to undertake this ambitious new work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The 'Rough Skin' project engaged with the area of Italy that was most directly affected by the pellagra epidemic in the past: the Veneto region. Given that much of the research was carried out there, we thought it fitting that the project give something back in return. On this level, the project will increase public awareness and understanding of economic, societal and healthcare issues, that risk being forgotten.

This objective was achieved by the preparation and mounting of a museum exhibition. In a series of panels and two video screens, Rough Skin: Maize, Pellagra and Insanity in the Veneto, Italy, 1850-1900, explores the impact of epidemic pellagra on the people of Italy during the late nineteenth century. Using period photographs and based on original research, this exhibition documents how psychiatric hospitals like Venice's San Servolo (for men) and San Clemente (for women) coped with what was then labelled 'pellagrous insanity' and how the disease impacted peasant families. Assisting Gentilcore in the design and planning of the exhibit is graduate student Yewande Okuleye, as well as a small group of students from the internationally-renowned Accademia delle Belle Arti, Venice (Fine Arts Academy), under the direction of graphic design professor Mario Pasquotto. The PI commissioned a short film, produced by the London-based film-maker Martha Rose McAlpine.

The exhibition, free of charge, was held first on the Island of San Servolo, Venice (June and July 2016), before moving on to the Museo del Risorgimento e della Resistenza in Ferrara (August 2016). At the request of the director of the San Servolo Foundation, it is now permanently housed at San Servolo, where it can be visited: an ongoing testimony to the work and contribution of the 'Rough Skin' project. Likewise, the exhibition film can now be viewed on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFGvoT6fRLA . Finally, the project website (http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/history/research/grants/rough-skin/home ) has been carefully designed to represent all facets of the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>389F097E-C3CD-4E3F-B782-41D65037C0CF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448f25a6cba32.77376095</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/history/research/grants/rough-skin/home</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>VMAD, the Venetian Mental Asylums Database' provides a key resource for exploring the suffering, conceptualisation and treatment of mental illness in nineteenth-century Italy, within a broad social, cultural, economic and medical context.

VMAD makes use of the records of the two chief asylums for the provinces of the Veneto: San Servolo (for men) and San Clemente (for women). It is based on the files which were kept for each patient and which record a wide range of information on standardised, printed forms: patient's name, place of birth and residence, age and sex, economic status, occupation, family members, nature of the illness and patient behaviour, length of stay, as well as all the stages of treatment and other interventions (dietary, pharmacological, surgical, etc.), and their impact, throughout the patient's stay, until the patient was either discharged or died in care. VMAD records one year in five, beginning with 1842 for the men (San Servolo) and in 1873 for the women (San Clemente, the year it opened), and ends in 1912. It records 5,701 admittances, corresponding to 4,261 different patients, of whom 2,492 men and 2,129 women. The preparation and publication of VMAD, by Egidio Priani and David Gentilcore, was undertaken as part of the Economic and Social Research Council research grant 'Rough Skin: Maize, Pellagra and Society in Italy, 1750-1930'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>79806579-B1CC-4D79-9E3A-E60615F95C81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the duration of the grant, the data set was intended for the exclusive use of the project team. We were able to utilise both in our research articles and in the museum exhibition we prepared. Our hope is that it will become a point of reference for future research into the functioning of insane asylums in Europe, as well as the classification and treatment of mental illness in the past. 
In July 2016, towards the end of the project, we submitted it to the UK Data Service.
