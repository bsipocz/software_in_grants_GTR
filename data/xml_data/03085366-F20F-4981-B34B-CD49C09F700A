advance gene investigations into WBS</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0800554</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Genetic approaches currently available in the mouse make this organism powerful for functional analysis of important genes and for defining molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of human disease. By ?engineering? mice to carry the same genetic defects as human patients we can study the resulting neurological and behavioural impairments in ways not possible in humans. But some subtle effects may be missed because current mouse tests may not assess the correct behavioural domains. Indeed human/mouse comparisons are often impossible because the tasks used are completely different. The pathological role of key genes are then missed and may be excluded from investigations into brain development. Individuals with Williams syndrome display problems in motor actions, anxiety, social behaviour, learning and memory, but the separate contributions from the different genes known to be involved are unknown. By developing tasks as similar as possible to those impaired in the patients and testing mice carrying mutations in specific Williams syndrome genes, we can investigate the separate contributions from each gene. The resulting comparisons will help us understand exactly what is going wrong in the patients, and may give clues to eventual remediation methods.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to develop a framework that will maximize the ability of targeted mouse models to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate normal and abnormal biological processes underlying human behaviour and cognition in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). Elucidation of gene function often involves cross-species comparisons of tasks requiring different cognitive demands, e.g. object-oriented space in humans compared to navigational space in animals. These two aspects of spatial cognition are known to dissociate in neuropsychological patients and therefore must call on different cognitive processes. We will analyze the key task demands of a battery of existing tests for humans and for mice, and then create for each species tasks based on paradigms that show deficits in WBS patients which render comparisons equivalent at the cognitive level. The discovery of associations between neurological development and candidate genes offers the prospect of characterising deficits in WBS patients and instituting educational and lifestyle measures to guide their developmental progression, as well as advancing functional investigations into the biological role of critical genes in WBS aetiology. The discovery of associations between neurological development and certain candidate genes offers the prospect of not only characterising deficits in WBS individuals and instituting educational and lifestyle measures to guide their developmental progression, but also advancing functional investigations into the role of the GTF family of transcription factors and CYLN2, all highly expressed in the brain and implicated in the WBS phenotype, in the aetiology of this neurological disorder. By initially studying monogenic deletions we can establish their neurological consequences in isolation before attempting investigations into combinatory effects. In summary, we aim not just to formulate a new battery of tests, but to form a fruitful interaction between molecular, behavioural and cognitive neurosciences in humans and mice to extend the ability of behavioural tests to advance investigations into gene function and human development. This work will provide a framework for behavioural investigations into other mouse models of human neurodevelopmental disorders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>734810</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Auditory-Brain Stem Response in Gtf gene mouse models</gtr:description><gtr:id>2F4FE40C-8502-4DB9-961F-D1C2E4DB3786</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ABR (Auditory-Brain Stem Response) testing is used to evaluate the function of the auditory nerve,cochlea and hearing pathways in brain.

All were interested in the research and asked many questions afterwards, stating that they understood the disease mechanism more clearly and were grateful for the interest in their child's condition.

Feedback from the lay audience was that the presentation made a complex subject very clear and made them understand a lot more about the genetics, Williams syndrome and its causes. They were also interested in getting involved in the research. I am regularly approached by families and the foundation in the UK and abroad for advice and information.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>nAjmaKuSTqz</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.williams-syndrome.org.uk/vebo/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2008,2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Charity Foundation laboratory visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92957FC4-CE26-4882-8552-38F93FBCBD0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Six Members of the Charity board visited the Department and I gave a tour of my laboratory and a demonstration of the genetics research carried out.

Dr May Tassabehji gave a genetics lecture to the families. The audience comprised over 100 participants (families, patients as well as clinicians). Those interested were invited to participate in the research. All families attending were keen to get involved and asked many questions afterwards. We were thanked for our research and for taking an interest in this rare disorder.

Families were able to understand the genetics of their children's condition and were able to participate in the research. All participants subsequently had a genetic test carried out and the reports sent to their clinicians for dissemination. Another family meeting is scheduled in September 2014 due to popular request.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>cxJ5aYG9g4h</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.wsasa.org.au/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Fine motor skills involve the small muscles of the body that enable functions such as writing and grasping small objects. There are no well established quantitative sensorimotor tasks for fine motor skills in rodents. We have devised a non-invasive rodent task which requires the use of orofacial and forelimb movements to succeed and can detect fine motor deficits. Early and progressive behavioral anomalies can be detected using this sensitive test, and can be applied to test the efficacy of various drug treatments in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. The use of this test in a home-cage environment is non-invasive but sensitive and has the additional advantage that it contributes to improvements to animal welfare.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F3C8E21-D5EA-4CA6-88D2-E1F42762376F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This non-invasive but sensitive method to assess fine motor skills in animal models has allowed us to detect sensorimotor function deficits in our mouse model (publication under review). The integration of this humane non-invasive test into behavioural batteries will allow researchers to detect early and progressive behavioral anomalies in genetic models of other neurodegenerative diseases and can be used to assess the efficiency of treatments to alleviate these phenotypes. In addition the use of such non-invasive tests will contribute to improving animal welfare during testing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>AfqjxWaAh36</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Development of a novel test for fine motor deficits in mouse models</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed an efficient behavioural phenotyping strategy which will aid the identification of subtle deficits in transgenic models which are directly relevant to the human disorders under investigation.

We have already provided a structure to guide the development of human testing in Williams Syndrome so that the findings can be correlated between humans and mice. 

The use of our fine motor screening task (which is non-invasive and advances the refinement component of animal welfare) has already been implemented by other researchers as an initial screen for subtle motor deficits prior to commencing their experiments to avoid the problem of inaccurate scoring of phenotypes that are not in fact associated with the domain under investigation, but are a consequence of undetected subtle fine motor deficits which can result in erroneous interpretation of data from transgenic studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>TxmssSPkW5P</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Behavioural battery for phenotyping mice</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed additional parameters for scoring behaviour in the resident intruder social test in mice.

Studying social behaviors in mouse models of specific human disorders allows testing of hypotheses of gene function and elucidating the molecular and physiological principles that underlie specific behavioral phenotypes and ultimately delineate the neural circuits that subserve social behavior. Our mouse model is showing social phenotypes seen in the human condition Williams syndrome. This is a new finding and this model will allow more in depth studies into the genetic networks and neurology of the phenotypes seen, which will help the understanding of the human condition and
