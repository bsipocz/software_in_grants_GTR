This period also saw a decline in the planters' political influence, cultural reputation and economic prospects, as slaveholders with properties in the Caribbean struggled to come to terms with the political problems posed by metropolitan criticisms of slavery and with the practical problems posed by the loss of mainland trading partners as a result of the American Revolution.\n\nThese broad themes will be explored via the extensive and rich letter collection of Simon Taylor, who was a wealthy and politically influential Jamaican sugar planter. Taylor's letters to friends, business partners, political allies and family members reveal details about all aspects of his life, ranging from information about his relationship with a free-coloured mistress to his political engagement with the anti-abolitionist West India Committee in London. This project will combine research on these letters with work on other sources, such as records of the Jamaican legislative Assembly, Taylor's last will and testament, contemporary newspapers and other published material. By using these sources to study Taylor and the world he inhabited, it will be possible to present a far more in-depth and subtle analysis of the planter class during the second half of the eighteenth century than we possess at present.\n\nKey questions include:\n\n- How did Taylor and other planters interact with other groups in local society? For example, how did he interact with poorer white managerial staff on his sugar estates, and what was the nature of his relationship with his free-coloured mistress and mixed-race children?\n\n- How and to what extent did Taylor and other planters change their attitudes towards enslaved people between 1760 and 1813? Did they adapt their management techniques or their attitudes towards their workers in response to abolitionist campaigning?\n\n- How and to what extent did Taylor's letters bind him into family, social, business and political networks that spanned the Atlantic? Did the Atlantic networks that Taylor forged connect him to places other than Jamaica and Britain? \n\n- How influential were Taylor and other Jamaican planters during debates over the British Atlantic slave system? To what extent were he and his colleagues able to stave off and influence the reform of Britain's slave system?\n\n- How did planters like Taylor perceive their connection with the imperial metropole? How did they attempt to reconcile their involvement with slavery with their identities as Britons? How did they respond to changing metropolitan ideas about Britishness? \n\nIn seeking to answer these questions, this work will build on my previous research, including my recently published monograph, Slaveholders in Jamaica (2009). I have also recently completed a short project on Simon Taylor's cultural identity, and as part of that, I worked on some of Taylor's letters. I therefore have a good sense of the value of these letters as a largely untapped source for the study of British Caribbean slave societies and transatlantic political debates. I have also acquired a full set of the letters on microfilm.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?\n\nThe main direct beneficiaries of this work will be academics and research students working on the histories of Britain, empire, the Atlantic, the Caribbean, slavery and abolition during the long eighteenth century.\n\nThe results of this research will also benefit taught undergraduate and postgraduate students taking courses on the histories of the long eighteenth century. Many such courses now include material on slavery and the Atlantic system and emphasise the cultural, social, and economic importance of the Caribbean region. \n\nThe research will also benefit wider public audiences. It will be possible to reach such audiences by engaging both with those working in the museum and heritage sector and with those working on outreach projects for organisations like the British Library and The National Archives.\n\n\nHow will they benefit?\n\nTeachers and students will benefit from the publication of a book that offers new perspectives on the history of slavery in the Caribbean and on the processes of reforming and abolishing Britain's Atlantic slave system. No modern study has yet replaced Lowell Ragatz's 1928 monograph on the fall of the planter class. This project will result in a study of that topic, providing a reinterpretation of the planters' decline that takes into account recent scholarship on the history of slavery, imperial politics, British identity and culture. This will provide a vital addition to students' reading lists. \n\nIn addition, the project will result in an entry on Simon Taylor to be published in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. This will provide researchers, students, and the wider public with information on one of the wealthiest, most prominent, and influential West Indian slaveholders of the late eighteenth century. It will help to emphasise the ways that slaveholding planters were able to influence debates about slavery and freedom, playing an important part in British debates about enslaved people and the future of the Caribbean. \n\nThrough networks and events like those offered by the UK Society for Caribbean Studies, this project aims to engage and alter wider public understandings of slavery and abolition. Interest in these topics has increased in recent years, particularly since the commemoration of the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade.\n\nI will share the results of the research with those involved in planning and constructing exhibitions and outreach projects on slavery and abolition at places like the National Maritime Museum, the International Slavery Museum, the National Archives, and the British Library, ensuring that new perspectives and insights from the research reach as wide an audience as is possible. Conference papers showcasing work in progress along with the final book itself will provide means of reaching this audience, as will more informal conversations and networking activities.\n\nIn addition, the project will result in a website that will be of use to teachers and to those involved in public history or working in the heritage industry. The website will provide an overview of the project and its contexts. It will also include transcriptions of at least fifty of Taylor's letters, specifically selected for the light they can throw on key topics such as slave resistance, the rise of abolitionism, and proslavery ideology and politics. These will be accompanied by notes for teachers. These notes will be aimed primarily at those working in higher education, as this complex material is of most relevance to existing courses and programmes of study at this level. The website can be accessed directly by students or by members of the public. It can also benefit those groups indirectly by informing the ideas and approaches of teachers or curators.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62112</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Jamaican Planters and the British Empire</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>591AE604-7E5A-4EDA-BA48-7ED7C160059E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented a paper, 'Jamaican Planters and the British Empire' to the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation (WISE), Hull, 22 May 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af83e89496d4.29680252</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mala tempora currunt (bad times are upon us): West Indian planters in adversity, 1783-1807</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E87E46E-8105-4A0F-94F6-7138D9F6C491</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research paper presented to the Society for Caribbean Studies conference, University of Oxford, 5 July 2012, followed by questions.

The site has received over 7,500 visitors between going live in August 2012 and November 2015, mainly from the UK (about 40%) and the US (about 30%). About 7% of visitors have accessed the site from the Caribbean. It is a resource aimed at other academics and their students in Higher Education but also at schoolteachers and the wider public.

The articles I have published using my findings from the project are freely accessible via green OA. There is a Twitter account associated with the Slavery and Revolution site (@SlandRev) with about 800 followers, mainly from the UK and US. 

I have presented conference and seminar papers to several audiences in the UK and internationally, and I am seeking a publisher for the book manuscript that resulted from the award.

In addition, I have been working with a vocalist, Elaine Mitchener (https://elainemitchener.wordpress.com/) on an artistic project that draws together a historian, a vocalist, along with a choreographer and other musicians to work on ways of exploring the past and its residues for public audiences, working specifically on the topic of slavery and abolition and using perspectives and insights derived from this project. This collaboration has received funding from the University of Southampton's Public Engagement with Research scheme and resulted in the development of pieces of performance art during 2016, which were showcased at Turner Sims Concert Hall (Southampton), Snape Maltings (Aldeburgh), and the Bloomsbury Festival (London) during 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD6966AA-EFF4-4EE0-9A44-33EB412B950F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5453a9ae5a64c3.08185236</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Work on this project has improved our understanding of the fall of the planter class in the British Caribbean and the transformation of the British empire during the period between 1763 and 1815. In particular it has shed new light on the life, career and outlook of Simon Taylor, a powerful and influential Jamaican sugar planter. This has also helped improve our understanding of this group more generally, with research on the project shedding new light on the lifestyle and material culture of planters as well as on their ideologies and outlook. The work has also helped further our understanding of the ways in which planters opposed abolitionist campaigns and arguments and of the ways in which abolitionist attempted to counter powerful slaveholder arguments about the economic value of the Caribbean sugar economy to Britain. This offers new perspectives on the ways in which the British government responded to such interest groups as they set about the task of reforming the empire in the years between the Seven Years War and the defeat of Napoleon. These findings are available via the following outputs:

A website, http://blog.soton.ac.uk/slaveryandrevolution/, which has attracted over 7,500 visitors between August 2012 and November 2015. The site showcases excerpts from the letters that formed the main source for this project, along with commentaries developed from my research. In addition, it contains open access versions of research outcomes, including two peer-reviewed research articles. This site has been used in teaching at the University of Southampton and been accessed by people from around the world-from the UK, US, Caribbean, Canada and Europe. 

There is also a Twitter account, Slavery and Revolution (@SlandRev), associated with this site, which has over 750 followers (February 2016).

An entry to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography on Simon Taylor (1739-1813), slave-owner and politician, (whose letters formed the main point of focus for the work): http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/104876

The fellowship resulted in a book manuscript. I completed a draft of this during the fellowship, which I have since been editing, extending and improving for publication.

In addition to the proposed outputs listed above, early work on the fellowship provided significant material for a peer-reviewed research article on the fall of the planter class: Christer Petley, 'Gluttony, Excess, and the Fall of the Planter Class in the British Caribbean'. In Christer Petley (ed), 'Rethinking the Fall of the Planter Class', special issue of Atlantic Studies 9/1 (January 2012): 85-106.

Work on the fellowship provided the research material presented in a peer-reviewed journal article on colonial society in Jamaica: Christer Petley, 'Plantations and Homes: The Material Culture of the Early Nineteenth-Century Jamaican Elite'. In Christer Petley and Steven Lenik (eds), 'Material Cultures of Slavery and Abolition', special issue of Slavery &amp;amp; Abolition (September 2014): 437 - 57.

Some findings stemming from the project will be published in a chapter, Christer Petley, 'The Royal Navy, the British Atlantic Empire and the Abolition of the Slave Trade', to appear in a forthcoming edited collection: John McAleer and Christer Petley (eds), The Royal Navy and the British Atlantic World, c.1750 - 1820. The book is in production with Palgrave.

The project has also resulted in several conference and seminar papers, presented in the UK and overseas during and since the lifetime of the award.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My published findings (and those disseminated via conference papers) can be taken forwards by other scholars working on Caribbean, Atlantic or imperial history.
