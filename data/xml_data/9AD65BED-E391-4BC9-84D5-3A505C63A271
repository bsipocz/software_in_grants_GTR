Perspective</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K006215/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The creation of 'a society for all ages' is one of the United Nation's key goals. Intergenerational solidarity is fundamental if we are to achieve the social change necessary to fulfil this ideal. Yet this solidarity is threatened by environmentally unsustainable models of consumption that raise fundamental questions about justice between generations in the Global North, rising powers, and the developing world. However, intergenerational justice has overwhelmingly been researched from a Western perspective. 

INTERSECTION will internationalise this debate though innovative, multi-method, cross-national research to explore inequitable consumption practices between different generations across time and space. The research will be located in three contrasting national contexts: China, Uganda, and the UK, where we will work in partnership with academic colleagues at Makerere University (Uganda) and Beijing University (China) and key stakeholders from international and national Non-Governmental Organisations (e.g. The Beth Johnson Foundation, Foundation for the Rights of Future Generations, World Council's Commission on Future Justice and Citizenship Foundation). These national contexts have been chosen because they are differentially positioned in terms of demographics (e.g. the composition and spacing of generations); cultural values (e.g. understandings of familial obligations, moralities and notions of personhood); histories; material cultures; patterns of consumption; environmental assets and problems. 

INTERSECTION is organised into three core elements (theoretical; methodological and analytical) and three strands of enquiry - Strand A, Who is Entitled to What? Generational Views on Entitlements to Consumption; Strand B, Who Wins and Loses? Perceptions of Intergenerational Equity in Consumption; Strand C, Who Owes What to Whom? Strategies to Produce a Society for All Ages. It brings together expertise from Geography (Valentine &amp;amp; Vanderbeck), Linguistics (Chen), East Asian Studies (Zhang) and English/ African Studies (Plastow). 
The research involves active collaboration with partners from the creative sector: the sculptor Anthony Bennett and the animated film-maker Nick Bax. They will create public art that will be: used as research tools; act as a focal points for the development of public engagement and knowledge exchange activities with our non-academic stakeholders; and will provide impact beyond the award by providing a lasting reminder of our obligations towards future generations

The findings will meet the challenge of developing new international and interdisciplinary understandings of intergenerational justice by developing an evidence base about how changing consumption values and practices relate to and/or impede the production of intergenerational solidarities. In doing so, it will produce new insights into how the relationship between consumption practices and intergenerational justice are understood outside of the global North. The research will also further develop cross-national research methods for understanding questions of intergenerational justice, promote transdisciplinary networks, and build research capacity through facilitating training and collaboration between researchers in different national contexts.

INTERSECTION will achieve impact by contributing to transnational questions about how to achieve cultural change in consumption practices and will inform government and international priorities in relation to building sustainable societies, and addressing intergenerational inequalities in national and international contexts. In doing so, it will contribute to the shaping of the future development of the AHRC's Care for the Future Programme, providing a leadership role by highlighting the significance of non-Western and international ways of thinking about intergenerational justice and sustainability and will contribute to the United Nations goal to produce a society for all ages.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT

* INTERNATIONAL NGOs i) The Beth Johnson Foundation (BJF) which promotes an understanding of the potential of intergenerational practice to address social issues; ii) the United Nations including UNICEF and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child; iii) International Consortium for Intergenerational Programmes which promotes intergenerational work from a global perspective; iv) Foundation for the Rights of Future Generations (FRFG) an advocacy think-tank; v) Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation that aims to connect individuals, families and communities by addressing transnational issues and acting as an 'exchange' for ideas
* NATIONAL GOVERNMENT/THINK TANKS: e.g. government ministries responsible for Education, Environment in each context; Equality and Human Rights Commission, UK; Children's Commissioner, UK; Development Research Centre of the State Council, China; China Development Research Foundation Institute of Public &amp;amp; Environmental Affairs; Economic Policy Research Centre, Uganda
* NATIONAL NGOS e.g. Think Intergenerational: Connecting Generations to Support Communities; Age UK; the China Youth Development Foundation and Ford Foundation, China; Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa, Young, Empowered and Healthy, Uganda.


HOW WILL IMPACT BE ACHIEVED

* DESIGN: NGOs have been involved in the design ensuring it addresses concerns beyond an academic agenda. The proposal has been informed by pilot work. The co-applicants have track-records of working in partnership with non-academic organisations, involving 'users' in academic projects, advisory groups and dissemination strategies, as well as undertaking applied research
* EXECUTION: (i) an international advisory group will be established including representatives from beneficiaries. This group will establish key performance indicators for the research, advise on impact, help develop knowledge exchange opportunities, acting as 'knowledge brokers' 
* KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE/PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT: 
(i) A high-level multi-stakeholder forum to debate the outcomes/recommendations of the research, with a particular focus on transnational implications and creating effective inter-professional dialogue. Feedback Forums: will also be held with research informants to reflexively inform the final report
(ii) The outcome of the above will be disseminated with the support of BJF through its Centre for Intergenerational Practice. It is the principal provider of intergenerational resources in the UK and delivers a wide range of products to support organisations develop and promote intergenerational work.
(iii) The research will develop intergenerational fairness indicators which will be fed into the World Council's Commission on Future Justice
(iv) Learning resources will be developed from our original data. We aim to work in partnership with the Citizenship Foundation - which runs projects in schools - because it wants to expand its reach and offering from local/national issues to global ones.
(v) A project exhibition - including an animated film by our creative partner Nick Bax will form the basis of public engagement events in Sheffield, Kampala and Bejing on Intergeneration Day Worldwide. 
(iv) Public artwork produced as part of the research by Anthony Bennett will be displayed permanently in public space to remind us of our future obligations (contributing to the mission of FRFG)
(v) International conference (2017) on the Creation of a Society for all Ages to bring together academics and beneficiaries. The proceedings will be disseminated through the media, and academic publications
 (v) We will invite a think-tank which holds high profile public seminars to organise a debate on intergenerational justice (eg Demos, The Work Foundation) 
(vi) Website with podcasts of our events; briefings; a blog, and 'ask the expert' section will provide research updates. Subscribers will receive quarterly e-newsletters.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>867356</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Sheffield sculpture Anthony Bennett has created a permanent artwork, 'Sustainability Dancer', reflecting the main findings and themes from the INTERSECTION project in consultation with research staff from each country.

Following this visit, the process was led by local facilitators Ping Chen, Ziyi Li and Kai Yu, supported by our China Research Associate Dr Chen Liu.

Both the Chinese facilitaors and participants said that participatory theatre methods are new to local people in Nanjing. We divided our participants into three age groups: a younger group (16-25), middle-age group (26-45) and older group (aged 48+). In the workshops, these three groups of people discussed environmental issues, intergenerational relationships and (un)sustainable consumption separately, and came up with creative ways to show their concerns to other generations, such as using shadow play and mimicking commercials. They came together for a final weekend workshop to form an intergenerational group of 43 people and to create new theatre work performed by people of all ages.

An audience of around 60 family members, friends and local stakeholders attended the final performance on 26 June. After the performance, there was a discussion about environmental problems in Nanjing, different generation's ways of life, and people's experiences of participating in this type of theatre project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588a0b4e4ff115.20112918</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/intersection/theatre/nanjing</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>We are Walukuba theatre workshops, performances and knowledge exchange</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3C6D2A3-DF0B-497B-A0A7-AA7289D20E9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 60 people from the Walukuba district of Jinja, Uganda, attended weekly intergenerational theatre workshops led by Professor Jane Plastow and Dr Katie McQuaid between February and August 2015. This culminated in a number of performances and knowledge exchange workshops as follows, and the independent establishment of We Are Walukuba as an intergenerational community arts organisation. 
(i) 13 June 2015 We Are Walukuba community theatre performance, with a cast of 60 and an audience of 500 community members.
(ii) 18 August 2015 We Are Walukuba Knowledge exchange performance and workshop on sustainable communities with a cast of 18, 19 community delegates and 80 representatives from Jinja Municipal Council, local third sector and industry.

(iv) 3 November 2016 We Are Walukuba performances on gender and land grabbing for the Jinja Muncipal Council Management Committee, with a cast of 11 and an audience of 35 including Deputy Mayor, Town Clerk, Deputy Town Clerk, Town Clerks of Walukuba/Masese, Central and Mpumudde divisions, Physical Planner, Local Chairman III for Walukuba/Masese Division, Senior Planner, Senior Education Officer, Economic Planner, Anti-Corruption Officer, Population Officer.

Some feedback from We Are Walukuba members:
- &amp;quot;It is a group formed to raise the voices of the voiceless. We raise to the ones in power, like that land issue. We do this as a group through drama. Last week we acted at the town hall in the presence of the Mayor. In Precious Women we tackled many issues affecting people down here. We speak in acting. And the other thing, we are intergenerational. This group was formed, usually you hear of those groups of youth, elderly, women, but this combines the young and old, and all genders, we don't discriminate.&amp;quot; (27 year-old woman)
- &amp;quot;We are sharing the knowledge, skills and acquiring confidence to address inadequacies that underpin development, addressing problems like gender violence, working conditions in factories and environmental degradation, and we are keeping the young and old together&amp;quot; (33 year-old man).
- &amp;quot;This group has really empowered us, the workshops help us to learn essential life skills like self-esteem and confidence. We do community outreaches and team-building. Theatre and poetry helped us to express ourselves and the key messages in an interesting way. Through fun people get to learn what is taking part in the community. It is an open organisation and a movement that keeps growing, growing and spreading.

The group's first 'Waste Action Intervention Day' was held at Works Village in Walukuba West, Jinja, in June 2016 and the same model has since been applied elsewhere. 

We Are Walukuba members conducted research at the household level and with Jinja Municipal Council to find out people's attitudes to waste disposal and management, and what services the Council offers. Whilst the Council is supposed to collect waste from commercial sites, this is sporadic and mired in corruption. Household waste is the responsibility of the community. People have little choice but to bury or burn their own waste, both organic and plastic, with detrimental effects on health, soil fertility and peri-urban agriculture so crucial for family subsistence. On the day itself, We Are Walukuba members instigated a community clear up, collecting scattered waste with the help of local residents and showing them how to separate organic and non-organic matter. Organic waste is collected to use in We Are Walukuba's Green Briquette Project. The community clear up is followed by a performance of their play, 'The Kingfisher's Story'.

'The Kingfisher's Story' was developed by INTERSECTION theatre lead Jane Plastow in collaboration with We Are Walukuba members. At the beginning of the play women come onto stage singing their anthem 'We Are Walukuba' and begin conducting a community clean-up. These women are challenged by passers-by who disparage their work, using real opinions collected during research such as members are &amp;quot;stupid to work for no money&amp;quot;, '&amp;quot;it is dirty work for less developed people&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;it is the council's responsibility to deal with rubbish&amp;quot;. There is then a singoff between the community group and those who do not care for their environment. When there is a risk of the two groups fighting, a storyteller breaks in and invites the actors and audience to listen to her.

'The Kingfisher's Story' is adapted from a Kenyan folk story. The story tells of animals meeting in the forest when it is very, very hot. Elephant,
Giraffe and Snake debate the causes until interrupted by the foolish King Lion, who threatens to eat everyone. At this point Eagle flies in and tells
everyone to run for their lives because there is a forest fire. The animals panic and head for the Nile to escape. They worry about the smaller animals who won't be able to cross, but the Lion says the strong must look after themselves and dives in - whereupon he gets eaten by a huge crocodile. While the animals are reeling with shock, a Kingfisher flies
across the Nile and swoops to pick up a beak full of water before heading towards the fire. Eagle asks what she is doing and she says she is going to put out the fire. When the other animals challenge her, saying she is only one tiny bird, she replies that she might be one but at least she is trying to do something to save their home.
The storyteller steps back, inviting the audience to share their ideas about what the animals should do next. Members of We Are Walukuba encourage the community to discuss their ideas about waste management and to generate grassroots solutions to environmental problems by working together as a community.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588a0a79ecef64.69477495</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/intersection/news/rubbishplay-1.565687</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nanjing Public Film Screening</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28C15BF8-B8E4-4159-8F35-E82DE5117EAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The INTERSECTION film 'Osbomb, Love and Supershop: Performing Sustainable Words' had its first screening in a packed community center in Jinja late last summer. The documentary, by Gravel and Sugar Productions, follows different generations coming together in community theatre workshops across three cities and continents, to share stories about sustainability. After its successful premiere in Uganda, we took the film back to Sheffield, UK and Nanjing, China in Autumn/Winter, to share with our participants and the wider public.

In December 2016, two film screening events were organised in Nanjing. The first was part of a seminar series at the School of Sociology in Nanjing University, primarily for students. The second event was a public screening at Nanjing Arts Institute, attended by the local film cast, facilitators, city residents and interviewees. At each event, the film screening was followed by an audience discussion.

The Nanjing audience liked the idea of gender-reversed 'Love &amp;amp; Money' play in Jinja and the appeal to gender equality, which they said is an important theme of social justice across the world. They perceived the older generation's scenes - in both Sheffield and Nanjing - as more energetic, creative and active then their younger counterparts. These performers challenge the age stereotype that older people are weak and vulnerable in public, which is a mainstream discourse at least in China. Audience members who had not taken part in the theatre workshops were curious about the process and why the INTERSECTION research team decided to use theatre as a way to do social research.

China Research Associate Chen Liu reflects: &amp;quot;The most impressive thing for me, is the theatre participants' passion for the project.&amp;quot; Since the performances and film screening, participants of all ages have expressed an interest in sharing the film with others, seeing more footage of their performances and connecting projects in Nanjing on the major themes of air pollution, overconsumption and gender equality.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588a10e7a461b4.15805007</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/intersection/news/filmpremieres-1.673673</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture at Mekele University, Ethiopia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F13B6003-13AC-4295-8D2F-54EC6876FCDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>w/c 21 February 2016 - Professor Jane Plastow was invited to give a lecture on 'Making Community Theatre in Uganda' for all students of Theatre Arts at Mekele University, Ethiopia.

The film features footage from intergenerational community theatre performances in China, Uganda and the UK.
The film screening in Sheffield, on 8 November 2016, was part of the city and nationwide Festival of Social Science. Around 85 people including many of the Sheffield stars of the film, friends and family, members of Sheffield City Council and the general public joined the film makers and INTERSECTION team for a screening and exhibition at the Showroom Workstation. This event took place almost exactly a year after an intergenerational cast of 30 first performed 11 short plays about sustainability in Sheffield, which raised a variety of environmental, economic and social concerns from fracking to austerity and immigration.

The film screening was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A and a lively discussion. The Sheffield audience commented that it was &amp;quot;excellent to see the realization of young and old that they can learn from each other&amp;quot; through creative projects. They also reflected on the value of theatre in social science research, as giving power to ordinary people to express the issues they care about. The different ways in which performers had interpreted sustainability across age groups and cultures was of particular interest. Some of the audience had expected a more environmental focus, but recognized that &amp;quot;working out what they [the performers] meant by sustainability was an important part of the process&amp;quot;.

Antony Mason from the Intergenerational Foundation spoke about the value of INTERSECTION in connecting ideas about intergenerational justice, fairness and sustainability across diverse national contexts. With so much intergenerational research focusing on Europe and the West, our film offers an alternative perspective grounded in ordinary people's lives in three very different cities. It also suggests possible connections. It was great to see themes from the Jinja and Nanjing scenes, such as tree cutting and negative age stereotypes, also strike a chord in Sheffield. The project and film was introduced by INTERSECTION team members Gill Valentine and Jane Plastow, who were joined by Kristina Diprose and Chen Liu afterward for a Q&amp;amp;A about how the project had worked across the three countries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588a10397e0e11.05995602</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/intersection/news/filmpremieres-1.673673</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sheffield intergenerational theatre workshops and performance</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6A4DE4F1-56EB-4E87-B381-C6A2A8A98A13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From September to November 2015, Professor Jane Plastow worked with collaboraror Matthew Elliot and UK RA Dr Kristina Diprose to deliver a series of theate workshops on the theme of sustainability.

This culminated in an intergenerational weekend workshop and performance, with a cast of 28 and an audience of around 50-100 including family and friends and an Advisory Board member from the Intergenerational Foundation. A feedback survey afterwards showed a positive impact on participants' interest in working with people of different ages, in global problems, environmental and social justice issues, and using theatre to share ideas, particularly among the younger generation. 

Feedback from participants
- &amp;quot;I've become more aware of certain issues. I'd heard of fracking but I now understand more about it, so I've learned something. I was really impressed by what the young people came up with, it shows that they do have a lot to give and I feel more positively about working with that age group in the future.&amp;quot; (Older generation)
- &amp;quot;I never thought I'd be performing with people older than myself. It was good working with my peers and to have acknowledgement for my ideas, it really boosted my self-confidence.&amp;quot; (Younger generation)
- &amp;quot;A highlight for me was doing scenes with the young people, from a rather unpromising start on Saturday to seeing the young people engaging with the issue, our older selves and the performance.&amp;quot; (Older generation)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b8b5b6809608.47099669</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/intersection/theatre/sheffield/about</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>99973</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement: 'Performing Living Knowledge: Developing a replicable model for arts-based empowerment of marginalised urban communities in Uganda and Malawi'</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0BF6FD96-34F0-400A-A2B5-48C493F16F30</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5890682947e295.84043400</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>13673</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC Responsive Mode Impact Grant, via Leeds Social Sciences Institute's Impact Acceleration Account: 'Keeping girls in school and safe from exploitation in Jinja Municipality, Uganda'</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B583C9A6-B9C2-4BAD-828D-939DAA05D8EC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>589068e40476b6.96448989</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Festival of Social Science public engagement funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1543B609-0507-4F2F-8988-D76C33E1EB5F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>588a1533e1b223.65973616</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Leeds Undergraduate Research Leadership Award (James Ward, Discourse Analysis)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Leeds</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>17769279-A817-42B4-99D3-E252331D16C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>588a14045c4690.77429323</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>We Are Walukuba</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>We are Walukuba' is an intergenerational community group of some 60 women and men of all ages from the Walukuba district of Jinja, Uganda.

We are Walukuba was registered as a Community Based Organisation (CBO) at the Jinja District Local Government Department of Community Based Services on 30th October 2015. They aim to use creative arts to promote sustainable development and environmental conservation in their local community and beyond. Their group meets to share ideas, identify key social and environmental concerns, and use creative expression to generate ground-up and sustainable interventions through local action designed to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing on research, inclusive discussion, and multi-stakeholder partnerships, they use a variety of art-forms including image theatre, poetry, music and dance, scripted and devised drama, to communicate and discuss key issues they identify at the local and national level to a variety of stakeholders. WAW operates on a principle of inclusivity with a revolving management structure to ensure those of both genders and all ages have the opportunity to work as equal
