One component of number proficiency is basic calculation, the addition of whole numbers with sums less than 20 and corresponding subtractions. When children start school they can solve some basic calculation problems. During the primary years, most learn to solve all basic calculations accurately and quickly. Children differ markedly in their skill and these differences seem important because research suggests:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>basic calculation proficiency is related to more general mathematical attainment&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deficits in basic calculation are common in children with number difficulties&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>there is continuity between number difficulties at primary school and adult number difficulties.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This project tracks a cohort of Year 3 Primary schoolchildren and their teachers over a year and collects data on psychological, social, and educational factors that previous research has identified as important. The data will be analysed to assess explanations of how basic calculation proficiency develops and why it is linked to more general mathematical attainment.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>412500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding why children differ in number development at primary school</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>A5FA2979-DE54-4260-8873-7A766E635E38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Children differ much in their number knowledge and skills when they start primary school and even more when they finish. Understanding the causes of this diversity is important both for achieving national goals for primary education and because difficulties at primary school predict difficulties in adulthood. Explanations of this diversity include factors within the home and factors within the child. There is no reason to suppose that a single factor is responsible. Preliminary data from our ESRC-funded project will be used to illustrate the importance of social, cognitive and specifically numerical variables.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2830098665.16115052b00deba</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding diversity in mathematics attainment</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>261E436F-DCBD-412C-A5DD-09578B551F2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to cohort one of the mathematics specialist teacher programme (MSTP) Easter school 2010, for the Institute of Education (IoE), King's and Roehampton consortium.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6432512930.0658712b00dffa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Individual differences in primary school children's number development</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>DE1A88D4-8F4F-4A14-BC48-FC115817F417</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Introduction to the background, aims and preliminary results from this project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9239326901.0254422b00dbf4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding the importance of facts</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>06DEE13E-1A10-4E78-AB74-2E2C3862CDAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation given at the Mathematics specialist teacher programme (MSTP) October school 2010, featuring results from this project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3672268962.1823552b00e108</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Primary school children differ hugely in their mathematics attainment. Although mathematics is more than computation, a surprisingly substantial correlate of attainment is simple computational skill, involving numbers less than 20. 



This project aimed to understand more about how simple computational skill develops and why it is related to mathematics attainment. We assessed the skills and number understandings of over 250 children in Year 3 and again in Year 4. We also collected information on other measures that previous studies had shown to be related to children's mathematical attainment. These included social factors, such as parental support, cognitive factors, such as memory and language, and other number skills, such as number sense. 



Understanding of number and computational skill were highly related. Nevertheless the results were more consistent with idea that skill develops from understanding. Understanding better predicted later skill than skill predicted later understanding.



Our data suggest simple computational skill is mainly related to more general maths attainment because both are affected by the same factors. There is very little diversity in maths attainment that can only be explained by simple computational skill. Also simple computational skill is not necessary for high mathematics attainment. Even children who were mathematically advanced for their age did not know many number facts. Many children who were doing well made occasional mistakes on simple sums. Imperfect skill in simple computation is not the barrier to success it is often assumed to be.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings and tasks used could inform the design and evaluation of interventions to support primary school children's mathematical development, particularly those for children making slower than expected progress.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D7948B6D-7209-4C96-B83C-E999F8B4FB2D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2015460796.6686232b2f049e0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>94EF9D36-DD5D-4B7C-B9B1-746526E54316</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Contributions of Domain-General and Numerical Factors to Third-Grade Arithmetic Skills and Mathematical Learning Disability.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of educational psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5dbcff37017d61442ebc5faf046a5d93"><gtr:id>5dbcff37017d61442ebc5faf046a5d93</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cowan R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-0663</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf96f96eedd663</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFB8F8A8-037C-4DB2-B8FF-6A6141DE2AC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Basic calculation proficiency and mathematics achievement in elementary school children.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Educational Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5dbcff37017d61442ebc5faf046a5d93"><gtr:id>5dbcff37017d61442ebc5faf046a5d93</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cowan R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf96f96a39525d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1889F27D-3DB9-4607-A25F-72A3321C655F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The development and importance of proficiency in basic calculation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Equals : realising potential in mathematics for all</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9db8527c3f94bd67e10ae27734bba1ea"><gtr:id>9db8527c3f94bd67e10ae27734bba1ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richard Cowan (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_1740448702cb29da16</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-0667</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/F001061/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
