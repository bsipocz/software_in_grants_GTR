Obesity</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G1002345</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>?Fat taxes? are often proposed to combat obesity. Indeed, economics suggests that an increase in the price of a specific food item leads to a decrease in its demand. However, the effect on total calorie consumption and so obesity is less clear; this will depend on the availability and caloric densities of any substitute foods. 

Similarly, an increase in household income will not necessarily increase consumption. The demand for certain foods may rise (e.g. luxury foods) whilst the demand for others may fall (potatoes are the classic example). 

In addition, the effect of price and income changes may be different for different household members: for example, some studies find income shocks to negatively affect nutritional outcomes for adults/elderly, but not for children, suggesting that adults give up food to ensure adequate nutrition for their children.

Due to a lack of data however, there has been relatively little research into individuals? responses to price and income changes. This study aims to redress this. Using a unique dataset, it aims to quantify how individuals respond to price and income changes, examining short (calorie consumption) and longer term outcomes (obesity) and estimating whether there are differential effects for adults, children and the elderly.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background
Over past decades, incomes have risen and innovations have changed the relative prices of expending and consuming calories such that food consumption has become cheaper. Despite this, there has been little research estimating the price elasticity of food consumption (caloric intake) and obesity. Similarly, there is little work examining the effects of income (changes) on consumption and obesity. 
 
The main reason for this is the absence of data. Food price data are scarce. If available, they generally cover very large geographical areas, are only observed for a limited number of food items/indices and show little variation across areas. In addition, almost all existing studies use data from one country: the USA. Estimates of income effects are hampered by a lack of individual-level consumption data that can be matched to information on household incomes. 

Aims 
I will examine the following research questions:

RQ1: What are the food price elasticities of consumption and body size? 
RQ2: How do permanent and transitory income shocks affect food consumption and body size?
RQ3: How do food prices and income shocks affect the intra-household allocation of resources, 
and does this vary by individual and family-level characteristics? 

Individual food consumption is defined by the percent of daily calories from fat and from protein and captures any short-term effects; body size captures the longer-term effect, and is proxied by individual BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and obesity status.

Methodology
As existing UK/US/European data generally do not include enough information to examine these questions in detail, I will use a very rich, unique dataset on a country that experienced large price variations, many income shocks, and has high obesity rates: Russia. 

The Russian data and setting provide a unique opportunity to examine consumers? price and income responses for several reasons. First, the data include very detailed community-level pric, linked to individual- and household-level data. Second, the economic reforms caused large price differences, both across and within communities. Third, Russians experienced large income shocks due to the reforms. If consumption and obesity is sensitive to prices and income, their large variation will allow me to detect this.

Scientific/Medical opportunities
This research examines whether changing prices and incomes (e.g. by using tax and subsidy tools) is likely to reduce obesity. It will result in (at least) three academic papers, which will be presented at national and international seminars and conferences, published as working papers and submitted to international high-quality peer-reviewed journals.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>283736</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute for Fiscal Studies</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>IFS</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F09A593-A8D5-4E59-9B87-7308967DB3F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work in progress
In my initial application to the MRC, I described three main projects I would be working on. One of these projects, looking at the effect of food prices on obesity, has just been done by someone else, using the exact data and methodology I intended to use. The project I am now doing with colleagues at IFS will therefore substitute for the project I had initially planned in my application. I will mainly be working on this research when visiting the IFS from January 2013. 

Nov 2013: We currently have a working draft of this project and are now presenting it at several external seminar series (see section on Engagement). We are still doing some additional analysis, but expect to submit the research to a high-quality international peer-reviewed journal in the next year. 

I have now also started working on a spin-off of this project, and I expect to mainly work on this in the next year. I have also started a different paper with colleagues at IFS, but we are still applying for additional data, so I expect this is more of a longer-term project.

Nov 2014: We submitted the first paper from this collaboration earlier this year, but have not yet heard back from the journal. I expect to hear something in the next few months. The second paper is now under way and we have some initial results, though it still requires more work; we are working on that now. I have also started discussions with other colleagues at IFS to collaborate on new projects in the future - these discussions are ongoing; we are currently looking at the feasibility of these projects. 

Feb 2016: We are currently revising our paper to resubmit in the next few months. We are also still working on the second paper. I have recently submitted a grant application to look at further issues relating to the economics of nutrition; these would be joint with colleagues at the IFS.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>ishVQEE3C85-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The data I use in my projects are available at the IFS and cannot be accessed from elsewhere. Contributions of my collaborators include access to data and facilities, intellectual input into the research as well as training. I am learning about different methods and approaches to modelling individual, household and firm behaviour, which is very useful for my future research projects and papers. My collaboration has introduced me to different (more technical) modelling approaches than I have used so far in my research. I have been working with different colleagues at IFS and started working on 2 projects together. In addition, I am discussing a set of new projects with different IFS colleagues to start in the future.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Nov 2012: As part of my MRC fellowship, I will visit the Institute for Fiscal Studies for 8 months from January - August 2013. I have already started as a visiting scholar there, visiting the IFS about once a month. I started working on a research project looking at the UK Healthy Start Scheme. I have been getting the data ready, doing the analysis, and writing it up. I have to be at the IFS to do the analysis, as the data are not accessible from elsewhere.

Nov 2013: I have recently started a spin-off of the initial project, also using the data available at IFS. This is still very much in its early stages, as I had to apply for data and information from the Department of Health (which I now have). I expect to be working on this mainly in the next year.

Nov 2014: I have visited IFS again for two months this year (May-June 2014), working on another nutrition-related project with colleagues there. This has turned into a longer-term collaboration, as I have recently been invited to become an IFS Research Associate. I am continuing to visit IFS regularly, and also plan to do so in the future.

Feb 2016: This collaboration is still continuing. We are currently finalising one project and working on another. I have submitted an application for additional funding, which would continue this collaboration in the next few years.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cornell University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute on Health Economics, Health Behaviors and Disparities</gtr:department><gtr:description>Cornell - Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8C2D4E3-85EF-4004-BF7E-E7B5C008F48C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cawley, J. and S. von Hinke Kessler Scholder. 2013.

My IFS visit was excellent. In short, I was able to present my work at their seminar series and received valuable feedback, I discussed my work with several colleagues, I attended many high-profile seminars, workshops and other events (e.g. 'Understanding changes in the British diet', 'Intra-household allocation', the Gorman lectures, a course on Policy Evaluation, etc), I started two projects with different colleagues at IFS and we are currently talking about the possibility of doing a third project, I attended their reading groups, I have expanded my network not only through my colleagues at IFS, but also through the visitors to IFS, many of whom I have met. I have recently been invited to be a IFS Research Associate, and am still visiting IFS regularly to work on our current and potential future projects. As I have learned a lot from my visit, I hope this is turning into a longer-term relationship, jointly doing a set of research projects.

I am currently writing a chapter on the history and use of the UK cohort studies, which will discuss the Born-in-Bradford cohort. I have been in touch with the relevant people in the cohort to let them know and get feedback on the chapter.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>fKRKk76kWs2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media: CMPO Bulletin (1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>81AD58AA-B4C4-4658-9D78-C0987BDA23E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CMPO Bulletin &amp;quot;Research in Public Policy&amp;quot; included an article on &amp;quot;Genetic Information: Potential Uses for Economic and Social Research&amp;quot;
