&lt;p>The Act gives statutory authority to ?Advance Decisions? (ADs) - enabling people to communicate their healthcare decisions in advance of losing the capacity to do so (eg due to coma or dementia). This is increasingly important when new medical technologies mean it is now possible keep people alive for years or for decades in permanent vegetative or minimally conscious states (ie with no - or virtually no - awareness of themselves or their environment). Many people say they would not want to be kept alive artificially if they were barely conscious, severely brain damaged, unable to recognise family and friends, and totally dependent on 24/7 nursing care, but only 3 per cent of people in the UK have legally effective ADs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This seminar series brings together experts in medicine, law, bioethics and the social sciences, and representatives from charities working with ADs to explore attitudes to and uptake of ADs five years after statutory implementation. It will address the extent to which they are effective in end-of-life decision-making and our work will inform future implementation strategies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic beneficiaries
The immediate beneficiaries will be the participants in the seminar series, most of whom are academics, who will have the opportunity to expand their own evidence-base and to network with other leading experts in the area. Four PhD students will benefit from the opportunity to contribute (a crucial capacity-building exercise). The wider academic community will have access to a publicly available website on which we will post powerpoint presentations and summaries of each seminar meeting, with additional information (reading lists, links to resources, expert commentary on completed ADs etc) as appropriate. They will also benefit from our talks and publications. The academic impacts thus involve: developing expertise and knowledge on ADs; training new researchers; fostering academic collaboration and exchange; and journal publications in both academic and professional journals, talks at national and international conferences, and an edited book.

Practitioners in medicine, law, palliative care and the third sector
The seminar series will reach practitioners via their inclusion in the design and participation of the seminar series itself. One of the co-applicants works as a GP one day a week in an inner-city GP practice (AS) and the other works as a solicitor (on human rights issues, specialising in the Mental Capacity Act) at Scott-Moncrieff &amp;amp; Associates LLP, London, and also trains lawyers and clinicians about the application of the MCA in practice settings (LC). We have deliberately selected participants with direct 'real world' involvements outside of academia. Two participants are employed full-time in the third sector, in charities directly working on end-of-life issues (PS, with Compassion in Dying; and a hospice/palliative care worker and trainer, tbc); one is a full time consultant in intensive care and anaesthesia. These participants will be in a unique position to take knowledge and ideas developed in the seminars directly into their own workplaces. Additionally, many participants have involvments in training (e.g. medical students, JK, CK, AS; nurses, JS), and serve on working parties and committees producing guidelines and recommendations for practice (e.g. Royal College of Physicians working party rewriting guidelines on the management of the vegetative state (JK); the Scientific Committee member of the European Association for Palliative Care (JS)) so practitioners will indirectly benefit from the knowledge and experience gained in the seminar series and contributed in these contexts. 

The general public
By developing our knowledge-base (across disciplines and nations), and by working collaboratively to solve problems in AD uptake, the overall aim of the seminar series is to develop knowledge about how to encourage uptake of ADs, how to ensure that they are written in such a way that they are applicable to the circumstances to which their authors intend, and how to ensure that clinicians develop confidence in interpreting and implementing ADs appropriately. To the extent that our seminar series and the projects that arise from it (i.e. future research projects and collaborations) contribute to achieving those aims, the general public will benefit in that (for those who wish it) their personal autonomy and right to make their own treatment choices will be better protected. The evidence from research in the USA is that this in turn will lead to a better end-of-life experience for the patient and for his/her family. (One benefit of this for the NHS is likely to be fewer complaints about end-of-life care - currently one of the key targets of formal NHS complaints.) End-of-life decision making in the twenty first century, with an aging population and with ever-increasing technologies for prolonging the lifespan in people with very severe impairments (e.g. permanent vegetative state, dementia), is of key and direct relevance for public health and wellbeing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14964</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Compassion in Dying</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Compassion in Dying</gtr:description><gtr:id>F78B4C97-BC34-4FC7-AC27-B33EB91CA73B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the public have completed ADs as a result of learning about them through this collaboration and as a result of the support and information we have collaboratively provided (for more detail see for example the Advance Decision Clinics reported in the 'Engagement' section of the form)

The AD templates designed by CiD have been significantly improved by feedback from members of the seminar series, thereby offering a better product for members of the public to record their end-of-life wishes (see full details in the section on 'Other Outputs')

Research on the CiD helpline which was the result of a collaboration between a member of the seminar series and CiD was cited in the House of Lords Select Committee on the Mental Capacity Act 2005 as part of a recommendation subsequently embraced by the Government (full details in the section on 'Influence on Policy')</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b82893ae398.66253669-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Staff from the national CiD headquarters in London have contributed to all three seminars (giving a talk at one of them) and to both AD Panels (giving a talk at both) and both AD Clinics (providing one-to-one appointments at both) held in Cardiff (2013) and York (2014) as part of the Before I Die Festivals. 

CiD has provided (free of charge) hundreds of copies of information leaflets, posters, and hard copies of their online AD templates (and the guidance for completing them) for distribution at our events (including all other AD Clinics, stalls associated with our other public engagement talks, and the feasibility study in a GPs practice).

Local (Yorkshire) group supporters of CiD have helped with staffing stalls associated with our public outreach talks.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Compassion in Dying is a national charity that supports people at the end of life to have what they consider to be a good death by providing information and support around their rights and choices. They are the leading provider of free Advance Decisions in the UK. 

The Research and Policy Manager for Compassion in Dying, Philip Satherley, was a member of our research seminar group and attended all the meetings. 

Our contribution was to provide the charity (via Philip's involvement in the research seminars) with up-to-date information and research about Advance Decisions and also (via our outreach and dissemination projects which included CiD representatives) to provide the charity with a platform for promoting ADs. 

We also launched a feasibility study (see 'Other Outputs') exploring the possibilities of promoting ADs via GP practices: this is something that CiD has been wanting to achieve so far without success. 

Additionally we provided expert feedback on various iterations of the CiD AD template - most recently providing feedback on the yet-to-be-launched online interactive version (with especial expertise on the section dealing with the vegetative and minimally conscious states - drawing on expertise developed as part of our other ESRC grant ES/K00560X/1). 

Another member of the seminar group, Professor Sue Wilkinson (Helplines Research Unit, Loughborough University) was conducting an evaluation of the CiD helpline during the period of this award, and benefited from her participation in the seminar series with helpful feedback from other participants on parts of her report presented as talks during the seminar (see Acknowledgements in full report).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advance Decision Panel at Before I Die Festival - Cardiff (16 May 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EA59EA81-D072-4CE9-B234-A8AC0D6E47EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Information about Advance Decisions was conveyed to an audience of around 100 including members of the public, around 30 lawyers, and the Welsh Government's Health Minister. 

Celia Kitzinger convened and chaired a Panel open to members of the public (and also accredited by the Solicitors' Regulation Authority for continuing professional development points) about a particular aspect of end of life care - Advance Decisions (ADs). These are legally binding documents that permit adults with mental capacity to refuse, in advance, any treatments - such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificial nutrition and hydration, antibiotics - that they would not want administered if they were to lose the ability to decide for themselves (e.g. if they were in a 'coma' or had advanced dementia). Eight of us - all members of the seminar series - spoke (for seven minutes each). We addressed the legal status of ADs, why people want to write them, the help available through the charity Compassion in Dying, and 'what if I change my mind'. We also had a speaker from the Hastings bioethics center describing the situation in the USA (where up to 30% of people have ADs, compared with 3-4% in the UK) and closing reflection on the implications for end of life care in the UK. More than 100 people signed up for this event and it was also attended by the Welsh government's new Minister for Health, Mark Drakeford, who formally closed the Festival by praising its achievements in promoting discussion about end-of-life issues and reiterating his support for improved end of life care in Wales. The event was very positively evaluated, including by solicitors present who have said they will use it to develop their own practice.

An independent evaluation of this event showed that it had been extremely successful, for example: 
 
? 82% of respondents said they had learned 'a lot' and the remaining 18% said 'a little'. No one who came to the event and filled out feedback said they had learnt 'nothing'. 55.1% said that the event had influenced their thinking and feelings 'a lot', and 44.9% 'a little. Again, nobody said that they had not been influenced at all. 

? 65.2% of people said that they would 'definitely' use the information in their work/studies compared with 28.3% who said 'possibly' and only 6.5% said 'no'. 

? 61.1%, said they would 'definitely' use the information from the event in their personal life 37.0% said 'possibly' and just 1.9% said 'no' they would not use the information in their personal lives. 

? Asked whether they would seek out more information: 68.6% said 'yes, definitely', 27.5% said 'yes, possibly', and only 3.9% said 'no'.

We ran an AD clinic at a city-centre location at which members of the public were offered free one-on-one consultations to help them write their own ADs - with subsequent follow-up by email or phone as necessary. Some of those who attended the AD Clinic subsequently contacted us to express their gratitude, saying that they now feel more 'confident' about creating 'effective' ADs such that their end-of-life wishes will be respected.

Feedback included:

'Very many thanks for having produced your notes so quickly following our meeting yesterday. Thanks also for the further explanations and the attached article about artificial nutrition. I will work my way through them and now feel much more confident about completing the AD form. I will let you know how I get on and also get back to you if there is anything I am still stuck with, but I hardly think this likely as your notes are so comprehensive. I really do appreciate your time and effort.' (email)

'[My wife] and I would like to express our sincere thanks and appreciation for your detailed and skillful analysis of our Advance Decisions at the meeting in York yesterday. The session was very useful and provided us with much food for thought. We will be modifying our ADs along the lines discussed at the consultation, making them more effective in the event that they should be needed.' (email)



Due to the amount of interest in Advance Decision Clinics - which we are now unable to fulfil - we have started the process of capacity building.

Two local supporters of the charity Compassion in Dying attended the AD Clinic as observers in order to begin to develop the knowledge and skills needed to do this work. We provided a short training session in advance of the clinic and also prepared for each of them an ;information pack containing the relevant sections of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, recent court judgements relevant to the way in which the Act is being implemented, a sample of (anonymised) ADs written by members of the public who've attended previous clinics (previously discussed in the seminar group) and some of my own and others' articles dealing with AD uptake and implementation). The plan is that both (and perhaps some other members of the group in future) will work with us over future sessions in order that they can develop the capacity to advise others about how to write effective and valid ADs. Through capacity building with community members in this way we hope to have a broader effect on enhancing the quality of life (and of death) in Yorkshire and in the nation as a whole, as well as increasing the effectiveness of public policy via improved understanding of it and changed behaviour to reflect that.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e7dace5ea87.39853496</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advance Decision Clinic at Before I Die Festival  - Cardiff (20 May 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B307C1B-28A1-44A7-A969-6188AEE353D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We assisted individual members of the public who were seeking information and help in making Advance Decisions about their medical treatment.

This served to increase knowledge and capacity in the area of treatment of vegetative and minimally conscious patients and support for their families, and enabled those present to act as ambassadors for the new online resource in their own advocacy organisations.

There was a particular interest in how Advance Decisions would help improve decision-making for PVS/MCS patients. At their request we subsequently worked with 7 advocates who were part of the audience to provide information and support for them in writing their own Advance Decisions (thereby drawing on expertise developed as part of ESRC grant [ES/J022306/1]). These advocates have since promoted ADs within their own organisations with both staff and clients. Most had known about ADs before the session but nobody present had actually done one. Their decision to complete and promote ADs was strongly influenced by this talk about families' experiences of PVS/MCS.

Speakers were: Verena Hewat (End of Life Rights Project Coordinator, Compassion in Dying), Robert Cole (Head of Clinical Practice, West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust); David Worth (retired Consultant Physician, York Hospital); Paul Murphy (National Clinical Lead for Organ Donation); Penney Lewis (Centre of Medical Law and Ethics, Kings College London), Celia Kitzinger (PI, ESRC Advance Decisions Seminar), Jenny Kitzinger (Co-Director, York-Cardiff Chronic Disorders or Consciousness Research Centre), Sue Wilkinson (Loughborough University researcher with Compassion in Dying Helpline). 

The discussion continued for 45 mins in the lecture theatre and for another hour over drinks afterwards. Several people signed up for the Advance Decision Clinic scheduled for the following day. 

Evaluation of all Before I Die Festival activities was carried out by a Festival administrator and showed significant knowledge gain amongst the audience at this event. On a 5 point scale where 5 = well informed and 1 = not informed at all: 
Before today, how informed were you about issues relating to the topic of this event? 2.54
After todays event how informed are you about issues relating to the topic of this event?; 4.52
Average knowledge gain of nearly 2 points (1.98) on a 5 point scale.

For many people the knowledge gained was personally empowering:
&amp;quot;I am now in a better position to write an AD&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I will make an advance decision and encourage my family members to do so also&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I will consider making an advance decision so my sisters know exactly what I want&amp;quot;

The use (in Jenny Kitzinger's talk) of healthtalk.org video-clips from our ESRC-funded project on Family Experiences of the Vegetative and Minimally Conscious States was particularly commended:

'I found the use of video clips incredibly powerful for conveying the real experiences of people facing these issues thereby giving great importance to the need to make advance decision (which has previously felt very hypothetical and not really relevant to me).'

'Especially enjoyed Jenny's presentation as her videos made the subject 'human' and real by showing us real people who have loved ones in a coma.'

The impact here demonstrates a productive synergy between activities associated with the two different ESRC awards in which the PIs of both are involved. The event was most proximally an outcome of the award on which Celia Kitzinger is PI (ES/J022306/1 and of which Jenny Kitzinger is fully participating member). The success of the event was clearly in part an outcome of the award which enabled the creation of the video-clips in which families describe their experience of PVS/MCS - an award on which Jenny Kitzinger is PI and Celia Kitzinger a Co-I (ES/K00560X/1).

Members of the public said that they would write ADs and many made appointments (via the AD Clinic) for one-on-one meetings with members of the panel for help and information about doing this.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e557547a601.98011598</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.beforeidiefestival.co.uk/listevents/page/4/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Death Dying Disposal Conference talk (5-8 Sept 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C0175F6-19F7-4F66-A5FF-B3E167D3FDDB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Questions and discussion followed.

People completed Advance Decisions or revised existing ones
The event created a lot of interest in ADs that extended beyond the relatively small number of people who actually attended the clinic; advertising the event raised the profile of Advance Decisions among the general public.
The AD clinic was over-subscribed and we had to run a second session.

'I very speedily wrote my Advance Decision after getting help from one of the panel at the Friends' Meeting House earlier this year. I am so glad I attended and have passed on info. to friends and family.' (AD clinic participant, email)

'I received helpful advice about fitting my thoughts into the format of the AD form from Compassion in Dying - in particular for more detailed statements in the section Values and Beliefs' (AD clinic participant, feedback form)

'The significance [of ADs] applies to all age groups in my family. I feel empowered to talk about these difficult thoughts and issues with my family and friends.'

Around 60 people attended (including some who turned up just for this talk, not having attended worship). The talk sparked many questions and stimulated a great deal of debate and led to the request for an AD Clinic for Quakers (such as I had run during the Before I Die Festival). This was duly arranged for 2 subsequent Sundays. About 40 people took AD leaflets.

An unknown but probably considerable number of Quakers decided to complete ADs and were given access to the resources for so doing. 12 signed up for the AD clinics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545bab2069bdd8.63914098</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Training for GPs (and other professional practitioners)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F7CCB0D-8155-481A-8B7C-D1AAAB80B4D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have run around 25 training workshops primarily for GPs but also for other professional practitioners (e.g. nurses, IMCAs, paramedics) and patient/carer groups.

The film was made as part of our work on ESRC award reference ES/K00560X/1.

At the same event, and in association with two local supporters of the charity, Compassion in Dying, we also mounted an exhibition and ran a stall for the public which included information about Advance Decisions and offered a sign-up sheet for members of the public who wanted one-on-one appointments at an AD Clinic to assist in writing their own. 

The impact here demonstrates a productive synergy between activities associated with two different awards in which the PIs of both are involved (Celia Kitzinger is PI on ES/J022306/1 and Co-I on ES/K00560X/1; Jenny Kitzinger is PI on ES/K00560X/1 and a fully-participating member of the seminar series funded by ES/J022306/1.)




After the talk there was a surge of interest in the stall about coma and ADs. We were fully occupied for about two hours with conversations with people about coma and ADs. About 50 people took AD templates and 6 made follow-up appointments for further information and help in filling them in. The talk about 'coma' had clearly challenged people's preconceptions and raised concern about end of life choices.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b9cd330be39.19660657</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://yornight.com/activities/health/coma-retelling-the-story/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>16000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>External Engagement Award 2013-14</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of York</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2A935AC3-FCB4-47DE-9929-455D34A030A1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f52f89fdf15.37257687</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1. Individual practitioners who participated in the seminar series reported that the seminar talks and discussions enabled them to reflect critically on their own practice and to make changes, e.g. amending nursing assessment documentation, making interventions at Regional Safeguarding Meetings, refreshing the medical curriculum to include ADs etc., (see 'Other Outputs')
2. We established an ongoing collaborative relationship with the charity, Compassion in Dying, the major provider of free ADs in England (see 'Collaborations') - and we worked with them (and with another organization, Friends at the End) to improve the quality of the AD templates offered by these organisations (see 'Other Outputs') 
3. We identified some of the problems with the current uptake and implementation of ADs. This led us to develop a series of public engagement activities designed to explore ways of improving uptake by contextualizing ADs in relation to discussions about death and dying making end-of-life decision more generally. These included two large-scale 'Before I Die' festivals (funded outwith this award) in National Dying Awareness Week (Cardiff 2013 http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/beforeidie/ and York 2014 http://www.beforeidiefestival.co.uk) attracting a total of about 1500 people (see 'Engagement Activities'). 
4. We presented our findings at Expert Panels on ADs at both Festivals. Additionally, we developed a novel concept - AD Clinics, which offer one-on-one help with completing ADs. The AD Clinics enabled us to learn a lot at first hand about the problems people experience in completing ADs and in the process to use our findings to date in helping these specific individuals to produce valid ADs that reflected their wishes and were likely to be applicable in the future circumstances in which they might find themselves. We have also given public talks and run AD Clinics as part of other public engagement events including European Researchers Night at York, the York Festival of Science and at campaigning (FATE/SOARS) and faith (Quakers) group meetings, and to practitioners (IMCAs) (see 'Engagement Activities'). Again we used our findings to help people who wanted to write ADs (and benefited from learning about their problems in the process). Over the last three years more than 300 people have been personally assisted by members of the ESRC seminar series group in writing ADs - a very concrete (albeit small scale) impact with positive feedback (see 'Engagement Activities') 
 5. Research first presented in these seminars contributed to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Mental Capacity Act via the submission presented by our partner charity, Compassion in Dying (see 'Influence on Policy&amp;quot;).
6. We were invited by the Minister of Health for Wales to write a report (commissioned by PPIW) about how to increase understanding and uptake of ADs in Wales.
 7. We exploited to the full the productive synergies between the AD research funded in this award and research also underway at the time on another ESRC award on 'Family Experiences of Vegetative and Minimally Conscious States' (ES/K00560X/1, PI - Jenny Kitzinger, Co-I - Celia Kitzinger). Many people say that they would want to refuse life-prolonging treatment that kept them alive as a 'vegetable' (i.e. in a long-term coma): this means that there has been significant synergy between the grants (e.g. see 'Contribution to healthtalk.org', the Radio Wales programme, 'York Festival of Science' and 'Yornight'). Note that we won the 2015 ESRC Celebrating Impact award for this other research project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>049E9B29-8ADD-4318-8E05-0B397775DE38</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545fca23035db2.67470615</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? We ran a series of three seminars (York, October 2012; Cardiff, May 2013; Warwick, December 2013) focusing intensively on sharing expertise about Advance Decisions (ADs) across disciplines, internationally, and between academics and practitioners in different fields, involving a total of nearly 40 people, including 5 PhD students.

 ? Two articles have already been published and two books are under way (see 'Publications') 
? We have identified some avenues for further research in relation to promoting ADs (a) via GP practices - we have done a mini-feasibility study of this (see &amp;quot;Other Outputs&amp;quot;) and (b) via Dementia clinics. 
Key findings are:
1. Reasons for lack of uptake of ADs relate to the broader social attitude to death and dying and an avoidance of the topic. It is particularly apparent from work in the US (represented at our seminars by Nancy Berlinger (Hastings Centre) that creating a context for talking about death promotes AD uptake.
2. Partly because it can be difficult for people to talk about death when they are confronting illness or disease, AD promotion should target the young and the healthy, not only the old and the sick. GP practices offer an opportunity for this (e.g. 'Flu Saturdays'). 
3. Early dementia diagnoses offer an opportunity for individuals who still have capacity to complete ADs in relation to a known illness trajectory and before they lose capacity, but this opportunity is often missed.
4. AD templates are often confusing and use complex legal and/or medical terminology that sometimes deter people from completing ADs.
5. We have learnt from our own experience in providing support and information for people writing ADs how time-consuming and demanding this can be, and something of the range of issues (both personal/emotional and practical) that people confront. 
6. Our findings have led to an invitation to write a report for the Public Policy Institute of Wales about how to increase understanding and uptake of advance decisions in Wales.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Charities such as Compassion in Dying and the National Council for Palliative care could usefully see the creation of a broader social context for the discussion of death and dying (e.g. Dying Awareness Week) as supporting the completion of ADs. 
2. It would be useful to explore the promotion of ADs in GP practices to relatively young and healthy people as part of routine primary health care. This is something we would like to take forward.
3. Further research needs to be done on why people with dementia diagnoses are not routinely completing ADs and how this can be promoted. We have made some links with people running 'memory cafes' which might enable us to explore this further.
4. We have already worked with organisations to improve AD templates and we are working on a publication about the problems people have in completing the forms that we hope will be of practical use to those who work with people trying to make ADs.
5. Providing support and information that people need to complete ADs is time-consuming and requires considerable medico-legal knowledge and interpersonal skills. If we are serious about improving AD uptake, more time needs to be allowed for these consultations and training is required - for nurses and GPs in general practice as well as specialist nurses for people with dementia diagnoses and other life-limiting conditions (MS, motor-neurone disease etc). 
6. We have written a report for the Welsh government on how to improve understanding and uptake of ADs in Wales, some parts of which are already being actioned.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FDDDDF4B-5FF8-4F4C-BF36-6C78F72F6382</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545e6bba46ce69.82129857</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ppiw.org.uk/ppiw-report-publication-increasing-understanding-and-uptake-of-advance-decisions-to-refuse-treatment-in-wales/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Report to Public Policy Institute Wales, commissioned by Health Minister, Wales</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>34A94A36-06DA-44AA-9C68-64CCD70FAA5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increase in understanding and awareness of ADs in Wales amongst stakeholders consulted in writing report (GPs, palliative care practitioners, paramedics etc).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e3b4b558deb2.68364611</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ppiw.org.uk/ppiw-report-publication-increasing-understanding-and-uptake-of-advance-decisions-to-refuse-treatment-in-wales/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Compassion in Dying written evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Mental Capacity Act (22 July 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2488E271-75BF-4A2A-9E49-3C2270985C0F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sue Wilkinson's research (for which she acknowledges the input of the ESRC Seminar Series) was cited in the charity Compassion in Dying's written evidence to the House of Lord's Select Committee on the Mental Capacity Act 2005. See CiD's written evidence on pp. 469-476, which includes extensive quotation from Sue's Wilkinson's work (cited in footnotes 26 on p. 472 and footnote 37 on p. 473).

Her findings (first presented and discussed in our ESRC Seminar group) were that healthcare and legal professionals' engagement with and understanding of Advance Decisions can be limited and that the public likewise has a limited understanding of Advance Decisions - both of which severely impede uptake. 

As a result of this research CiD called for increased promotion of ADs at a national policy level and this recommendation was accepted by the House of Lords who recommended that the Government should: 'urgently address the low level of awareness among the general public of advance decisions to refuse treatment and promote better understanding among health care staff of advance
decisions, in order to ensure that they are followed when valid and applicable; promote early engagement between health care staff and patients about advance decisions to ensure that such decisions can meet the test of being valid and applicable when the need arises; promote the inclusion of advance decisions in electronic medical records to meet the need for better recording, storage and communication of such decisions.' (Recommendation 26). 

The subsequent response from the Government (Valuing Every Voice, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-select-committee-report) supports this recommendation and requests the Mental Capacity Advisory Board to include ADs in its work</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e66f9926751.56894462</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/mental-capacity-act/mental-capacity-act-2005-vol1.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We asked people who have completed ADs (only 4% of the population) to submit them to us so as to build a data base of what real Advance Decisions (not templates, not the invented/recommended words on websites) actually say.

They vary along a spectrum from refusal of all life-prolonging medical intervention under any circumstances through to narrowly circumscribed refusals combined with a considerable number of requests for treatment. We are analysing these for what they show us about the problems of completing and implementing ADs. It is clear that some are invalid (one has no witness signature) or unlikely to be respected by professionals for other reasons (e.g. one is dated 1994). Others would pose real problems for practitioners who tried to implemented them because they are unclear or internally contradictory. We plan to publish a selection of these 'ADs by real people' along with (a) their author's reflections on what they were trying to achieve when they wrote them (and why); and (b) commentaries on them by intensivists, neuro-rehabilitation specialists, care home managers, lawyers, para-medics and others who are on the sharp end of trying to implement ADs (see Kitzinger and Lewis, forthcoming).</gtr:description><gtr:id>AAFDA3CA-55BE-4270-8890-A030DE5A64E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nothing like this data base has ever existed before and we have been unable to find any previous published analysis of 'real people's' ADs.

But without a systematic analysis of the documents themselves we cannot actually tell what the problems are, or figure out how to solve them. (One small impact that has already resulted is that many of those who submitted their ADs to our data base have subsequently revised them to ensure that they better reflect their wishes.)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546377b7a21ff1.13373330</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Advance Decisions by Real People</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>754F2988-C854-4EC8-B028-4A67FF0575C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>A matter of life and death</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Psychologist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/970ed8eaf93e4ca0589df95a0a6a6360"><gtr:id>970ed8eaf93e4ca0589df95a0a6a6360</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kitzinger, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e3a5701ff223.66527653</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>564CD337-5D11-4535-B928-C395D4D27333</gtr:id><gtr:title>Advance Decisions: Do they work in practice?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Elder Law Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc6ceba80c27a0ceac7d33e9f488d378"><gtr:id>bc6ceba80c27a0ceac7d33e9f488d378</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kitzinger C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b46ba563232.18604125</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB189869-16F6-4A6E-B6AD-35B59DCA77AE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Advance Decisions - Examples, Reflections and Commentary</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc6ceba80c27a0ceac7d33e9f488d378"><gtr:id>bc6ceba80c27a0ceac7d33e9f488d378</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kitzinger C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>545b8d27d99f63.02395118</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>814CCBE9-D152-4773-A80C-E50767F0650A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Advance Decisions: Theory and Practice</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc6ceba80c27a0ceac7d33e9f488d378"><gtr:id>bc6ceba80c27a0ceac7d33e9f488d378</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kitzinger C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>545b8d9d75eae9.68192498</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J022306/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
