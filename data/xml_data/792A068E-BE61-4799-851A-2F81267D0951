Precision medicine is underpinned by understanding the diverse response of human beings to diseases and treatments, and there is no doubt that ancestry plays a major role. 

Smoking is one of the leading risk factors of the top five causes of death world-wide, including heart and respiratory diseases, killing around 6 million people a year. The number of smokers varies among world regions, and of the 1 billion smokers worldwide, 80% live in LMICs. Reassuringly predictions modelled by WHO show a reduction in smoking prevalence in most areas over the next ten years; however, Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean show an opposite trend. In the UK, ~17% of the adult population smokes regularly; in England, this figure varies considerably between ethnicities, with Black Caribbean and Asian groups showing a rising prevalence. 

The strongest associations between genetic variation and smoking behaviour have been consistently shown at locus 15q25.1, containing the cluster of CHRNA5-A3-B4 genes which encode subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In the brain, nicotine binds to nAChRs stimulating the release of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin and glutamate, impacting the reward pathway, learning and memory. To date, 14 genetic loci have been identified, including genes for nAChRs (on 8p11 as well as 15q25), nicotine-metabolizing enzymes and proteins involved in neurotransmission (DBH, BDNF). Notably, 5/14 loci were discovered in the first genetic study in UK Biobank (UKBB), led by the team that will host the proposed Fellowship. However, as in most genome-wide association studies (GWASs), the focus has been mostly on individuals of European origin. 

To overcome this limitation I will disentangle the genetics of smoking behaviour in European, Asian and African individuals and will investigate admixed individuals to boost genetic discovery. To this end, I will undertake a discovery and a replication GWAS on ancestry-specific groups as well as performing a trans-ethnic meta-analysis across all ancestries. I will then combine methods from population genetics and genetic epidemiology to develop a strategy for including admixed individuals in association testing and boost power for association studies.
Thanks to the diversity in the UK all the ancestries are represented in the half million individuals included in UK Biobank which will be used for discovery analyses; replication analyses will be carried out including ancestry-specific cohorts made available through collaborations. 
The outcomes of this project will highlight the biological background of smoking dependence and help towards a better identification of treatment and stratification of patients by nicotine-dependence and ancestry. The wider impact of this project will include developing pipelines for the analysis of big health and genomics data which will be transferable to other traits; it will contribute to the body of knowledge on ethnic health, which will help shaping future studies; and it will provide me with the perfect vehicle to complete my training in health data science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project will provide novel insights into the aetiology of smoking behaviour in diverse populations, which will help to underpin advances in precision prevention of tobacco-related disease, and contribute to define best practice for the analysis of health data in populations with a different demographic history, and genetic structure, from Europeans. 

Traits to be analysed include smoking initiation, cessation, quantity (cigarettes per day) and dependence (combining smoking quantity and time to the first cigarette). The variables to be used in association testing will be derived and harmonised from the answers to the questionnaires used in each cohort.

Individuals of European, Asian and African ancestry will be included in ancestry-specific and trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies. Methods from population genetics will be combined with association testing for the analysis of individuals of admixed ancestry. Discovery analyses will be carried out using the data made available by UK Biobank, a large longitudinal study which includes samples from 500,000 volunteers aged 40-69 years, where the three ancestries of interest are all represented. Replication analyses will be carried out in ancestry-specific cohorts. Linear mixed model association testing will be used under an additive genetic model for all phenotypes, including sex and age as covariates. On the associated variants, in silico functional follow-up analyses interrogating public databases will include eQTL analyses and variant annotation with the aim of identifying regions and genes of interest. On the genes identified, pathway and druggability analyses will be performed to understand the impact of the findings.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>292991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S003762/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
