It is a system of interconnected, membrane-bounded compartments within the cell, forming a metabolic continuum called the secretory pathway. A major component is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is the port of entry of the secretory pathway. The ER is a network of tubular membranes involved in the synthesis, assembly, quality control and export of proteins to other compartments of the secretory pathway. The ER is also a major site for the synthesis of lipids and is present in all eukaryotes, but has unique features in plant cells: it can act as a storage compartment for proteins (like in maize seeds) and lipids (like in oilseed crops such as sunflower). The ER is a very dynamic structure and can change its shape in order to accommodate these diverse functions. However, we do not know why the unique architecture of the ER is necessary for its function. Nothing is known about the factors that regulate plant ER shape and how its shape determines how much protein and lipid the ER can synthesise and/or store. 
Over the past 5 years we have made some important discoveries on the mechanisms that may help regulate the organisation of this important structure. We have discovered that a family of proteins called reticulons can induce changes in the shape of the plant ER network, thereby affecting its function. Also we have identified some proteins which are good candidates as regulators of ER network branching, tubule fusions and anchoring. To help our studies, we have contributed to developing a computerised mapping system for analysing the dynamics of the ER. 
In essence, we now know the ingredients required to build the architecture of the ER. What we don't yet know is how these ingredients come together to determine it.
In this transnational project, we propose to investigate the nature and interactions of the proteins that anchor the ER network to other organelles, and the proteins that permit new ER tubules to form, to grow and fuse with existing tubules. We will study how changing the expression of these proteins affects the synthesis and transport of lipid storage proteins, especially in cereal seeds. Understanding the function of these key regulators will allow us to redesign the ER in order to improve its capacity to make proteins and lipids in seed crops.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the cellular organelle that regulates the flux of proteins and lipids into the secretory pathway, and is responsible for storing large amount of proteins for human and animal nutrition. The ER has a unique and dynamic architecture, which changes to allow for different biosynthetic functions. Building on our collaborative work over the last 5 years, our team combines expertise in plant molecular and cell biology, biochemistry, microscopy and cereal genetics to bring understanding of ER structure/function relationships to the next level. 
We aim at understanding the key molecular determinants of ER shape by studying their function, regulation and interactions. We also propose to investigate interorganellar cooperation by analysing putative contact points between ER and plasma membrane and ER and protein storage vacuoles. We will manipulate the key ER morphogens and assess how changes in ER shape affect protein and lipid biosynthesis and storage. This work will be perfomed in model plants and, importantly, in seeds of cereals (barley, wheat and maize) in order to test directly the ER structure/function relationships in these crop models.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research combines both basic and translational elements. The importance of the plant secretory pathway in economic terms cannot be understated. A great proportion of the food consumed on the planet in terms of proteins and carbohydrates is manufactured and processed in the organelles of the secretory pathway. Likewise the pathway is responsible for the production of much of the plant extracellular matrix (wall) material which is important in numerous industries (wood, paper etc) and more recently in biofuel production (both in terms of oils and carbohydrates for fermentation). Therefore, any research underpinning our knowledge of the function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has great potential benefit to the development of strategies to manipulate or increase protein productivity in plants. Also the ER is the site of synthesis of many of the economically important molecules that are in development, through plant expression, by the biotechnology sector. Antibodies, peptide antigens and protein based therapeutics being good examples.
Short-to medium term beneficiaries will be applied plant biologists, in particular cereal biologists/breeders. In the long term beneficiaries of this work will include the agricultural sector, through enhanced food production, the biotechnology and health sector through the production of economically valuable molecules and the biofuels sector through oil production in the ER. It is worth noting that Frigerio, Hawes and St&amp;ouml;ger have already collaborated in successful projects, such as the EU funded PharmaPlanta programme, on the production of antibodies within the plant ER.
All partner institutions have active technology transfer offices. Therefore, in the event of any exploitable intellectual property emerging from the projects we are well placed for exploitation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>362970</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Part of the award is to study proteins that shape an internal membrane structure in the plant cell - the endoplasmic reticulum. This structure is responisble for the biosynthsis and processing of proteins detined for starage of to leave the cell. The membrane shaping porteins are called reticulons and there are 21 of them in the arabidopsis genome. We have discovered that 2 of these, nos 19 and 20 have an extended terminus which has lipid biosynthetic capabilities, but the two proteins do not seemed to be involved in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum. Lipid anaysis of mutant plants has shown that indeed these proteins have some effect on the lipid ontent of plant cells. This discovery is being pursued further.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is to early to predict</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>864434B6-8336-4D9B-8BFE-CFE7C3047D71</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cdaf1d9a01d9.02690822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C65C597-AD14-4219-AE91-52FA18A86AA4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Serial block face scanning electron microscopy and the reconstruction of plant cell membrane systems.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of microscopy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f63e67a51dae49eb9655c41b54e15835"><gtr:id>f63e67a51dae49eb9655c41b54e15835</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kittelmann M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-2720</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d4247ccc100.58232824</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>30BD2F07-38FC-4591-9739-5919E7205E03</gtr:id><gtr:title>The endoplasmic reticulum: a dynamic and well-connected organelle.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of integrative plant biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/13d4ca1391951e001eb91f904dfb0087"><gtr:id>13d4ca1391951e001eb91f904dfb0087</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hawes C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1672-9072</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545c91a91eb493.17256775</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A125B529-AF42-4DA5-90E2-624D61BDAC7A</gtr:id><gtr:title>A C-terminal amphipathic helix is necessary for the in vivo tubule-shaping function of a plant reticulon.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a01237ceb822dfea19d8ade04c902657"><gtr:id>a01237ceb822dfea19d8ade04c902657</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Breeze E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>589b4a22e96d36.07351833</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EA863334-977B-42DC-B68E-EFE511DF2700</gtr:id><gtr:title>The odd one out: Arabidopsis reticulon 20 does not bend ER membranes but has a role in lipid regulation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/33eeac8ae489bede2eb2fe098055e31d"><gtr:id>33eeac8ae489bede2eb2fe098055e31d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kriechbaumer V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9591cbbf1e59.32174067</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M000168/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DA052B9-38AC-4F23-88FA-66C8DEB08B81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organelles &amp; components</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>253CB9C6-598F-4333-BA30-5DB46A2E68A0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
