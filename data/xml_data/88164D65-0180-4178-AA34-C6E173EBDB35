However, there are still many global challenges to be addressed. These complex development challenges require open, innovative systems driven by research and evidence. To have impact, this research must must be taken up, not only by researchers, but also by policymakers and practitioners. In their pursuit to produce relevant, useful research towards sustainable development, research producers in the field are invested in understanding how their work is used by diverse audiences. As such, they are eager to develop efficient ways to measure wider societal impact, in order to inform their strategies around research focus, funding, communication and reporting.

Currently development research institutions use a range of tools to measure the importance and influence of the research they produce. For example, expert peer review can be used to assess quality, quantitative metrics can hint at influence, and case studies can indicate effects on policy. However, measuring wider impact on policymakers and practitioners is difficult and often slow and inefficient, and each of these tools have strengths and limitations. Against the backdrop of the digital economy and big data, alternative metrics of impact have grown rapidly as a way of measuring impact beyond academia. 'Altmetrics' are tools designed to gauge the impact of diverse research outputs on diverse audiences. Capitalising on the huge growth of social media and social networking, altmetrics provide new data: (a) mentions in policy documents, blogs, news, Wikipedia, (b) social media 'shares' (e.g. Twitter, Facebook), and (c) social 'bookmarks' (e.g. Mendeley, ResearchGate). These tools have grown rapidly in the last five years, and have now been taken up by influential universities and publishers. Thus, it is crucial to examine their growing role in the current research context.

This project will investigate the effects of altmetrics for multilateral aid agencies. Multilaterals are dominant research centres, but the production, dissemination and uptake of their research are poorly understood. Strongly invested in understanding how their work is utilised by users around the world, these agencies have begun to gather evidence from altmetric sources. Yet, the value of these tools is unclear and often controversial, despite their potential to provide more nuanced and timely understanding of impact in policy and practice contexts. The multilateral agencies I will work with on this project are engaged with altmetrics to varying degrees, but remain stalled in internal debate about their use.

As the first sociological study on the effects of altmetrics for knowledge production in institutions, the project will generate a wealth of new qualitative and quantitative data through an innovative methodological approach. The project seeks to: (i) determine the nature and effects of altmetrics in multilateral agencies, (ii) inform the goals and strategies of research and policy institutes, and (iii) expand knowledge in sociology, research evaluation, research policy, and development studies. This project will meet its aims through (i) two comparative ethnographic case studies, (ii) network analysis using altmetric data, and (iii) supplementary interviews with research producers and users. This novel methodological combination will allow me to chart the networks of research impact, but also, crucially, to capture the complexity of meanings and practices surrounding altmetric use. Using a novel sociological, mixed-methods framework, this project will provide new theoretical and empirical insights to understand the use of alternative metrics of impact in the global policy context. These contributions will be delivered through a number of academic and user-focused outputs, towards better utilisation of knowledge and evidence in addressing global challenges.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Understanding the impact of research is important to multilateral and government agencies, as well as organisations in the research, third and private sectors. This project aims to inform the strategies of research/policy institutes across these sectors, with the goal of supporting policymaking and practice. During each stage of the research, I will continue to liaise with the co-producers, collaborators and beneficiaries of this project. Impact activities will deliver short term outputs for medium and long term outcomes. Benefits to sectors are described below, and are marked with their corresponding deliverable:

1. Multilateral sector: Multilaterals are invested in understanding how research can influence global policy and how policy can make better use of research (i.e. how their outputs are used around the world, and how to appropriately use this information).
- Case study agencies will gain a detailed understanding of their networks of research impact, and will gain insights into the cultural and institutional effects of impact measurement systems (via network analysis, case study reports, feedback)
- Multilateral agencies at large (e.g. IMF) will learn of the risks, opportunities, and best practices of using altmetrics (best practice report, user forum, half-day course)

2. Public sector: UK's DFID spends over &amp;pound;11 billion on Development Assistance and &amp;pound;320 million on development research [3]. However, evaluators have noted an inability to turn learning into action. Thus, understanding the translation of research into policy and practice is crucial. 
- Research and evaluation directors in state agencies (e.g. DFID, Australia's DFAT) will have better understanding of how to maximise research impact through networks, and how to implement measurement strategies that promote influence (best practice report, user forum, website, half-day course) 
- Policymakers and program managers will gain a better understanding of how research quality and influence is determin, to inform evidence-based policies and programs (best practice report, user forum, website)
- Improving bilateral and multilateral research and policy processes can indirectly affect the quality of aid and development programs in developing countries (case &amp;amp; best practice reports)

3. Research sector:
- Research funders, policymakers, administrators and publishers will gain insights into best practice (E.g. DFID and HEFCE will gain insights into altmetrics in the context of the R4D initiative and the REF, respectively) (user forum, best practice report, half-day course, feedback) 
- Research management and administration (e.g. Research Strategy Offices) will gain understandings of best practice impact measurement (best practice report, user forum, half-day course, feedback for software)
- PhD and postdoctoral researchers will learn about maximising their personal influence through research-specific social networking (research impact course)
- Insights into impact measurement will be relevant to research sectors in developing countries (best practice report, user forum)

4. Third sector: Think tanks, charities and NGOs (e.g. Oxfam) engaged in development research, policy or practice will gain greater insight into the cultural and relational nature of research output, uptake and impact (user forum, half-day course, website) 

5. Private sector: Private entities (e.g. CDC Group, Oxford Policy Management), including development finance institutions, will gain an understanding of the use of altmetrics in R&amp;amp;D initiatives (user forum, half-day course, website)

This project will thus provide a wide range of organisations and individuals with specific insights on the nature and value of relational measures of impact (via network analysis) as well as crucially, the organisational effects of using alternative metrics (via ethnography) which will allow them to make strategic decisions towards their goal of producing knowledge for sustainable development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173643</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N016319/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8CC9ACAA-4A24-446D-BBF3-573F0B1478E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Organisations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
