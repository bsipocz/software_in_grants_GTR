Sets of recommendations will be specific to different farm types or landscape types, and will build upon detailed scientific understanding of underlying ecological processes.

In the last ten years, scientists have described how ecosystems provide services that are essential for food production, such as clean water, a healthy soil and good climate, pollination and pest control. They are measuring these services and how much they are worth to society, and beginning to understand how important a variety of species and habitats is for providing the services. The big gap is translating all this knowledge into practical advice for commercial farmers. 

The research takes two approaches. The first approach will develop a sophisticated decision support tool that incorporates a wide range of scientific knowledge, some of it very uncertain, into the cost-sensitive decisions that farm managers have to make about how to manage land. This will compare the effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services of a range of different land management options, including possible crop rotations, interventions to support biodiversity and interventions to increase yield. It will consider the costs (or the available profits) of the alternative options, and produce an optimal strategy that maximises biodiversity and ecosystem value whilst retaining viable profit. When the science is uncertain, the software tool will allow the researcher to find out whether this matters to the ultimate decision or not. For example, if we can't be sure exactly how much pollination of oilseed rape is enhanced by providing nectar and pollen margins, does this make a difference to whether or not farmers should incorporate pollen and nectar margins, given that these margins have a range of other known benefits but involve a loss of yield due to reduced cropping area? Of course, the solutions will be sensitive to the costs built into the model, but these will be developed in partnership with commercial agronomists and will be as realistic as possible.

The second approach will develop a package of agri-environment measures to support beneficial insects in a range of different farm types. Beneficial insects provide two ecosystem services - pollination for insect-pollinated crops and some pest control service on all crops. Supporting these services in farmland is complex. Both are delivered by a variety of free-living mobile organisms. The actual insect species involved varies from place to place and from year to year, and the different species need different resources, such as adult food, food for their young, overwintering sites or hunting grounds. The researcher will devise a set of indicator species for delivering these services in orchards, soft fruit farms, arable farms and horticulture. The indicator set will cover all major resource needs and incorporate any specialised reliance on particular resources. For the indicator species set in each farming type, the research will then pool relevant ecological knowledge, including population modelling where available, and expert assessment to produce a set of agri-environment options that provide the appropriate amount and arrangement of resources to support delivery of pollination and pest control from the natural ecosystem.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Research Fellowship has been designed from the outset to meet two clearly defined business and policy evidence needs, identified by NERC-funded knowledge exchange activities. These are:

1 - How can commercial farmers improve management of biodiversity and ecosystem services on their land? This has been identified independently during bilateral discussions with Waitrose Ltd and AB Sustain.

2 - What do farmers have to do to be sure they are supporting pollinators and natural pest control services? This was identified during a knowledge exchange workshop by a number of farmer-focussed organisations and has since been strongly supported as a need in policy development by Natural England.

As the applicant will work directly with the organisations making these demands throughout the period of the Fellowship, the project is expected to generate substantial impact, both for the methods it develops and for the research projects and databases it uses. 

For example, the project contributes to the development of a modelling tool being built by AB Sustain (a division of AB Agri), to measure and enhance ecosystem services on farms. This tool is likely to be rolled out to growers widely, through relationships with one or more large retailers. AB Sustain's farm carbon management tool is used exclusively by Sainsbury's to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on 300 UK farms. The new tool for ecosystem services will take a similar approach to management, using benchmarking and year on year improvements to value. The product can be expected to make a substantial contribution to improving the sustainability of agriculture in the UK and potentially in other parts of the world serving the UK food market. This project will ensure that BESS science on the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem service delivery, and the measurement and management of ecosystem services will feed directly into this new modelling tool. 

The Beneficial Insects Package developed as part of the project already has the involvement of a number of organisations that work directly with growers to enhance agricultural sustainability. These include the Campaign for the Farmed Environment, Linking Environment and Farming (LEAF), the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and Conservation Grade. All these organisation speak enthusiastically about the effectiveness of the farmland bird package as a tool for encouraging farmers to implement available schemes. They are entirely behind the Beneficial Insects Package and can offer a number of possible routes for publicising it and rolling it out on a large scale. The direct involvement of Natural England in the project means not only that the package itself could be endorsed by them, but also that a similar approach could be used as the basis for other ecosystem-service focussed packages in a newly designed policy set. 

The real impact, in both these examples, will be changes in the management of commercial farms to take greater account of maintaining ecosystem services that directly add value to food production. This could be increased uptake of certain crop rotations in response to demonstration of benefits in a commercial context by RobOff, for example. It could be enhanced uptake of certain combinations of agri-environment measures with appropriate spatial arrangements and scale. Currently, the main pollinator measure, nectar and pollen mix, has low uptake rates and its implementation is scattered. The work could also lead to increased uptake of agri-environment measures amongst some farm types. Agri-environment schemes are reported by industry to be unpopular amongst commercial fruit growers, for example.

Throughout the research, the Fellow will be explaining the research processes to non-scientists, thus retaining a transparent link between the farm management solutions that emerge and the underlying biodiversity science that supports them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sainsbury plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sainsbury's workshop on biodiversity</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB9BE579-46D2-46C6-B891-FD824D576E41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sainsbury's are in the process of developing a new biodiversity strategy, informed by the outcomes from the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462580f5ecc59.80742546-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sainsbury's fresh produce team provided the venue, the catering and invited all the delegates to the workshop.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A one-day workshop hosted by Sainsbury's and delivered by the University of Cambridge in May 2014.

European agriculture policy

The analysis of the biodiversity impacts of the new European CAP (Dicks et al. 2014; Pe'er et al. 2014) was widely publicised and was cited in a European policy briefing note (Altmayer 2016). Lynn Dicks has been invited to present the work at a series of three workshops about the Common Agricultural Policy in 2016 and 2017, organised by the European Commission Directorates DG Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre. These workshops are attended by European Commission officials and influence decision-making about the future changes to Common Agricultural Policy after 2020.

The method of evidence assessment developed in this project has been of strong interest to the Joint Research Centre's Food Security Unit (JRC Ispra). The method is being incorporated into a software tool, the Ecological Focus Areas Calculator (http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/efa/) previously developed by JRC with the University of Hertfordshire. The EFA calculator is used by the JRC to evaluate whether the Ecological Focus Areas element in compulsory greening of the Common Agricultural Policy 2014-2020, has been effective at delivering intended environmental benefits at European scale. It can also be used by individual farmers or supply companies, to assess, manage and maximise benefits they can gain from adhering to the Ecological Focus Areas requirement.

The work on the costs of farmland conservation actions was described in a regular environmental science briefing for European policymakers (Science for Environment Policy 2016) 

National and international policy on pollinators

Two outputs from this research (Dicks et al. 2015; Dicks, Walsh, and Sutherland 2014) are cited in the IPBES Thematic Assessment on Pollinators and Pollination (IPBES 2016a), an international policy document. The assessment report was formally endorsed by the 196 Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at the 13th Conference of the Parties (COP13) in Mexico (Convention on Biological Diversity 2016). The CBD decision specifically cites the actions listed in a table in the Summary for Policymakers (written by Dr Lynn Dicks), and encourages parties to use these actions to help guide their efforts to improve conservation and management of pollinators, address drivers of pollinator declines, and work towards sustainable food production systems and agriculture.

At the 13th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD CoP13) in Cancun, Mexico, December 2017, 13 countries signed a declaration called a &amp;quot;Coalition of the Willing&amp;quot;, indicating their willingness to take action nationally and internationally on pollinators. The signatories are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Peru, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Uruguay. Two of these countries already have national pollinator strategies (UK, France), through which many actions are promoted and encouraged that improve conditions for wild and managed pollinators in farmed and urban areas. The other 11 countries are interested and/or actively developing national pollinator strategies. This declaration will help them learn from each other and shape the strategies. The text of the document, provided in this website http://promotepollinators.org/ includes a list of &amp;quot;essentials for national pollinator strategies&amp;quot; which very strongly draw on the ten policies for pollinators suggested by Dicks et al. (2016). The paper (Dicks, Viana, et al. 2016) was circulated in hard copy at CBD CoP15, and was itself developed from the evidence assessed in the IPBES pollinators report (IPBES 2016b), which is directly cited by the Coalition of the Willing.

National agri-environment schemes

The research on floral resource needs for common pollinators was used to guide development of a new agri-environment scheme for England, Countryside Stewardship, which has a Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package. Dicks et al. (2015) describes the evidence underlying the package and was co-authored with key Natural England staff developing the Package.

Natural England has actively promoted the Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package, with funding from Defra as part of the National Pollinator Strategy for England. 40% of all Mid-Tier Countryside Stewardship agreements with January 2016 start dates are delivering the Package in full and over 60% of all agreements are putting in land management options expected to benefit wild pollinators directly (Defra 2017).

BUSINESS IMPACT

Informing farm management with evidence

An assessment of the effectiveness of actions to enhance natural pest regulation (Dicks, Wright, et al. 2016) was conducted in association with the Waitrose Agronomy Group. This work identified the 'push-pull' system of using trap and repellent plants to manage crop pests as the most effective action from a set of 20. The findings are presented on the Waitrose Sustainable Agriculture Portal (www.sustainableagriculturewaitrose.org). As an example of influencing practice, one of the first wave of PhD research projects planned for the Waitrose-led BBSRC Collaborative Training Partnership will develop and test a new push-pull system to control leaf miners in field spinach crops in East Anglia. This research was proposed by a Waitrose spinach supplier.

The Cool Farm Tool is an industry-led environmental decision-support tool used by members of the Cool Farm Alliance (www.coolfarmtool.org). The current focus is to develop a suite of tools according to the elements of farm-scale sustainability performance assessment identified by the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (http://www.saiplatform.org/). With additional support from a NERC BESS Programme Knowledge Exchange grant (NE/M000206/1), this project developed a biodiversity module for the Cool Farm Tool. It uses a scoring system to rapidly assess overall management of biodiversity, based on rigorous, unbiased assessment of evidence for the effectiveness of specific actions (Dicks et al. in prep). The Cool Farm Biodiversity module was integrated into the online Cool Farm Tool, with funding from the Cool Farm Alliance. It has so far been tested by Unilever, the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and FarmCare Ltd. Ultimately, Cool Farm Biodiversity will gather data and improve on-farm biodiversity management on thousands of farms in European supply chains. There is strong interest in funding further developments to extend the geographic coverage, for example to New Zealand, the Mediterranean biome and tropical forest areas.

The method involves assessing collated evidence using a panel of experts and stakeholders, who follow a formal consensus method with several rounds of independent scoring known as the Delphi process. We used the method to assess evidence for the effects on farm wildlife of compulsory greening measures in the new European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). We found they were largely unlikely to be effective, although some specific Ecological Focus Area measures could benefit wildlife. This assessment was used as part of a wider analysis of the biodiversity effects of the new CAP, published in Science and entitled 'EU Agricultural Policy Reform Fails on Biodiversity'.

Along with other collaborators, we tested the method for actions to enhance natural pest regulation (predation of pests by spiders for example). This work identified the 'push-pull' system of using trap and repellent plants to manage crop pests as the most effective action from a set of 20. We have also used the evidence assessment method to translate evidence on managing farms for biodiversity into a commercial farmer-focused decision support system called the Cool Farm Tool.

I estimated costs of different farm management or conservation actions, with collaborators at the University of Helsinki, and identified a set of sixteen actions that are low cost and could be promoted as voluntary actions for farmers and the public (Santangeli et al. 2016). This work implies that the voluntary, non-monetary approach to conversation could be widely applicable.

In 2013 and 2014, I worked with Natural England to help develop the Wild Pollinators and Farm Wildlife Package, part of the new agri-environment schemes (Dicks et al. 2015). The work assessed which key bee species the scheme should concentrate on, what was limiting populations of these species and what agri-environment schemes could do that would be sufficient to support them. I devised a novel approach to estimate areas of flower-rich habitat required by crop pollinators, using a 'flower demand model' based on empirically measured pollen demands of individual bee larvae. The analysis showed that providing flower-rich habitat on 2 % of farmed land and 1 km of flowering hedgerow per 100 ha can supply six key pollinator species with enough pollen to feed their larvae (at low estimates of pollen demand).

The underlying concept of designing conservation actions to deliver quantified resource needs of target species had not been applied in pollinator conservation before. The same approach could be used for other insect groups, including declining species, for example, or natural enemies.

Lynn Dicks (the grant holder) was an invited speaker at the first two events, held in London on Monday 11th February 2013, and at Osterley Park, Middlesex, on 18 June 2104. She presented an approach to devising an evidence-based agri-environment package for beneficial insects, a project proposed and supported by the Pollinator Conservation Delivery Group funded by a Knowledge Exchange grant (NE/J500665/1), and being carried out under another grant (NE/K015419/1). At a third workshop, held at the RSPB, Sandy, Bedfordshire, on 5 September 2014, Lynn Dicks was one of only two academic researchers present.

These workshops were organised by Natural England staff directly involved in designing new agri-environment scheme options and packages, for implementation as part of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy for 2015. The discussions and presentations directly informed the design of the new schemes. 

The Countryside Stewardship Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package was publicly launched on 4th November 2014 as part of the National Pollinator Strategy for England. It is specifically designed to support pollinators, wild birds and rare arable plants, and will be supported by an additional &amp;pound;350,000 from Defra.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2008391601.97264676253939c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/370199/pb14221-national-pollinator-strategy.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators (11 countries)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAC33193-7253-4DA0-860D-841582BE298A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At the 13th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD CoP13) in Cancun, Mexico, December 2017, 13 countries signed a declaration called a &amp;quot;Coalition of the Willing&amp;quot;, indicating their willingness to take action nationally and internationally on pollinators. The signatories are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Peru, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Uruguay. Two of these countries already have national pollinator strategies (UK, France), through which many actions are being promoted and encouraged that improve conditions for wild and managed pollinators in farmed and urban areas. The other 11 countries are interested and/or actively developing national pollinator strategies and this declaration will help them learn from each other, and help shape the strategies.

The text of the document, provided in this website http://promotepollinators.org/ includes a list of &amp;quot;essentials for national pollinator strategies&amp;quot; which very strongly draw on the ten policies for pollinators suggested by Dicks et al.

With additional support from a BESS Programme Knowledge Exchange grant (NE/M000206/1), we have developed a biodiversity module for the Cool Farm Tool. It uses a scoring system for farms to rapidly assess their overall management of biodiversity, based on rigorous, unbiased assessment of evidence for the effectiveness of specific actions (Dicks et al.

The tool is currently in the process of being integrated into the online Cool Farm Tool by the software company Anthesis Group, funded directly by the Cool Farm Alliance.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C11A3C3F-6338-4DB0-9E35-76119C58BDCB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Cool Farm Biodiversity module has so far been tested by Unilever, the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and FarmCare. Ultimately, this software tool will gather data and potentially improve on-farm biodiversity management on thousands of farms in European supply chains.

A New Zealand Government-funded project called 'The Sustainability Dashboard' has approached us and is planning to fund and develop a New Zealand version of the tool.
