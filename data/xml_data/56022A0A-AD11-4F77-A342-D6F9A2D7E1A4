As a result of new technologies for molecular investigation, the composition of the genome and the various organisational layers that exist between the genome and organismic response to the environment are now better described. These organisational layers, known as 'omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc), are now accessible for investigation in their entirety. This scope of investigation has not only opened unparalleled opportunities for a more complete understanding of how organisms or communities interact with the environment but also created an informatics challenge unprecedented in environmental biology. With technical advances in instrumentation, the sheer volume of data generated by 'omics investigation is orders of magnitude higher that has been the norm in environmental biology, creating new challenges for data storage, data analysis, and indeed optimisation of data structures generally. At the same time, important new opportunities for innovation in addressing critical problems can arise from the effective blending of bioinformatics and environmental 'omics. 
To leverage the full potential of these developments to deliver its strategy, 'Next Generation Science for Planet Earth', the NERC has established a virtual Environmental 'Omics Synthesis Centre to facilitate the coalescence and emergence of novel scientific approaches to environmental 'omics. EOS is tasked with enabling the emergence of novel scientific synthesis within the NERC community that might benefit from environmental 'omics as well as contribute to its development. STFC has a well-established infrastructure for addressing complex data on the scale that is likely to be generated through future investigations in environmental 'omics. Therefore there is substantial potential for synergism between the emerging need for enhanced scale of bioinformatics approaches to environmental 'omics as indentified by the NERC and the existing facilities base in the STFC, to the benefit of both.
The present STFC Global Networks call provides a timely opportunity for the development of strong connections between STFC and NERC interests in environmental sciences. Indeed, the bioinformatics challenge presented by environmental 'omics was specifically highlighted at the second STFC Environment Futures Workshop (http://www.stfc.ac.uk/resources/pdf/FuturesEnv2Report.pdf). The NERC EOS is just now being established, so that network building with STFC scientists at this stage will ensure that the extensive resource base of the STFC will be an integral part of bioinformatics and environmental 'omics as collaboration between these fields is developed over the next five years.
We plan to conduct two workshops per year, addressing in each case targeted research areas where there is anticipated potential for synergy between STFC and NERC. At the outset, indicative workshop themes for exploring joint STFC and NERC development of the potential of bioinformatics and environmental 'omics include:
a) Novel data structures, novel algorithms and ontologies. The bioinformatics challenges raised by environmental 'omics are widely recognised, but both the detailed nature of these challenges and effective approaches for addressing them require further development. 
b) Linking environmental 'omics to other large scale data structures and models, for example those involving climate and other major environmental cycles.
c) The interplay between environmental biological processes and human health, for example environmental toxicology and environmental pollution as a source of health-threatening antimicrobial resistance.
d) Modelling complex biological interactions underlying basic ecosystem services and their resilience to environmental change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the STFC/NERC Bioinformatics &amp;amp; Environmental 'Omics Network tackles significant environmental issues by identifying ways to harness the combined power of bioinformatics and environmental 'omics, beneficiaries will include industry and government - and, indeed, in the broadest sense, the environment. Because the Network will from its very start bring together researchers with individuals from the private sector and government to explore future possibilities for solutions to pressing themes, the UK will have a head start in development of related innovation and understanding. As just one example, a workshop on the interplay between environmental biological processes and human health will explore the potential for collaboration on issues such as health-threatening antimicrobial resistance that are of interest to pharmaceutical and other companies, as well as to agencies committed to environmental regulation or public health. Each of the Network workshops is expected to spark follow-on research collaborations that will lead to novel findings relevant to such themes as: development of novel data structures; novel algorithms and ontologies; the interplay between environmental biological processes and human health; climate and other major environmental cycles; complex biological interactions underlying basic ecosystem services and their resilience to environmental change. Innovation within each of these themes can lead to both academic and non-academic impacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239646</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Developing integrated multi-level models of the environment, Univerrsity of Liverpool, 8-9 March 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FCBFAB6D-96AE-4498-BFE7-C7C7DE05E362</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was sponsored by our project and was organised by a member of our network, Prof Francisco Falciani and a NERC EOS Fellow, Dr Phllip Antczak.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6dd4176be58.33083659</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Remote sensing technology to support sustainability and conservation, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, 18-19 February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9ACD23FF-9433-458C-9AB4-D0AE4574C808</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Remote sensing technologies have advanced to a potential position of prominence in investigation of biological properties of ecosystems at a large, even global, scale.

Thus, research in environmental 'omics requires novel approaches that are inherently equipped to deal with data diversity and complexity.
The scientific workflow approach provides the potential to address the biological complexity inherent to environmental omics. A scientific workflow is a series of linked components, such as data computation, manipulation and analysis, used in scientific problem-solving. Scientific workflows help to visualise the flow of data through (potentially) complex computations in a user-friendly way. 
Biological systems can manifest complexity in many ways. For example, integration of genomic information across multiple species in a particular ecosystem, now feasible due to advances in genome sequencing technology, can be coupled with information about functional domains within genomes -- and their context dependent properties within specific organisms -- to match genomic information to larger scale processes of adaptation and ecosystem function. One of the challenges of integration across multiple levels is that information available at each level is dynamic and also subject to changing biological interpretation, such as changing understanding of genome function or changing taxonomic classification that refines knowledge of the evolutionary history of the system. Viewing this complexity through a workflow approach allows not only identification and interpretation of higher-order emergent properties of complex systems, but also the ability to integrate models that take into account changing information..
In this first workshop of the STFC/NERC Bioinformatics &amp;amp; Environmental 'Omics Network, we will be exploring the nature of workflow approaches and how they can be applied to specific scientific challenges in the realm of 'omics. Future workshops will address more targeted scientific themes, building on methodological approaches considered in this inaugural workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e04dc8931f56.73434936</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://environmentalomics.org/workflows/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Using remote sensing in the study of Amazonian Ecosystems, 2nd TPI Network Workshop, Porto Velho, RO, Brazil, 23-24 February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A544D869-3746-4CBE-86A4-67E840D6761B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was co-sponsored by the STFC/NERC Bioinformatics and Environmental 'Omics.

This is particularly true for data intensive areas such as environmental omics, where large datasets are likely to reside in centralised storage facilities, such as Jasmin, EBI, or ELIXIR. Cloud-based computing allows users to analyse such data on HPC systems by creating 'instance-based' computer images that can be ported directly to the computer system where such data resides. Thus, users can access big data and analyse it using the full power of remote HPC facilities while at the same time using a familiar interface with customised software. Thus, cloud-based computing has the potential to combine accessible and customised interfaces with the full computational power and storage capacity of state-of-the-art HPC systems. 

This workshop will explore the current state of cloud-based computing facility and what steps are needed to bring the full power of cloud-based computing to the wider scientific community, including environmental omics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e04b1a6674e2.23085785</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://environmentalomics.org/cloud-computing/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Archaeogenomics, University of Warwick, 28-29 April 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3774BE19-96B3-4F3B-99FD-002B4A5AC54E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Archaeogenomics in Environmental Science was an STFC/NERC-supported workshop at the University of Warwick in April, 2016, bringing together specialists in ancient DNA based genomics and related fields to develop interdisciplinary goals and collaborative efforts. Thirteen institutions from the UK and abroad were represented by 29 participants spanning environmental 'omics and science-based archaeology

A key workshop goal was to discuss of methodological and subject areas for the development of overarching Highlight Topics ideas based on long-term archaeological and biomolecular 'omic data. Themes from the meetings emerged as i) resilience of biodiversity to human impact, ii) competing interests in food species evolution in a changing environment, iii) leveraging databases and multi-informatic resources, and iv) coping with catastrophic change. The overarching emergent key theme was the utility of the long-term biomolecular record to understand resilience and adaptation to a changing environment.

In summary, archaeogenomics is well-positioned to contextualize modern environmental and social challenges in light of long-term patterns in the biomolecular record.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6df51e2de92.97566418</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>70000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NERC Field Spectroscropy</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8D857424-9C88-4A97-BA7D-B2E13D90FB5B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c844a1c69660.48459362</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>43341</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Global Challenges Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C50FAF5C-6B81-41C0-8EEB-70539090D6CB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0478b496cf1.38189876</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>49299</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Global Futures Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0D762313-6C9D-4A13-ADB1-892B3DCB0B3B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e045a42cd0b4.22604216</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>38422</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Global Futures Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ST/P003281/1 and ST/P003265/1, joint submission</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>F82B0AFB-7754-4CC8-B73C-6DDE0967ED62</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c8437b4bfef7.47301480</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have led to three successful funding applications: STFC Global Challenges grant (phylogenetic computation Barker, Winn, Meagher), remote sensing (two STFC Global Futures grants), and a GCRF application that was not successful in the first round but remains a collaboration under development.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5411750C-C3E8-4FF2-AF16-F88CF20FDA93</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546613876155b5.79527113</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have completed networking workshops addressing computer workflow models and miniaturisation for field genomic analysis.
