In only three years, RSEs have begun to achieve recognition in the UK research community, RSE Groups have sprung up at universities around the country, and RSE activities have attracted worldwide attention. The UK leads the world in understanding the importance of the RSE role to research.

The RSE community grows with each success, but this also increases the difficulty of ensuring adequate communication and sharing occurs across groups, and this increases the risk of duplicating effort and even repeating mistakes. We must invest into administering and organising across the RSE community if we are to extract the greatest value from the UK's investment into RSEs and maintain our position as a world leader in this field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>RSE Fellows will benefit from having instant access to the accumulated experience of the RSE community, including the experience of the RSE Leaders network who will have faced very similar issues to those faced by the Fellows.

RSE organisations will benefit from the sharing that the RSEN will engender and the administration assistance that the network will provide.

RSEs will benefit because the organisations that represent them will be able to achieve their goals more efficiently. Ultimately this will lead to their recognition and reward within the research community.

Policymakers and research stakeholders will benefit from access to an annual &amp;quot;state of the nation&amp;quot; report about RSEs, which can be used to understand the impact of RSEs and how best to support them.

By increasing the number of people with skills in both research and software engineering, the commercial sector will benefit from a wider talent pool from which to employ.

The greater public and the UK economy will benefit from advanced research that will result from supporting RSEs and providing the recognition and reward they deserve for their contribution to research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80263</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panel on data science careers</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FFA9F427-D340-4E5B-ADAD-901D909EB696</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following the success of the first RSE conference, Simon Hettrick was invited by the Moore and Sloan Foundations to attend a summit for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments, held in New York in November 2016.

This shows the shear level of interest in this new discipline that it can attract such a widespread audience on its first outing. The conference sold out over a month before the event took place and generated enough income to assure the following year's conference.

It was obvious that the community was intent on the conference being a success: almost all publicity was gained through the actions of the UK RSE Association's members. Feedback from the conference was excellent, with 95% of attendees expecting to attend the next conference and 100% reporting that they would recommend the conference to others.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b0a06c5eb3.37342155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ukrse.github.io/conf2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New RSE website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3489743-E6C8-4B58-B476-78117ED498A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The original UK RSE Association's website was put together on a best effort basis. As this community has grown in number and significance, it badly needed a facelift so as the better represent the work of the Association. Over late 2016 to early 2017, a small team worked to completely update the website. With over 10,000 people visiting the site in 2016 alone, it was vital that we updated the site to continue to grow visitor numbers and publicise the RSE campaign and the UK's world-leading role in it.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6bb41d839d4.01551048</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rse.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Introduction to Research Software Engineers community for Internet2</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9ED42532-8102-4F2A-807D-4A5723BF4F1D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Simon Hettrick was invited to summarise the UK's work with the RSE community at Internet2's cyberpracticioners' workshop. Internet2 brought together many of the leading universities in the US to discuss how to support people who work in research but write code, not papers. Interest in the talk was such that it was extended into the second day of the workshop so that attendees would have time to ask their questions. Following the workshop a report was written by the organisers that detailed the UK's world-leading role in support this vital group of people working in research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b927478d59.09895428</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://meetings.internet2.edu/2016-07-cyberpractitioner-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The RSEN began in January 2016, so it is early days for the project. Despite this fact, there has been a significant increase in RSE activities thanks to the support the network has provided. Most importantly, we quickly recruited a coordinator for the project and she has provided the logistical support the RSE community sorely needed. This has meant that 2016 saw a huge increase in the number of activities taking place in the RSE community and the outcomes from those activities being better publicised.

The main beneficiaries of the RSEN in 2016 have been the RSE Leaders group, which has met regularly every six months thanks to the RSEN's support. This has allowed the EPSRC's RSE Fellows to better integrated into the RSE community and is leading to the creation of guidance from this expert group. For example, for guidance on how to set up a new RSE group at a university and for the EPSRC on recruiting the next year's RSE Fellows.

The UKRSE Association's committee has met every month by Skype, with two face to face meetings already taking place, since it was installed September 2016. This is a huge increase in interaction over the previous committee, partly due to a change in the committee and partly due to an increase in interest about the RSE campaign thanks in part to the RSEN.

The greatest impact from the RSEN so far is undoubtably the RSE conference which brought a 202 people together from 14 different countries. This highly successful conference could not have taken place without the RSEN's initial support, both in providing seed funding and in providing organisational effort. The conference alone did more to promote the RSE cause than much of the work completed thus far in the campaign. It's impact was felt internationally across a number of disciplines.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3997B484-9D63-4996-A049-7ACBCE77DF2A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c6bfc0876726.90175131</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N028902/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
