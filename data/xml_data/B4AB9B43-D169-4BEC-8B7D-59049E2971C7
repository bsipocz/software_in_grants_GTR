We are interested in tests that predict everyday problems. Such tests are described as being ecologically valid. A number of ecologically valid tests now exist. Several tests have been published by this group including the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (Wilson et al 1985) which has been translated into 14 languages, the Behavioural Inattention Test (Wilson et al 1987), the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (Wilson et al 1996) and the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (Shiel et al 2000). The latest test to be published is a test of prospective memory (remembering to do things). This is The Cambridge Test of Prospective Memory or the Camprompt (Wilson et al 2005). We are hoping to publish a test to measure difficulties in divided attention or doing two things at once. A new test of implicit memory (remembering without conscious recollection) is to be published by the end of 2007. We are currently working on a test to monitor recovery from Post Traumatic Amnesia (the confused state that people find themselves in after traumatic brain injury).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>General Aims: Relevance: Health Issues. One of the most crucial components of all scientific research is the sensitivity, validity and reliability of the tools for measurement. Measurement instruments fitting these criteria are often particularly difficult to establish in the field of cognitive neuroscience, where the underlying processes are as yet so poorly understood. Furthermore, tasks/tests developed in the laboratory often bear little relationship to the ways in which these underlying cognitive processes - like various forms of memory - are actually used in the service of real-life, everyday behaviour. Precise Scientific Objectives. The goal of this project is to develop ecologically valid tests to predict behaviour outside the laboratory or clinic. Plan of investigation. We test a group of people without brain injury to establish normal performance on each of our new tests and then we test a group of people with brain injury. We look at ages ranging from 16 - 65 and in some cases assess older people too. We also assess people of above average, average and below average intellectual ability. An ecologically valid test of prospective memory was published in 2005. The test comprises six subtests each concerned with a prospective memory task analogous to a real life situation. Three of the subtests are event-based tasks in which participants are asked to carry out a tasks at a given signal (e.g. when an alarm rings) and three are time-based tasks in which participants are asked to carry out a given task at a certain time (e.g. in 5 minutes). In addition we have completed data collection of a new test to identify and understand divided attention deficits in people with brain injury.We had some problems with the analysis and are now deciding whether or not to shorten the test. We hav completed data collection of a new test to monitor recovery from Post Traumatic Amnesia (PTA)and are currently completing data analysis. We have completed the investigation of test-retest reliability of the European Brain Injury Questionnaire and a paper on this is now in press. We have completed data collection on a new test of implicit memory and this test is likely to be published by the end of 2007. Subsequent scientific/medical opportunities. This research is likely to benefit brain injured people by providing more accurate means of identifying cognitive and other deficits. This, in turn, should enable therapists and psychologists to set realistic goals for rehabilitation, to plan their treatment more effectively and to monitor change over time. The project falls within the definition of clinical research, area 1 (patient-based research).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1998-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98330</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U105559860</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>6A8830E7-54E9-46E8-8AF8-96B20A4D9DDC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.5  Resources and infrastructure (prevention)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>3BEA012A-C817-4067-8BE1-05331EBB5152</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.2  Evaluation of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
