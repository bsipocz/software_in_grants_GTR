These companies will be supported by academics at NCEFE (Sheffield Hallam University) developing bran processing and investigation and evaluation of rice husk ash production and application, testing and exploitation in India. The Indian project team has a rice equipment manufacturer and distributor Vishavkarma Machine Tools, rice processor Rajdhani Rice and Kuantum Papers Ltd who will process the rice husks. The team is supported by research institutions IIT Roorkee who will project manage the Indian team and lead the work on rice husk ash utilisation. Punjab Agricultural University and NABI-CIAB will investigate the valorisation and processing of the rice bran. Project description - WP 1 focusses on Project Management of the consortium and delivery of each of the work packages. WP2 Rice milling: Developing the technology to make a step change in rice milling capability. Koolmill will develop new milling capability in cooperation with KMF, NCEFE and East End Foods to significantly enhance rice milling capability and demonstrate the capability of the new process with respect to conventional mills. The technology will be evaluated for implementation in India by Vishavkarma Machine Tools and Rajdhani Rice supported by technical expertise at Punjab Agriculture University. Additional investigations will be conducted by Process Technologies to identify microwave technology to provide high efficiency drying of the rice paddy and bran stabilisation prior to processing. Koolmill will develop enhanced control of bran removal to support the bran exploitation route. Working with KMF, NCEFE and Punjab Agriculture University, Koolmill will investigate the quality standards resulting from the enhanced processes as well as the financial models for the utilisation of the technology in the Indian market. WP3 Bran processing: This work package provides new value and new food products from the rice crop. The WP will research, test and evaluate extraction techniques for proteins and carbohydrates from the rice bran. The initial work will integrate appropriate technology to stabilize the bran. This will be followed by technical development of extraction processes by NCEFE, NABI-CIAB and Marlow Foods. This team will then further exploit these materials into new food products with the additional input by New Food Innovation. WP4 Rice husk ash: An investigation and development of technologies to extract and utilise materials from rice husk ash to exploit in building products. Extending previous work, NCEFE and IIT Roorkee will work with Kuantum Paper Mill and the rice milling operator Rajdhani Rice to refine the capability of burning below 850 degC and gasification of rice husk to produce a safe and reactive amorphous ash for incorporation into building materials (concrete and alkali activated cementitious materials) and products. The alkali activated materials (geopolymers) will not use high CO2 generating Portland cement. WP5 Evaluation of system performance: Working closely with the industrial partners in the UK and India, NCEFE, NABI-CIAB, Punjab Agriculture University and IIT Roorkee will provide access to technical resources that will evaluate the economics, energy consumption efficiency and technical capability of the project's investigations and equipment development in the three main project areas of rice milling capability, bran removal and rice husk ash extraction and utilisation in building materials. WP6 Knowledge Transfer and Dissemination: This activity disseminates the project outcomes, identifies IP exploitation and supports training and education for rice producers and millers in India through national networks and reports the key outcomes from the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outputs of the project will be (i) a novel milling and grain separation technology that will reduce rice brokens by 10%; (ii) A technology for the immediate re-processing of the 7.7MT of rice bran into highly nutritious food ingredients (carbohydrate, protein &amp;amp; fibre); and (iii) a process for separating and processing rice husks into rice husk ash to enhance concrete and other building products.

The 1st challenge is to increase the quantity and value of the yield and by-products to the farming community to support socio-economic growth. The business opportunity is to build upon Koolmill's patented milling technologies to produce high quality bran and husk by-products that can be re-processed into food and construction applications. The aim will be to achieve a 10% reduction in brokens and increase yield by 10.6MT nationally (&amp;pound;5.6-7.5bn)p/a. For India a national roll-out of the rice separation process would increase GDP by 0.35%, and generate an additional &amp;pound;3.71bn for local and regional farming milling communities. The global milling machine market potential is worth &amp;pound;11.25bn p/a and the key players are the global market leader Satake (Japan) and Buhler (Switzerland). Koolmill has patents for its grain separation technology covering 75% of the global rice market. Koolmill technology is the leading solution in power saving and yield improvement, focussed on small/medium size mills. In this segment there is no commercial competitive offering. India has 125,000 of these smaller, traditional operations, who would be the main target segment for the milling process technology. KMF will scale up the machine in partnership with VMT in the Punjab. Both companies estimate an increase in revenues by 10-20% over 5 years. The pilot project will target 3-5 mills, and the cost of one machine is circa &amp;pound;8-10k. Koolmill forecast that a 10% uptake of the milling technology (over 10 years) would generate &amp;pound;360m in machine sales. VMT forecast 20% uptake.

The 2nd element is velop a process to optimise bran outputs from the process. The target is to generate 7.7MT of high nutrition bran p/a, commercially worth an additional &amp;pound;1.5bn p/a to the national economy, that can be sold into the food manufacturing supply chain for high carbohydrate and protein rich foods. Marlow Foods is the UK market leader in mycoprotein food products. They forecast as a result of the project the bran by-products generating &amp;pound;8-10m of revenue, &amp;amp; development of a bran based carbohydrate will result in a further &amp;pound;6m of income. The partners forecast a &amp;pound;8.5m return on &amp;pound;738K investment from IUK in 5 years.

The 3rd opportunity is to recycle the rice husk ash waste into the manufacture of materials for the construction industry. The EBRI report for husk indicates that waste char has a 40% ash content. In India this is yet to be exploited and RHA is sent to landfill. Technology that utilises the RHA as an efficient heterogenous catalyst for industrial applications e.g. the manufacture of concrete and Alkali activated materials will be developed. This opportunity is estimated to be worth &amp;pound;0.9bn.

The project is directly aligned to the ODA's recommendations for India: (i) the proposed technologies can increase the capacity of India's leading agri-food industry, rice, by 10.6MT per year, and reduce sector energy consumption by 80% and deliver potential reduction in CO2 emissions of 2.02MT per annum (ii) support sustainable and inclusive manufacturing for commercial applications of the rice bran and husk by-products to create new business streams for milling companies and resulting in increased job creation in local communities. Conventional mills will increase productivity and yield (iii) It will lead to training and upskilling the local workforce to operate the new machinery and processes. Higher job creation will encourage women into work in safer environments(iv) They will improve health outcomes from high protein/carbohydrate food products.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>323749</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P026206/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE7CEC14-3FA2-49BC-89EE-062447C269C1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Efficiency</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C7A88EDD-F02E-4CF4-B7E9-E33C946EBD49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
