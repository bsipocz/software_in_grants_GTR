Little is known about how this crucial skill develops and at what age it reaches maturity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A large corpus of speech from 120 children aged 8-14 years will be recorded, with pairs of children working cooperatively to complete a ?spot the difference? picture task. The task will be conducted in good and poor listening conditions so as to be able to analyse how children clarify their speech to overcome the communication barrier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will investigate how the ability to produce 'clear' speech develops, whether children make similar acoustic-phonetic enhancements as adults, and whether these vary according to the communication barrier, as in adults. We will relate the perceived clarity of individual speakers to the acoustic-phonetic characteristics of their speech.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This work will help expand models of speech production such as Lindblom?s Hyper-Hypo model. Understanding how children control their speech production is important for developing better strategies for communication with children with hearing or language impairments, and in noisy environments. The LUCID Child corpus, fully transcribed and web-accessible, will be a rich resource for a range of analyses of child speech.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>307179</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media interest (child study)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E6A10DD-5A97-4C44-A1CB-2DB20A2AA6A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our presentation at the Acoustical Society of America conference was one of only 20 selected by the press office for highlighting to the media ('lay language papers').

Our installation aimed to focus attention on how we adapt our speech to communicate effectively in an increasingly noisy world. It also highlighted how noisy environments particularly affect communication in children and older adults. The sound materials used in the installation were extracted from the speech corpora collected within our ESRC-funded projects on speech communication in adverse conditions in children and adults. Each of four audio channels within the installation played the voice of either a child, young or older adult. 
Beyond Words was attended by several thousand people and a steady stream of members of the public of all ages came to experience our sound installation. We were on hand to discuss the work and the science behind it with the audience.

A linked doctoral project investigated speech communication between deaf adolescents and with their peers.
As regards the clinical area of speech and language therapy, the findings of this research provide normative data on the characteristics of spontaneous speech produced by older children and adolescents and how this differ from adult norms. It also provides a normative benchmark for examining the speech of older children with communication difficulties due to e.g. language impairment or hearing loss. A news item publicising the outcome of the study together with a link to the project website with detailed information appeared in the October issue of the Bulletin, the official magazine of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) which has very wide distribution in the profession. We were invited to present an overview of the study at a meeting of the South East Deafness Special Interest Group of the RCSLT in May 2015. The Diapix picture materials used to elicit controlled spontaneous speech in children also have potential for being used in clinical settings with both adults and children. They were publicised to the South East Deafness SIG and made available to clinicians via a Dropbox link. We will continue in our efforts to publicise the availability of these materials.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F45CF441-3A38-4E73-9AFE-60ACA7D23535</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5565d088c29291.52211473</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this project, speech recordings were made for 96 child participants (46M, 50F, range 9;0 to 14;11 years) while they carried out a collaborative 'spot the difference' picture task in pairs, either in good listening conditions or in a condition when perception was deliberately impaired for one of the participants (via vocoded speech or babble noise). The aim was to examine the development of clarification strategies used by children in adverse communicative conditions. 
In a first phase, extensive acoustic-phonetic analyses of the speech produced in the easy and difficult communicative conditions were carried out. Children's conversational speech tended to be more hyperarticulated than in adults, with a larger vowel space, slower articulation rate, higher intensity, higher pitch mean and range, potentially limiting further hyperarticulation in clear speaking styles. Child speakers made acoustic-phonetic adaptations to their speech in difficult communicative conditions but the extent of adaptations was not as great as that seen in adults, and, in the vocoder condition, children made use of certain strategies (increasing pitch range) unlikely to be helpful to counter the speech degradation, while adults used strategies that were more appropriate. The age effect was seen in terms of increasing hypoarticulation in the easy-listening condition rather than increased adaptations when communication was more difficult. 
The impact of the lesser degree of acoustic-phonetic differentiation between conversational and clear speech in children was seen in the perceptual experiments, where listeners were asked to judge the clarity of speech excerpt on a 7 point scale: the difference in clarity scores across speech conditions was significantly lower for children's than adults' speech.
The interactions were also analysed in terms of the repair strategies used by children when a communication breakdown occurred. Older children were more effective at resolving communication breakdowns, as a greater proportion of miscommunications were resolved by a single repair. However, minimal age effects were found in the type of clarification requests used and in repair strategies. 
In another phase of the study, we examined phonetic category structure for two phonetic contrasts to establish whether phonetic categories produced by children within this age range were more internally-variable than adults'. The same child participants produced multiple repetitions of a set of keywords in a picture naming task. Children produced farther yet also much more dispersed categories than adults with increasing discriminability with age, such that by age 13, children's categories were no less discriminable than those of adults.
Overall, this study provides evidence for ongoing developments in certain aspects of speech communication until late teenage years. 

Plans for future research
An ESRC project on speech communication in older adults has been funded (ES/L007002/1). It will expand our exploration of communication in adverse conditions and will use some of the procedures used in the recently completed project. A further ESRC project due to start in June 2017 will take a lifespan approach for the investigation of speech communication in adverse conditions and will build on the research carried out within this project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic users

Non-academic users
A better understanding that the process of speech and language acquisition is still ongoing in teenage years is relevant for Speech and Language Therapists: our kidLUCID corpus and findings provide rare data on spontaneous speech produced in communicative conditions in older typically-developing children. This is an important baseline against which to compare communicative difficulties experienced by youngsters with hearing or language impairments. 

The understanding that communication in challenging conditions has a greater impact on youngsters than on adults is also relevant to educational settings, both in terms of communication in noisy in reverberant environments and communication with peers who may have hearing or language difficulties.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ABCA64FA-FC09-42E0-92B6-F2371B4189BC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54411c57b45807.63176841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/shaps/research/clear-speech-strategies</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This corpus contains high-quality speech recordings for 96 child speakers aged between 9 and 14 years inclusive while they were engaged, in pairs, in an interactive task in good and challenging communicative conditions.
