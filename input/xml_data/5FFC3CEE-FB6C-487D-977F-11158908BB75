The names of individual women poets occasionally crop up in studies of the literature of this period, but there are no studies to date which analyse the breadth or quality of their poetry, the impact it had on the literary scene of the day, the extent to which it conformed to the literary tastes of the period, how it compared to that of their male contemporaries, the training elite women received in poetry, or the role some prominent women played as patrons of male and female poets. The dominant trend in Persian poetry at the beginning of the nineteenth century was neoclassical; a movement which had emerged in the latter part of the 18th century and which was known as the bazgasht or 'return' to a classical, medieval literary style. The poets who were central to the development of this movement were patronized by three of the first four Qajar monarchs: Fath-'Ali Shah (r.1797-1834), Muhammad Shah (1834-1848), and Nasir al-Din Shah (1848-1896) at their opulent court in the new capital, Tehran. Fath-'Ali Shah alone had almost 50 daughters, many of whom were skilled poets. A good deal of their poetry and that of other princesses, wives of the shahs, his granddaughters, and other prominent women of the early to mid-19th century has survived, some of which has recently been published, but almost none of which has been studied by scholars. Through a close reading of this poetry, as well as additional contemporary sources such as court-commissioned histories, this study will seek to illuminate the role played by women in the development of Persian poetry in Iran in the 19th century. The findings of my research will be published in leading refereed journals in the fields of Middle Eastern Studies, Persian/Iranian Studies, and Women's Studies. I will also present my research to mixed academic and non-academic audiences at two conferences: one conference on the contribution of women to the emergence and development of modernist poetry in 19th- and 20th-century Iran to be held at Manchester; and the other a comparative conference on the Ottoman woman to be held at Cambridge. My research findings will also be disseminated via various media outlets, including the BBC World Service and BBC Persian. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I will exploit two main avenues (the media and a conference) to ensure that my research findings benefit a broader, non-academic audience:\n\n1. The Media (in particular the Persian-language media based outside of Iran):\n\nI have spoken with former collegaues in the following media outlets who have expressed interest in using my research findings on women's writing in 19th-century Iran as a topic for a news story or feature:\n\nBBC Persian\nBBC World Service\n\nI worked as a Trainee Producer in the BBC Arabic Service for a year (1998-99), and will also speak to former colleagues there about my research project once I have started to work on my primary sources.\n\nI will also contact two other Persian-language media outlets with large listener bases:\n\nVoice of America's Persian Service\nRadio Farda\n\nI will also speak to a contact who writes for the widely-read Persian newspaper Kayhan based in London to see if he or his colleagues would be interested in interviewing me about my research. \n\n2. An international conference held at Manchester open to the general public: \n\nI am currently in discussions with The Iran Heritage Foundation to convene an international conference at Manchester on the role played by women writers in the emergence and development of modernist poetry and prose in 19th- and 20th-century Iran. Such a conference would give me the opportunity to present my research directly to my academic peers, but it would also be open to the general public, thereby allowing me to reach a broader, non-specialist audience as well. In July 2008 I convened an international conference at Manchester on the leading woman poet of modern Iran, Forugh Farrokhzad (1952-1967), which was funded through a grant of &amp;pound;9,500 from the Iran Heritage Foundation. The conference was attended by approximately 100 members of the general public, including many from Manchester's large expat Iranian community. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59150</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I000380/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>235118E8-E88E-48B8-AC83-F773D1C74EB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Middle East &amp; African Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
