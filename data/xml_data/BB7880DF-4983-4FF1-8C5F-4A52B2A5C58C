The BCQ measures parenting principles that guide care during infancy, and specific practices with respect to infant feeding, sleeping, and soothing. UK ?based BCQ data has revealed two factors or parenting principles, structure and attunement. Structure refers to reliance on routines and schedules, and attunement refers to reliance on infant cues.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will involve three studies to develop and evaluate the reliability and cross-cultural validity of the BCQ in the UK, Hong Kong, and mainland China.The resulting measure will be a valuable tool for addressing a wide range of theoretical and practical questions, including how parenting environments during infancy influence social and cognitive development, how changing socioeconomic and political conditions around the world are influencing families, and how risk factors surrounding birth, such as preterm birth, interact with individual and cultural factors, such as parenting principles and practices.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research is concerned with the principles that guide parenting during infancy, and how those principles influence, or are influenced by, decision-making about everyday caregiving practices such as breastfeeding and bedsharing. One premise of this project is that both cultural and individual factors lead to variation in parenting principles and practices. The primary purpose of this research is to develop a methodological tool for social and life scientists to use in future studies of parenting during infancy, but we also expect the results of this research and the results of subsequent studies resulting from this research to be of interest to practitioners and care providers in health and education who are concerned with infant health and well-being, family support, and the well-being of mothers and fathers. For example, medical practitioners, including midwives, health visitors, and doctors who provide care to infants and their families will be interested in the results of this project and of subsequent projects using this methodological tool because it will help them to understand the decision-making processes of parents, how to speak with families about those decisions, and how to promote the adoption of healthful practices such as breastfeeding. Similarly, social agencies and charities who provide support to families with the aim of promoting infant and maternal health as well as strong family bonds will be interested in this research and subsequent studies based on this research because of the insights it promises into the needs of both parents and infants, as well as parental decision-making and family environments. This will not only be true for UK-based agencies and charities, but also for international agencies and charities, especially those working with populations in Hong Kong or other parts of China. We also expect this research to be of interest to national and international policy-makers who aim to promote infant health and well-being, including healthful family practices. 

We will present our findings at international conferences such as the International Society for Infant Studies, and the Society for Research in Child Development, and at university seminars and workshops. We will publish written reports of our findings in international journals that are read by a broad range of scientists, including developmental psychologists, anthropologists, and medical researchers. We have several routes for impact beyond academic audiences, including talks to general audiences, talks to practitioner groups, and working with traditional media (print, radio and television) and internet-based media (e.g., blogs, science sites, and parenting sites). Dr Gattis' research group has a strong record of engagement activities, including public talks and other fora, as well as collaborations with artists to communicate scientific findings. Dr Gattis' group, Development@Cardiff, has a Research Advisory Board that meets annually to review and advise on research aims, activities, and impact. The Research Advisory Board includes health visitors and paediatricians, representatives from government agencies and charities, and academic advisors. This provides a formal mechanism for formulation and implementation of impact activities, and also provides important connections to specific routes for impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80492</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Santa Barbara</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Baby Care Questionnaire - Spanish</gtr:description><gtr:id>22109D59-9E56-4ED3-A99B-3796464A3805</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet.

Our first and primary achievement is that we have developed a Chinese version of a new measure of parenting during infancy, the Baby Care Questionnaire (BCQ-Chinese). The BCQ-Chinese was developed by a research team that included bilingual and bicultural individuals with expertise on parenting during infancy. The research team first evaluated the conceptual equivalence of two key parenting beliefs or principles: structure and attunement. The research team then evaluated and selected a subset of belief statements from the initial English version of the Baby Care Questionnaire (based on Winstanley &amp;amp; Gattis, 2013), and generated new statements for measuring structure and attunement. This process yielded two versions of the Baby Care Questionnaire, the BCQ-Chinese and a new version of the BCQ-English (Revised) to dovetail the Chinese version. Both versions of the BCQ were then evaluated through cognitive interviews conducted with parents in Hong Kong and Mainland China and in Cardiff. During the cognitive interviews, mothers of infants were asked to &amp;quot;think-aloud&amp;quot; as they read the questionnaire items and came up with responses. To make sure that the BCQ was understandable for people from diverse education backgrounds, we interviewed mothers with educational levels ranging from 8 years of formal education to university graduates in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the UK. This development process required considerable collaboration across the the research teams in Hong Kong, Lanzhou, and the UK. 

In order to establish the cross-cultural validity of the measure, we then evaluated the psychometric properties of the BCQ-Chinese and the English version of the BCQ (BCQ-English) with two large internet samples in China (N=979) and the UK (N=456). The results of this evaluation indicates that the two principles of parenting during infancy proposed by Winstanley and Gattis (2013), structure and attunement, can be considered in similar terms across Chinese and British cultures. In other words, our second achievement is that we have established measurement equivalence for the two key principles of parenting during infancy, structure and attunement. 

Our third achievement is an evaluation of the validity of the two principles of structure and attunement, or in other words, an investigation of whether parents' self-reports correspond to researcher ratings. To accomplish this, we conducted parent interviews in the homes of 40 infants in Hong Kong, 37 infants in Lanzhou, and 39 infants in Cardiff. We compared researcher ratings against parent self-report on the BCQ for the key principles of structure and attunement. Reliability across raters was good for both attunement (intraclass R(38) = .71, p &amp;lt; .001) and structure (intraclass R(38) = .88, p &amp;lt; .001). BCQ scores for the parenting principle of structure correlated significantly with researcher ratings for structure based on the parent interviews and observations, r(73) = .28, p &amp;lt;.02. In other words, we were able to establish the validity of parents' self-report of structure, as measured by the BCQ, against researcher ratings of structure, as measured from home-based observations and interviews. BCQ scores for the parenting principle of attunement, in contrast, did not correlation with researcher ratings of attunement from the home-based observations and interviews.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The BCQ-English and the BCQ-Chinese are a useful measurement tool for researchers and clinicians interested in evaluating the beliefs and behaviours of parents of infants. 

The BCQ is suitable for evaluating the beliefs of parents who are not currently engaged with parenting, for example expectant parents or parents who are not currently in custody of their child. 

The BCQ is also suitable for evaluating how parenting beliefs shape the everyday caregiving behaviours of parents caring for infants, including infant feeding, soothing, and sleeping.

Finally, the BCQ is an appropriate tool for investigating how parenting beliefs influence infant and child development. 

The BCQ-English has already been adopted by numerous North American researchers for research studies. The BCQ-Chinese has recently been implemented in a cohort study of child development based in Zhenjiang, China.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>416A8404-E84A-4B9B-96B6-DBD882E4A7F5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5453c5251efcd4.08509862</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training for Practitioners</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>477526B9-3C8D-4B5D-B729-74E30915AB6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Merideth Gattis conducted a training workshop for professional practitioners in the department of maternal and child health at the Zhenjiang People's Hospital Number 4 In April 2015.

The training equipped practitioners with greater knowledge about the importance of parenting during infancy, and the factors that influence parenting decisions such as whether to breastfeed their infants. The training also provided practitioners with tools to discuss parenting beliefs and practices when meeting with parents of infants as part of the routine well-baby care. Practitioners here in the UK may take these opportunities for granted, but practitioners in Zhenjiang indicated that this was the first opportunity they had had for such training. Practitioners reported that the training began a new process for them - that of considering how to base their decisions as practitioners in maternal and child health on empirical evidence, and to communicate with parents about these topics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16f19ddffd7.98723502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Baby Care Questionnaire - Chinese is a parent-report survey tool that identifies the principles and practices that parents employ in caring for their infants.
