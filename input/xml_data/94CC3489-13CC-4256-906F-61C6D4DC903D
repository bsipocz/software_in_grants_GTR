The new Industrial Strategy must consider how the education system can create the general and specific skills needed by businesses today and in the future. CEP will synthesise evidence on strengths and weaknesses in the current education system at all levels (schools, colleges and universities), and highlight where improvements can be made. This might be within the current system, or through the design of new mechanisms to incentivise individuals and firms to invest in training. In conjunction with researchers from the Centre for Vocational Education Research (CVER), we can produce a synthesis of findings on technical and vocational education. We will also be able to study in more depth firm-level relationships with higher education institutions, with the aim of better understanding how they impact on local economies.

2) Driving Growth across the Country: Mapping the Data on Firms and Labour Markets. 
The starting point for developing appropriate regionally focused growth policies is to understand the status quo, to carefully document how this has changed over time, and to better understand the factors underlying and driving geographic differences. The CEP is developing better data to describe the geographic spread of industry, and associated variation in labour market patterns like problems of real wage stagnation and the rise of new types of work arrangements, including the gig economy. As well as analysis of the digital economy, and the opportunities and threats it poses for the labour market and implications for the future. We will seek to release reports describing the data, map the relevant metrics (including productivity, investment, employment and pay) so that policymakers and stakeholders could benchmark their own regions/sectors. 

3) Supporting Businesses to Start and Grow: Drivers of Innovation and Diffusion. 
The Industrial Strategy should be focused on addressing market failures which cause barriers to investment in innovation, technologies or organisational practices that drive productivity growth. One strand of work using patents will analyse the innovation spillovers between technologies and places, and the types of policy that stimulate business R&amp;amp;D and innovation. The spillover analysis would also be linked with new measures of regional Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to understand the local economic impact of innovation. This work will help guide policymakers to where the payoffs of R&amp;amp;D investment might be greatest for the UK. In this context, we would consider payoffs both in terms of economic growth but also in terms of achieving non-economic objectives such as lower greenhouse gas emissions and more secure energy supply. We also plan to produce a report together with the LSE's Grantham Institute on clean growth. Another strand of work will consider the role of financial constraints on firm growth, and the extent to which these have contributed to recent poor productivity performance in the UK. And finally, we will explore the relationships between management practices and investment efficiency. 

4) Encouraging Trade and Inward Investment: Brexit and Industrial Strategy. 
Many UK firms (particularly SMEs) face longstanding barriers to exporting, and Brexit will create new challenges in this area. At the same time, while UK Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) performance has been stronger to date, there are concerns that Brexit will induce multinationals to relocate in order to maintain access to the single market. CEP will seek to understand the likely trade and FDI impacts of Brexit, and the implications for labour markets and consumers. This will include a deeper analysis of the sectoral and regional dimensions, and should be useful to inform the scope and form of industrial policy response.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Informing and Supporting the Industrial Strategy

The research findings and outputs from each of these four projects will be used to inform and support the Industrial Strategy through active dialogue and dissemination with policymakers, media, businesses and other stakeholders. The new funding will allow us to deliver policy oriented reports (for example under our CEP Special Paper series or as part of the follow-on work of the LSE Growth Commission) which will be academically robust and will subsequently go on to become peer reviewed journal papers.

Deliverable outputs from the four projects will be produced by April and July 2018, and we can share intermediate findings and work in progress where these would be considered useful. CEP researchers have already been working closely with BEIS, HM Treasury and the Downing Street Policy Unit on Industrial Strategy through a series of meetings, roundtables and seminar presentations and this will continue. The funding will allow us to provide both high-level briefings for ministers and senior civil servants, together with more detailed &amp;quot;teach-ins&amp;quot; with more junior policy advisers and researchers. We are keen that such interactions are two-way, and will seek to engage the policy community from the start (as with did with the recent LSE Growth Commission) to ensure that from initiation onwards the new work this funding will support is helpful to those designing and implementing the new Industrial Strategy.

The CEP would also organise events or workshops in order to discuss and share new work, and working with our impact team we would also seek to put together short-term multimedia outputs (blogs, videos) and articles for Centrepiece in order to disseminate our work to wider audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>500872</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/S000097/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>71E94BA5-333E-4F49-9ECA-60771CC7532E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
