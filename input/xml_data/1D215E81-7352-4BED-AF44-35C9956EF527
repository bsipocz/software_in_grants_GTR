Some of these systems are already capable of synchronising with a live database, or if required a plugin will be developed to allow the sharing of information. 

We are able to present this integrated information in a more user friendly platform using a Google Maps environment. This Asset information is editable using administration and end user interfaces. By developing a change control system, this will allow the stakeholder to be made aware of actions or alerts required to install and operate assets. 

Our key deliverables are to integrate with all commonly used software systems allowing Asset Mapping to be used as the interface to a single source of trusted information for all stages of an asset's lifecycle.

The possible savings gained from online collaboration have been outlined by many studies, including Stanford University; which state savings of between 35% and 65% of a workforces time is saved by removing the verifying and validating information before it is trusted. **

Work breakdown structure:
We will investigate the most commonly used software platforms in the life cycle of the systems used to operate and monitor cities and individual buildings. Working with expert advisors to define the enterprise platforms and live monitoring systems required for Asset Mapping to develop interoperability for a city wide platform.

We will employ a team of known PHP programmers, database designers and integration engineers to develop the above interoperability, testing as we go.

We will be working using a LAMP setup; Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP as this is the current foundation of the Asset Mapping platform.

Our development will incorporate Semantic relations of information produced by each stage of a buildings life cycle and its individual assets.

Our development will take into consideration the requirement for the automatic notification, alert management, with change control for the health and location of individual assets. 

We will also research the development of context awareness of devices including user profiles and the on board sensors. This will allow for a flexible dynamic interface and incorporate security profiles based on GEO fencing. We will also be able to route the user to the location of each asset should site attendance be required for perhaps installation or maintenance.
