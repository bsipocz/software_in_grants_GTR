We will undertake an in-depth assessment of patients and their care arrangements in a population recruited through networks in six European countries. The systems and procedures that are used in the provision of care will be reviewed through a systematic literature review, interviews and assessments of patients, carers and health care providers, and through a trial comparing assessment by a specialist with management suggestions, guidance and access to telephone advice to that of usual care.
Through interviews, questionnaire assessment and review of current health-care and social care arrangement, we will assess the needs, provision of care and use of health-care resources, and their impact on patient and carer outcomes in different countries. National and regional databases will also be interrogated to identify current practice and use of health-care resources and drug usage. A systematic literature review of the evidence for effective management strategies, analysis of the study data, and evaluation of change in outcomes following specialist review will provide the basis for recommendations in the management of late stage Parkinsonism. We will also evaluate potentially useful outcome measures for use in this patient group.
In addition to charting the needs and current care provision for late stage Parkinsonism in different European countries, its cost and effectiveness, and an analysis of health-care and social care predictors of improved outcome, the project will produce a platform for the assessment of patients with late stage Parkinsonism, their current treatment and care provision, as well as guidelines on the management of this late disease phase.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The information on current strategies and pathways for care provision and on interventions that are associated with better outcome in this study, both from the intervention part and the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, will provide important information to researchers planning studies on improved care provision. The results will also form the basis for an application for a full RCT of successful interventions of this group. As added value, there will be increased knowledge of different approaches to healthcare in different systems and of difficulties encountered by health and social care providers across European countries, which will supply social and economic studies in different health care systems.
The results may also provide a model for the research on better management of other chronic neurological disorders and age-related disorders in various health-care systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252403</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Parkinson's Disease Association (EPDA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the European Parkinson's Disease Association (EPDA) on their project &amp;quot;My Patient Journey&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>B6DC7A15-8305-4748-9D05-156CF7FFD98D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Engagement with multiple stakeholders, in particular through the EPDA, including national policy makers in several European countries, national Patient Associations, members of the European Parliament and the International Movement Disorders Society.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546df5745e58e2.80611152-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The &amp;quot;My PD Journey&amp;quot; project is initiated by the the EPDA, in collaboration with the Movement Disorders Society European Section, and funding has been provided by the EPDA and Abbvie Pharmaceuticals.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The aims of the EPDA project &amp;quot;My Patient Journey&amp;quot; overlap with those of our project, but utilise different methodology and aim at a slightly different target group (all patients with Parkinson's disease, primarily those in earlier disease stages). In order to maximise the information gained from both studies and to complement the research from both projects, AS have been acting as the scientific advisor to the EPDA project and facilitate information exchange. I have advised on the methodology and content of a European-wide survey in people with PD, carers and health care professionals, and presented the results to members of the European Parliament in Brussels.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As part of a collaboration linked to this award, a survey has been completed in more than 1,700 patients with Parkinson's disease and carers in 11 European countries. The first results of this survey have been submitted as an abstract to the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society annual conference. I have also spoken in the European Parliament on the impact of Parkinson's disease and service provision for patients with Parkinson's disease based on the results of this survey, and participated in public information events on this topic.
During the latest reporting period an abstract has been presented at the Movement Disorders Conference in Berlin and I have been a lead for the Parkinson's Disease UK Executive Network in London.</gtr:description><gtr:id>19297DD1-F853-49AE-9209-32CE78C957DA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc88bfbb4c04.16285230</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L009250/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
