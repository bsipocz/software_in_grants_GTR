The dicot strategy is for the growing tip of the plant to climb upward by producing an elongating stem below it. Leaf buds are also generated at the growing tip and eventually these grow out from the stem to form fully grown leaves. The monocot strategy is for the growing tip to stay protected at the base of the plant and produce a series of concentric leaves that rise above it. Leaf blades emerge and bend outwards at the top of the concentric cylinder or leaf bases. Only at later stages does the growing tip itself rise upwards through elongation of the stem to produce the flowering structures. This monocot strategy has the advantage of protecting the growing tip at the base of the plant for much of its life history. It enables grasses to survive extensive grazing and is the growth strategy that underlies cereals like wheat, maize and rice.

Despite its ecological and agronomic importance, the monocot strategy is much less well understood than the dicot strategy. In particular, it is unclear how monocot leaf buds grow to form concentric cylinders topped by outwardly bending blades. By using computational modelling we have developed some preliminary hypotheses for how this might work. A key idea is that growth is oriented by a polarity field; analogous to the way a magnetic field can be used to orient directions of navigation. The observed growth and shape changes of the monocot leaf can then be explained by simple changes in the polarity field and pattern of growth rates it orients. The main aim of this proposal is to test and further build upon this model to determine whether the fields and rates of growth it predicts are correct or not. This will be achieved using the maize monocot system which has the advantage of having well developed genetics and associated technologies. By looking at markers that highlight the presumed polarity fields and determining the growth rates in different regions of the leaf we hope to test predictions of the model. Models will also be tested by analysing the mutants in which key transitions of development are disrupted. These studies will be made quantitative by writing computer programs that extract the relevant measures automatically. New computational methods will also be developed and applied to this system so that the processes can be understood at different levels, from cellular to tissue scale.

This type of study, which integrates computational and experimental approaches, should provide a rigorous and quantitative understanding of the mysteries behind the monocot growth strategy. The understanding it generates may also allow us to further modulate the shape and disposition of leaves in crops. The angle at which the leaf blade bends out, for example, depends on growth at the blade junction, and has an important effect on yield because it influences the amount of light that can be harvested for photosynthesis. Knowing how this process works and is controlled by genes may therefore help breeders improve crop performance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Through a combination of experimental and modelling approaches we aim to produce a mechanistic model for how the key developmental transitions underlying the monocot strategy are generated and genetically controlled. Hypotheses for key developmental and shape transitions will be tested by visualising maize PIN auxin transporter proteins, which act both as markers for tissue cell polarity and as readouts for auxin-based polarity coordination mechanisms. Further tests will be carried out by following the expression of genes known to affect PIN1 polarity and key developmental switches in maize. We will also introduce Cre-Lox reporters to enable induction and visualisation of clonal markers at various stages, allowing hypotheses about growth patterns to be tested. Both Confocal and Optical Projection Tomography imaging will be used to obtain information from the cellular to whole organ scales. We will apply the above methods to wild type and mutants which affect key transitions and determine whether the results confirm or refute particular hypotheses. We will also use the Cre-Lox system to generate timed clonal sectors for genes such as KN1 and analyse their consequences on polarity and growth. In parallel, computational methods will be developed to extract salient features and parameters from images generated by immunolocalisation, GFP markers, clonal analysis and live tissue tracking. The results will provide quantitative measures for hypothesis testing. In conjunction with the experiments described above, hypotheses for key developmental transitions will be further formulated and modified using the GPT computational framework, which allows tissues to be modelled as 2D sheets that deform in 3D. This framework will also be elaborated to allow cellular level models for polarity coordination to be explored, and models for the formation of volumetric 3D outgrowths, such as ligules, to be incorporated.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit non-academic beneficiaries, in the following ways: 

1. Breeders will benefit from knowledge that will facilitate the selection of candidate genes for improving crop growth and yield by conventional or transgenic approaches. The expected time frame for this beneficial impact will be 10 years after the start of the project.

2. Biotech industries will benefit from our work in the long term, through the greater fundamental understanding of processes that underlie tissue properties in plants and animals. This may open up new avenues to exploit and manipulate growing tissues. They will also benefit from the tools developed in the project such as integrating computational methods with bioimaging approaches that may become applicable to their research and development programmes. The time frame for this type of impact is expected to be 10-20 years. 
 
3. The general public and school children will benefit directly from this project through the proposed hands-on training events and through dissemination of latest research findings in an accessible way via media routes like youtube videos and press articles. They will also benefit in the longer term because of the contribution that this project will make to maintaining and developing forward-looking scientific research that provides the foundations of a modern healthy and growing economy.

4. BBSRC will benefit because the project is directly relevant to the research priority Systems Biology and the general area of food security. It will also benefit from the integration of expertise in developmental genetics of monocots from a leading lab in the USA, with computational modelling and image analysis in the UK, enhanced by leverage of funds from NSF.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>923379</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Berkeley</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Maize leaf development</gtr:description><gtr:id>57E45EB4-DA0D-496D-8B4C-E6F2DE51F78A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were awarded an NSF/BBSRC grant</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9bf13ae8481.71139324-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner is carrying out molecular genetic analysis in maize</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We contribute computational modelling of development</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bringing the 'Self-made Shape' exhibit to 'Science Uncovered 2016' at the Natural history museum</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27DCF403-CF3B-4681-86E1-FFCFA1FB260E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An exhibition stand called 'Self-made shape', which communicated research findings on how form and pattern develop in different plants, was created.

Both appear altered in the barley (Hordeum vulgare) Hooded mutant, in which ectopic expression of the KNOTTED1-like Homeobox (KNOX) gene, BKn3, causes inverted polarity of differentiated hairs and ectopic flowers, in addition to wing-shaped outgrowths. These lemma-specific effects allow the spatiotemporal analysis of events following ectopic BKn3 expression, determining the relationship between KNOXs, polarity, and shape. We show that tissue cell polarity, based on localization of the auxin transporter SISTER OF PINFORMED1 (SoPIN1), dynamically reorients as ectopic BKn3 expression increases. Concurrently, ectopic expression of the auxin importer LIKE AUX1 andboundary gene NO APICAL MERISTEM is activated. The polarity of hairs reflects SoPIN1 patterns, suggesting that tissue cell
polarity underpins oriented cell differentiation. Wing cell files reveal an anisotropic growth pattern, and computational
modeling shows how polarity guiding growth can account for this pattern and wing emergence. The inverted ectopic flower
orientation does not correlate with SoPIN1, suggesting that this form of regional polarity is not controlled by tissue cell
polarity. Overall, the results suggest that KNOXs trigger different morphogenetic effects through interplay between tissue cell
polarity, identity, and growth.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to be used at this stage.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5A16A533-F4D9-4DB7-B1C8-DEC1C596D809</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9ad3b22ee41.63197024</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BDDB363A-5CFA-4A68-B195-876A543F4FED</gtr:id><gtr:title>Growth and Development of Three-Dimensional Plant&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Form.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current biology : CB</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0e3f60475403264f37364e01caffe1d8"><gtr:id>0e3f60475403264f37364e01caffe1d8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whitewoods CD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-9822</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a85687ea91d98.13929202</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>065E4033-0DF4-44DB-82C4-7A81927DC152</gtr:id><gtr:title>Resolving Conflicts: Modeling Genetic Control of Plant Morphogenesis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d4635363f12b92ec2b032066de604f76"><gtr:id>d4635363f12b92ec2b032066de604f76</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coen E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1534-5807</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a4652c7c7db7.39139911</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A1D7AA9F-0069-49F6-B971-B0EC50099183</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ectopic KNOX Expression Affects Plant Development by Altering Tissue Cell Polarity and Identity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Plant cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4b26f1268fde1dba4cd7f60aca877b82"><gtr:id>4b26f1268fde1dba4cd7f60aca877b82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richardson AE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1040-4651</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d3ba407a883.05273265</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>25AC20E6-C767-4322-B0D1-039B1E802928</gtr:id><gtr:title>Macro optical projection tomography for large scale 3D imaging of plant structures and gene activity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental botany</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8ae8898ea973d470393f7ae6624b4035"><gtr:id>8ae8898ea973d470393f7ae6624b4035</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee KJI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-0957</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a47b68824676.99428519</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C8E32E6A-DE95-4816-9394-DCF4811780C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>On genes and form.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Development (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d4635363f12b92ec2b032066de604f76"><gtr:id>d4635363f12b92ec2b032066de604f76</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coen E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-1991</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a85687dda8645.17296600</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BA159542-E21E-4837-8988-6AA05776AC36</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fruit shape diversity in the Brassicaceae is generated by varying patterns of anisotropy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Development (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/54fcae4ebeb64d17c9c2bf41e4e39c8c"><gtr:id>54fcae4ebeb64d17c9c2bf41e4e39c8c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eldridge T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-1991</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a4652c59b6a2.08952014</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M023117/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp;
