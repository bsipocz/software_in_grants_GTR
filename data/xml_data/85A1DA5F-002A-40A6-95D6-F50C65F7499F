Transition issues are becoming prominent in accounting and finance research and are highly relevant for corporate market participants, standard setters and financial analysts. This harmonisation process is designed to enhance the comparability of financial statements across countries, minimise the costs of account preparation under different regimes, facilitate company valuation, and clarify the underlying economics of the firm. &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>Significant risks underlie the introduction and implementation of the new rules related to their applicability in different environments and to the technical challenges presented. For example, while investors familiarise with new methods of corporate reporting, analysts' support will be limited due to the difficulty in forecasting IFRSs figures and the lack of sell-side analysts using an IFRS basis for forecasts. The risk of inefficiencies and market mis-pricing will increase if the new rules provide additional scope for managing reported earnings and book value.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The series will consist of one conference and two one-day workshops each year for two years, and will promote the research dissemination and peer networking activities of young and emerging researchers. Its interdisciplinary theme will be of interest to researchers in auditing, accounting, market-based accounting research, financial management, finance and international business.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15605</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series was exceptionally successful. The research presented was of a very high standard and much of it has appeared in the leading international academic journals in accounting and related areas. The series has fostered further institutional reesrach collaboration between some leading accounting and finance departments. Indeed, the series has continued to run annually under the co-sponsorship of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales [ICAEW], CAIR at MBS, and the London School of Economics. The eigth conference in the series was held at the LSE in September 2014, organised by the accounting subject area group at LSE.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AED68AFF-B1AE-4B12-AFB9-C032AF2AFC0B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460c61e3fe425.72340700</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main aims and objectives of the seminar series were:
o to enhance development of the growing research area analysing the impact of IFRS by providing a forum to host presentations of relevant new research which has the potential to be internationally significant.
o to highlight the research contribution of &amp;quot;young and emerging researchers&amp;quot; in this interdisciplinary areas of accounting, market-based accounting research, financial management and international business. 
o to provide a forum for networking and research dissemination opportunities among their peer group for individuals who are near the beginning of their academic and research careers
o to facilitate peer group interaction and the free exchange of ideas, focusing on the provision of constructive feedback from peer group members and more senior members of the academic community</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The seminar series was the first to address the research questions posed by the transition to IFRS, and attracted participation from leading global academics (Universities of Cambridge, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Chicago) and Board members of the leading global accounting bodies, including IASB and FASB.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>873F8148-D227-4BB4-B318-2FDCFDBBA98E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c88c9ed175.98308831</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://research.mbs.ac.uk/investment-risk/Events.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-451-25-4253</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-451-25-4253</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
