We aim to encourage a public perception of Nottingham as the most curious city in England. 
By working in schools and local communities our aim is that young people will shift perceptions that science is relevant to their lives and that Space Science in particular is a topic of cultural interest.
Our anecdotal evidence from many years of public engagement projects, and especially among disadvantaged communities, is that young people and their families are hesitant and inhibited in engaging with science by a perception that the subject is hard, mostly conducted in remote locations like universities, and is 'not for the likes of them'. (Separately, the Nottingham STEMCity Partnership are considering commissioning a public attitudes survey.) Such inhibitions translate as a disinclination to even ask questions of scientific significance; there is, therefore, a cultural imperative to support curiosity. Lab_13 aims to foster an ethos of curiosity and inquiry prompted by users' questions rather than the demands of the science syllabus.

2 Growing Partnerships and Links across Education Institutions and Improving Attainment - To build better links between research and the classroom, and to inspire more children and young people to take up further STEM study and careers. By combining curiosity, creativity and science, and working particularly at primary level we aim to create memorable and inspiring experiences through Lab_13 that will remain with young people and their families into their adult lives. 
The links we wish to develop through this programme include promotion of the Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS) in secondary schools in Nottingham North (there is currently only one registered IRIS school in the city). The Lab_13 Network in Nottingham North will thus complement IRIS in secondary schools; our objectives linked to this aim include developing shared projects of investigation across the year groups; and combined presentations at meetings and symposia, notably at the Festival of Science and Curiosity.

3 Growing the Lab_13 Network - To establish and strengthen links between Lab_13s, in Nottingham, across the UK network and overseas. Lab_13 started in Nottingham in 2008, and now has three in the city, including Lab_13 Rosehill for children with autism (supported by STFC grant ST/P001548/1). Lab_13s also operate in London, Wellingborough and overseas in Ghana and Finland. With support from an RSA catalyst award, and a bequest from the estate of our former Chair, we are planning to open Lab_13s in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa and in India. 
This programme in Nottingham North aims to establish close working relationships across the different student management committees and their secondary school counterparts, to involve members of families and the wider communities in investigations that truly reflect the best principles of Citizen Science, and to celebrate findings and outcomes at the Nottingham Festival of Science and Curiosity.
From this sound and comprehensive network in Nottingham, further exchanges of investigations and eventually Scientists in Residence, children and teachers, will be promoted, both online and in person.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We intend to devise a communications plan for this programme led by Ignite!'s Communication Executive, Megan Shore. Megan already leads on communications across a number of platforms, notably the Ignite Futures website and blog:
https://www.ignitefutures.org.uk/
and
https://www.ignitefutures.org.uk/blog

Our Facebook pages and twitter feeds are here:

Lab_13s use a wordpress account to post their news and experiments:
https://lab13network.wordpress.com/

As the Lab_13 International network grows we are raising funds to create a web platform that is more interactive and can support children from Lab_13 committees in more sharing of experiences, investigations and experiments. We anticipate that this new platform will be created during the lifetime of this programme, (partial funds have been raised from the RSA and the bequest from our former Chair). We also intend to create the Lab_13 Cookbook over the course of the next 18 months- 2 years; a Compendium of Curiosity, this will document experiments and investigations by children and young people from Lab_13. We have secured a voluntary commitment of five days from a friend of the programme to start the formatting of such a resource.

Key to the dissemination of resources, outputs and outcomes from the programme is the Nottingham Festival of Science and Curiosity and the associated media coverage that we expect to generate. There will be specific sharing events at both the 2018 and 2019 festivals.

At local and city wide level, a number of events will be scheduled throughout the programme, including Lab_13 Lectures, open evenings, Family Fun Days and Science Fairs. In October 2019, the network will be encouraged to participate in Fun Palaces weekend and the Nottingham Science Fair at the City Council offices. 

Other networks - Rick Hall, Ignite! and the Festival of Science and Curiosity are members of:
RSA Fellowship and Creative Education Group
Winston Churchill Trust Fellowship Education Group
British Interactive Group (BIG)
PSCI-COMM 
UK Science Festivals Network
Education Working Group of European Citizen Science Association
ASDC
WISE and ASE

We will take as many opportunities as possible to attend conferences of these networks (and especially where we can include and accompany children, teachers and scientists in residence).

In September 2017 Rick Hall attended the STFC/IoP Interact symposium and presented interim findings from the current STFC programme at Lab_13 Rosehill. We look forward to attending the next Interact event with hopefully an update from the programme of this application.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R005893/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
