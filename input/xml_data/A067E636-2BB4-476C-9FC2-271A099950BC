These processes are important when white blood cells monitor the body for presence of disease-causing pathogens, as well as during the immune response when white blood cells destroy or neutralize pathogens. Without attachment and movement, cells cannot be in the right place at the right time to mount an immune response to a pathogen. We are trying to understand the molecular basis of white blood cell attachment and movement. We focus on a family of cell adhesion proteins called integrins. We are interested in finding out how the integrins become activated to achieve cell binding and movement. In particular, we are interested in the role of a group of proteins called 14-3-3 proteins in these processes. 14-3-3 proteins bind to the 'tails' of the integrins inside the cell, as well as to many other proteins in activated immune cells. We now aim to understand if these interactions are important for the regulation of immune cell adhesion and movement. We will use transgenic technology as well as novel biochemical methods for these studies. The results will increase our understanding of how immune cells move and attach to other cells during an immune response.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The main objective for this proposal is to investigate the role of 14-3-3 proteins in regulating T cell adhesion and migration mediated by integrins and changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. These processes are important for T cell recirculation, recruitment into inflamed tissue, T cell activation and effector functions. 14-3-3 proteins bind to serine/threonine phosphorylated sequences in proteins, including many proteins involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics. We have shown that Thr-phosphorylation of the LFA-1 integrin leads to 14-3-3 recruitment in T cell receptor-activated T cells. This interaction regulates actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and adhesion in vitro. We have also shown that 14-3-3s bind many other proteins in activated T cells. Thus, 14-3-3s can be used as a 'phospho-fingerprinting device' to investigate cell signaling. We now aim to investigate the role of the 14-3-3-integrin complex in vivo, as well as search for novel 14-3-3 interactors in primary human T cells. Aim 1. Investigate the role of the 14-3-3-binding site of LFA-1 (beta2-integrin Thr758-760) in T cell adhesion and migration in vivo. We will produce a transgenic mouse model with a triple Thr758-760-beta2-integrin mutation and study T cell functions ex vivo and in vivo, including adhesion, migration, trafficking of cells in vivo and T cell effector functions. Aim 2. Identify novel 14-3-3 binding partners and phosphopeptides interacting with 14-3-3 proteins in resting, primary human T cells, as well as in T cells activated through the T cell receptor. We will isolate human T cells from buffy coats and use 14-3-3 affinity pulldowns and quantitative proteomics techniques to identify 14-3-3 binding partners and novel phosphorylation sites in resting and activated T cells. Investigations of the regulation of integrins and cell motility are fundamental for our understanding of T cell biology and for enhancing our knowledge about immune system regulation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>377074</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This is basic research which helps explain the roles and regulation of these molecules in immune responses.

These molecules are essential for the function of the white blood cell in the immune defence against pathogens, and mutations in integrins or associated proteins results in immunodeficiency. However, these molecules can also be associated with disease, such as autoimmunity. 



We have investigated cellular signalling mechanisms and cytoplasmic binding partners which regulate the activity of the integrins so that they can bind to other cells.



We have found that so called &amp;quot;killer T cells&amp;quot; which are involved in killing of for example virus-infected cells or cancer cells, use different mechanisms for cell trafficking into tissue than resting lymphocytes, in that their integrins are always active and able to bind to ligands. We have clarified some of the intracellular signals required for integrin-mediated killer T cell adhesion under conditions of blood flow, and have shown that intracellular calcium signals are important for integrin-mediated adhesion in these cells. 



Additionally, we have found that a protein called kindlin-3, which binds to the integrin, is critical for migration of immune cells (both resting lymphocytes and killer T cells) out of blood vessels into tissues, because it enables these cells to resist shear flow. However, the integrin/kindlin interaction is surprisingly not important for immune cell activation in tissues, where there is no blood flow. Interestingly, kindlin-3 is mutated in a rare human genetic disease called leukocyte adhesion deficiency type III, which is associated with increased bacterial infections; our results help explain what goes wrong in the immune system in these patients. 

Interestingly, the beta2-integrin family members are also highly expressed in another type of immune cell, the dendritic cell, that is very important in immune responses. Dendritic cells pick up antigens in inflamed tissues and move to lymph nodes where they present the antigen to T cells and activate them to help fight infection. We have recently discovered that one of the first steps in this activation chain is taken when the integrins lose their grip of their ligands in tissues and the actin cytoskeleton inside the dendritic cells. This leads to increased signaling through another cell surface receptor, the GM-CSF receptor, in dendritic cells. The increased signaling results in reprogramming of the dendritic cells to a mature, migratory phenotype and induces them to migrate to lymph nodes to activate T cells. These results show that integrins play completely novel role in immune cell regulation, which have not previously been appreciated.

We have also investigated a systemic lupus erythematosus-associated mutation in an integrin, and have found that it is unable to bind to ligands and mediate phagocytosis (&amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; of target cells). This result may help explain why this mutation is associated with disease, as it is thought that lupus may be a defect in clearing of cellular waste through phagocytosis. 



Our results clarify molecular mechanisms involved in integrin regulation and clarify the roles of integrins in immune cell functions. Additionally, they also help us understand why certain mutations in these adhesion molecules or associated proteins are associated with disease.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope that basic research such as this could be used in the future to develop more specific drugs to autoimmune and inflammatory disease.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AB367F56-7CF7-4E4F-A819-CCC12D98C4B7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2988097251.3818154776ff92a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F50D7364-AED9-4BB1-AADD-29AC93A75888</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein kinase D isoforms are dispensable for integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion and homing to lymphoid tissues.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/45ae73dd14fc78edbb3df55e4d1e0223"><gtr:id>45ae73dd14fc78edbb3df55e4d1e0223</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Matthews SA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-2980</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_5435af15af1930f47</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CCFC9A40-0D35-4E8F-8695-16B35B5CE279</gtr:id><gtr:title>A systemic lupus erythematosus-associated R77H substitution in the CD11b chain of the Mac-1 integrin compromises leukocyte adhesion and phagocytosis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4635c0e205db8163635cf4b0427188b2"><gtr:id>4635c0e205db8163635cf4b0427188b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacPherson M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03a03ac71a1e1</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4829189A-77EE-4595-BAAC-7F31E7E74E35</gtr:id><gtr:title>Loss of beta2-integrin-mediated cytoskeletal linkage reprogrammes dendritic cells to a mature migratory phenotype.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72e97b073f9271756c0f754d7a54c5ca"><gtr:id>72e97b073f9271756c0f754d7a54c5ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morrison VL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2041-1723</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54589c0869b944.16853277</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>818D8019-0F24-4028-A779-F18253BF5D73</gtr:id><gtr:title>The ?2 integrin-kindlin-3 interaction is essential for T-cell homing but dispensable for T-cell activation in vivo.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Blood</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72e97b073f9271756c0f754d7a54c5ca"><gtr:id>72e97b073f9271756c0f754d7a54c5ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morrison VL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-4971</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_5435af15af1abe28a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>57E900C9-4E5B-402B-B411-3C39D55E38DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>The CD11b-integrin (ITGAM) and systemic lupus erythematosus.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Lupus</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/49f8fa7bc125e21a843aafc56fd19b47"><gtr:id>49f8fa7bc125e21a843aafc56fd19b47</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fagerholm SC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0961-2033</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc043c0435bbf4b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A2CB7B82-AC51-41A9-92EE-EA21CD0DD51D</gtr:id><gtr:title>A crucial role for ?2 integrins in podosome formation, dynamics and Toll-like-receptor-signaled disassembly in dendritic cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of cell science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c0c942b776475ae17f78f4b8324b75f2"><gtr:id>c0c942b776475ae17f78f4b8324b75f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gawden-Bone C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9533</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54589cd86d2e00.32257475</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G017123/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
