For example, in the UK air pollution is estimated to reduce life expectancy by 6 months, with corresponding health costs of up to &amp;pound;19 billion each year. Successive UK governments have acted to mediate against the harmful effects of air pollution, by introducing legislation (e.g. UK Air Quality Strategy, 2007), and setting up the Committee On the Medical Effects of Air Pollution. Numerous epidemiological studies have been conducted to assess the health impact of air pollution over the last 30 years, most of which have focused on the effects of a few days of high concentrations. Much less research has focused on the effects of long-term exposure, which can be assessed by comparing the levels of pollution and ill health in populations living in small geographical regions, such as electoral wards, over a number of years.

However, conducting such a study is a complex task, and it is important that epidemiologists have access to appropriate statistical methods to accurately quantify the health impact of pollution. In particular, numerous factors will affect the pattern in ill health over space and time, including pollution levels and socio-economic factors. However, some of the latter will be unknown or unmeasured, and their existence will induce spatio-temporal correlation into the health data. This correlation is likely to be localised in space, as the similarity of the levels of ill health in geographically adjacent areas will depend on the similarity between the populations living in those areas. To not account for these unknown factors will risk biasing the estimated pollution-health relationship, and thus one of the key challenges of this project is to develop a statistical approach to address this issue. The other key challenge will be to accurately estimate the levels of individual air pollutants for ach local population and year. This is difficult, because the spatio-temporal pattern in pollution is often driven by atmospheric processes, which themselves are influenced by meteorological processes. A further complication is that, often, these processes have non-linear effects on each other, which excludes the use of linear interpolation methods often adopted in practice. The effects of multiple pollutants and overall air quality on health are also poorly understood, as quantifying these requires multivariate pollution models which are hard to fit and analyse. This project will use state-of-the-art meteorological, climate and air quality models developed by the Met Office to produce reliable air pollution estimates.

The main aim of this project is to create and test a single integrated model for health and pollution data that addresses these issues, thus allowing the effects of overall air pollution on health to be estimated. A secondary aim is to quantity the impact (bias) that ignoring these issues has on the estimated pollution-health relationship. The health model will need to provide an accurate representation of the localised spatio-temporal correlation in small-area health data, while the pollution model will need to provide estimates and measures of uncertainty for individual pollutants and overall air quality at any spatial and temporal resolution, as required to align with the health data. Importantly, the use of a formal statistical framework allows us to make a further innovation: namely, to measure the effect of climate change on health and air pollution. This will be achieved by using output from deterministic climate models to project air pollution levels under future climate conditions, and using those projected levels in the integrated health and pollution model. Overall, this proposal outlines the most detailed linkage of health and air pollution data yet attempted, by developing and testing a set of novel statistical models.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>269754</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contributed conference presentation at the GEOMED meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0FAAA1E3-0974-427D-B89F-EB1726153076</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 60 people attended this contributed conference talk by Alastair Rushworth

The workshop was held on 12th September 2014, and was supported by the Environmental Statistics section and the Glasgow local group of the Royal Statistical Society. The workshop attracted an audience of around 65 participants from across industry, government and academia, and had stimulating debate throughout. 

The first half of the workshop contained talks about the project and its progress.
The first was from Rachel McInnes from the UK Met Office, who discussed the Met Office air quality model and the use of it to predict air quality in the future. The second talk was from Sujit Sahu from the University of Southampton, who discussed how pollution concentrations could be predicted by using spatio-temporal statistical methodology and fusing monitoring and modelled pollution data. The final talk in the first half was from Duncan Lee from the University of Glasgow, who discussed the statistical problems encountered when estimating the health effects of air pollution and how those problems could be overcome. 


 The second half of the workshop contained speakers with a range of air pollution and health interests, including Stefan Reis, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Stefan spoke about the integration of modelled and personal monitoring pollution data. The second talk was given jointly by Iain Beverland and Jonathan Gillespie from the University of Strathclyde, focusing on the cohort studies and land-use regression models to estimate air pollution exposure. The final talk was given by Colin Ramsay from Health Protection Scotland, who discussed the epidemiological issues and work on estimating the health impact of air pollution.


The workshop engaged policymakers from Scotland in various government departments about the project, and has resulted in stronger ties between people working on air quality and health in Scotland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5449ecc450d773.90678822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop in Southampton</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4365C15A-86E6-4B7B-A990-69B47753BEA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop resulted in a lot of discussion about air pollution and its estimated health impacts.

The workshop was held on 15th April 2013, and was supported by the Environmental Statistics Section of the Royal Statistical Society. The workshop attracted an audience of around 30 participants. The talks in the morning were from academics working in this area, and the first of these was given jointly by Dr Sahu and Dr Lee who introduced the goals of the project. The rest of the morning saw talks from Dr Catheryn Tonne about the health impact of traffic related air pollution, and Prof Alan Gelfand about the consequences of spatial modeling of such data The afternoon was dedicated to non-academic industry partners, and the talks were given by Dr Brian Miller (Institute of Occupational Medicine and on the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution) on health impact assessment, Dr Stuart Sneddon (Ricardo-AEA) on air quality monitoring, and Dr Paul Agnew (Met Office) on air quality modeling.

1) The development of the statistical methodology in the project and its subsequent publication and presentation has alerted researchers to the biases that can arise from using simple and naive statistical models to estimate the effects of air pollution on health, and thus the need to use more advanced methodology. This need has been met by the development of the CARBayesST software to allow others to implement the methods used, and other researchers are now using this software for modelling their data.

2) The project organised and ran 3 workshops for policymakers and academics interested in air pollution and its health effects. These workshops were attended by participants from interested stakeholders such as the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, Health Protection Scotland, Transport Scotland, Public Health England and Ricardo-AEA. Around 70 delegates attended the workshop in Glasgow, and it helped form new links between researchers in Scotland. One aspect of these new links is the new alliance, the Scottish Research Partnership for Air Pollution health effects (SHAPE, http://www.shape.scot), which I am a member of. This group provides a regular forum for discussing issues in this sphere and holding workshops to bring all stakeholders together.

3) We have published a series of areal unit studies (small and large areas) investigating the impact of air pollution on human health in the UK (London, Glasgow, England and Scotland), and have found repeated evidence of associations across nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. These studies thus add to the evidence base about the pollution-health relationship in the UK, and can be used by bodies such as the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP) to inform future policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>47699105-CA07-4D46-8EB3-772C2C2BE3ED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5449f2362d62d5.18527522</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has developed novel statistical methodology for producing less biased estimates of the effects of air pollution on health using spatio-temporal areal unit data, and has provided freely available software for others to use to estimate these effects for their own data. Additionally, a number of UK based studies have been undertaken to quantify the health effects of different pollutants at different spatial scales in the UK, including Glasgow, London and the whole of England and Scotland. The key findings of the project are that:

1) The use of simple (naive) statistical models for estimating the long-term health effects of air pollution can result in biased estimates. Specifically, models that ignore or incorrectly represent the spatial structure in the disease data can result in biased estimates, as can models that ignore the inherent uncertainty in area averaged pollution concentrations. However as the estimated effect sizes are small, then ignoring the within area variation in pollution concentrations (known as ecological bias) does not in general lead to biased results. 

2) The use of rigorous statistical models that account for the statistical issues highlighted above can remove these biases, leading to better estimation of the health effects of air pollution.

3) New software called CARBayesST has been developed for the statistical software R, which can fit the models developed in the project to allow others to estimate the effects of air pollution on human health for their own data. The software is freely available for all to use, and contains a vignette with a worked example, making it easy to use.

4) Air pollution remains a substantial problem in the UK, with all studies that have been conducted exhibiting a substantial relationship between pollution and respiratory health. These relationships have been observed using small area data for London, Glasgow and the whole of Scotland, while similar sized relationships have been observed for the whole of England in larger area studies. In the large area studies in England it was nitrogen dioxide that was estimated to have the greatest health impact, while for the small area studies both nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter exhibited consistent and substantial health effects. However, in all cases the health effects are relative small, in common with the rest of the literature, making their estimation slightly inconsistent between studies as to which pollutant has the strongest effect. However, the population at risk is large (everybody), hence the magnitude of the public health burden of air pollution is large.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) Researchers or policymakers interested in estimating the effects of air pollution on health can use our results and available software (CARBayesST) to better estimate the effects of air pollution on health for their own data.
