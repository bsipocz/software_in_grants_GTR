But since this must be achieved using the same basic constituents - protons, neutrons, electrons - as &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; matter, the novelty must come from how they are combined, and the ways that the parts interact with each other, to give a different whole. Even when their constituents are simple, complex systems with many strongly interacting parts are difficult to understand theoretically. Progress in condensed matter physics therefore relies on the development of new theoretical strategies for understanding the emergence of large-scale behaviour in complex systems, as well as new computational techniques to simulate them.

It has recently been appreciated that a promising place to look for materials with novel properties is in so-called &amp;quot;frustrated magnets&amp;quot;, systems that are prevented, or at least hindered, from forming the usual magnetic states with which we are familiar. In physics, frustration refers to the presence of competing interactions that cannot simultaneously be satisfied, and occurs in certain materials containing localized magnetic moments, or spins.

Examples of particular recent interest are the &amp;quot;spin ices&amp;quot;, a family of compounds containing either dysprosium or holmium. These elements are highly magnetic, and are used for example in computer hard drives. The particular atomic arrangement in the spin ice compounds frustrates this magnetic tendency, leading to disordered systems where the individual moments fluctuate rather than forming an ordered structure. Among their many interesting properties, the spin ices are believed to host particles that behave as magnetic monopoles, long conjectured to exist as fundamental particles, but never observed. Both experimental and theoretical work is needed to understand the properties of these materials, to predict and discover new phenomena that they may host, and to extend this to other related systems.

This project will explore the properties of frustrated systems, including frustrated magnets such as spin ice, by developing new theoretical and computational techniques. In particular, they will be studied through phase transitions, sudden and dramatic differences in behaviour that occur as temperature (or another physical parameter) changes, such as the transition from liquid water to steam. Phase transitions can occur in frustrated magnets in the presence, for example, of externally applied magnetic fields, and can provide a unifying perspective on a number of frustrated systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is primarily motivated by scientific curiosity. While the research outcomes will doubtless lead to economic and societal benefits, these are expected to be realized on a timescale much longer than the project duration, and are consequently impossible to predict.

This research proposal would provide funding for a postdoctoral research assistant (PDRA). The work will provide training in advanced classical and quantum statistical mechanics, using tools such as mean-field techniques, effective field theory, and group theory. In addition, it is intended for the PDRA to perform numerical simulations to study these systems, providing training and experience in modern computational physics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92379</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>788CA7F5-7976-4610-94A6-B5FA65198F07</gtr:id><gtr:title>Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in quantum dimer models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/84ce5fc76754eebd4fbfcd8689327234"><gtr:id>84ce5fc76754eebd4fbfcd8689327234</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lan Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe886069b50.14439762</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2BBF6066-9233-4C3D-80E8-472129F7711A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mean-field theory for confinement transitions and magnetization plateaux in spin ice</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7fe555c511a3c13310a48e76c556b882"><gtr:id>7fe555c511a3c13310a48e76c556b882</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Powell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c684c1d02060.38530230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A0B34C2E-458F-4013-A78E-A73B877995EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Emergence of cooperative dynamics in fully packed classical dimers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review.
