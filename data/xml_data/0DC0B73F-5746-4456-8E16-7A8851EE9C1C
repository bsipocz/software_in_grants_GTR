It is therefore of great importance to develop methods for the mathematical analysis of the behaviour of the entire sequence, using the knowledge on the behaviour of one of the components and on the dependence between the components.

My main focus will be on stability, performance and optimality of such sequences of random variables, arising from various systems of applied interest. Stability may be loosely defined as the ability of a system to work in a well-controlled and well-predictable manner. Stability ensures a guaranteed quality of service to the customer and the use of resources below maximum capacity to the server. The question of stability is therefore a very important one and arguably the first question one needs to ask when studying a stochastic system. Once stability is established, one may ask various questions of performance and optimality and compare different governing algorithms (policies, strategies) with respect to different performance metrics.

My research will lead to the creation of new advanced probability methods and hence will be a step forward in the area of stochastic modelling. It will also be beneficial in a number of application areas: wireless communication networks, economics, energy and potentially others. 

In wireless communication networks my results will shed light on the stability and throughputs achieved by some known transmission protocols and also on delays experienced by individual transmissions. I will also work on constructing new algorithms, achieving better performance (in terms of stability, throughput or delays) in specific networks of practical interest. I plan to construct decentralised (not requiring a presence of a central controlling entity) algorithms achieving the best possible stability characteristics. In economics, my results will be interesting from a theoretical point of view and will lead to a better understanding of the behaviour of numerous economic models. In energy I will investigate different storage strategies and find optimal ones with respect to a performance metric of interest (for example minimising the cost or minimising probability of a shortage).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will have impact in the fields of communication technology and energy storage.

It will benefit the wireless-networks designers as it will shed light on the properties (stability, throughput, delays) of known algorithms. The research will also result in the design of new protocols (of special importance are decentralised ones), the knowledge of their properties and potential uses and will ultimately help to choose which protocols are best for a given network structure. The research also has a potential to provide tools for optimising the network-structure design. The potential beneficiaries are all major wireless-communications service providers and mobile-network operators and their Research and Development departments. Bell Labs, Deutsche Telekom, Philips Research, Microsoft Research will be interested in the results of the research.

In energy the research will lead to a better understanding of strategies to manage energy storage. This will help designing such storages which will be beneficial to the energy-systems regulatory bodies and potentially the public sector.

The proposed research will also have academic impact outside of mathematics as it will have direct applications in theoretical economics. The research will lead to a deeper understanding of the behaviour of numerous important economic models and of how this behaviour changes when more complex driving mechanisms are in place.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100240</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have investigated mathematical objects that describe the behaviour of various processes of interest in applications. I have developed methods for showing that (some parts of) these process are stable, in the sense that they behave in a predictable manner.
Using these techniques, my co-authors and I investigated properties of known wireless communication algorithms and improved the understanding of the throughputs they achieve in different scenarios.
Together with my co-authors, I have also developed a new algorithm for wireless communications which uses different frequencies and has a number of desirable properties.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- my results will have theoretical impact, as they may be used by other researchers in both applied probability and communication networks;
