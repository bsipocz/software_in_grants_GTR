Say, 70% stylish.&amp;quot;

This project aims to develop new techniques which can significantly improve data browsing experience in online shopping, dating, media recommendations, and many other applications. 

Two very common ways to explore large collections of imagery items, for instance, in online shopping, are to browse a hierarchy of items and to search with textual keywords. The returned results are browsed in lists, typically ordered by popularity. However, popularity is defined across all users as one homogeneous peoples, and users cannot sort by their own subjective criteria, e.g., by their own personal `style' for clothes; What is `stylish' to one person will be passe to another. Furthermore, there is no way to place items on a continuous scale, where the criteria amount for each item is known, e.g., how stylish a particular piece of clothing is to a user. 

Our goal is to develop new techniques which enable users to organize and explore imagery data based on their own subjective criteria at a high semantic level. This is a challenging problem: Many criteria are hard to quantify and a user may not even be able to articulate the criteria. 
We face this challenge by observing that even though users may not be able to specify their criteria quantitatively, or even fully describe them, they are still able to communicate their own notions by providing examples, e.g., &amp;quot;this shoe is cooler than that one&amp;quot;. Our goal is to build an algorithm that arranges a large corpus of visual data according to these examples. Once built, the arranged data can be browsed with an interface that exploits the learned criteria to navigate the continuous scale.

The key contributions of the proposed research will include 1) exploring different modes of user interaction and elaborate on reflecting the resulting knowledge to 2) a new algorithm that, by breaking the limitations of existing approaches, effectively and efficiently learns from user-provided examples and thereby makes personalized data exploration realistic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to develop new techniques which can significantly improve data browsing experience by enabling users to organize data collections based on their own subjective, semantic-level criteria. If successful, these techniques can be directly used in many applications that use/require data exploration. In particular, online shopping will be the biggest beneficiary of this research. The UK is one of the largest and ever growing markets in online shopping: As of November 2013, online shopping increased 10% over the year 2012 and revenues reached a monthly record of &amp;pound;10.1 billion. Specific application scenarios include
1) Finding the perfect chair for a user's room from thousands of possibilities across different styles, by ranking a small subset of chairs by preference.
2) Finding a tasty wine (in terms of personal preference) by trying a small number of different wines: Even novice users could easily establish their shopping portfolio, without having to gain knowledge of domain-specific keywords such as `Tannin' and `Tartaric Acid'.
This research will therefore, contribute to qualitative and quantitative growth of the online shopping market in the UK by attracting users with a significantly improved experience.

Online shopping is only an example of many data browsing applications. Additional application examples are
- Online dating (&amp;pound;170 million market in the UK): Attractiveness is personal-- ranking a small subset of people would help to tailor the personal matches you received by a personal appearance attractiveness scale.
- Media recommendation (e.g., Netflix, iTunes, Kindle): Ranking a few films, albums, or books in an online library to quickly organize the entire collection by your preference.

Our strategy for realizing such a browsing system is to make advances in machine learning, computer vision, and HCI. In particular, one of key technical contributions of this project will be an improved algorithm for semi-supervised learning. Since semi-superved learning is nowadays extensively used in diverse areas including data mining, social networks analysis, robotics, and genetics, in the long-term, this project will impact on a much broader range of economic and academic activities which may benefit from these techniques.

Furthermore, our techniques will have a societal impact by helping people save time: if successful, users would no longer have to spend hours hunting for just the right item. Users could sort by their particular criteria, and have a good chance of finding it within a small amount of time. Collectively, this saves people a lot of time, and makes the shopping experience or more generally, the data browsing experience, much more pleasant.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97877</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Max Planck Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Max Planck Institute for Informatics</gtr:department><gtr:description>User-centric image organization: collaboration with Brown University, Harvard University, and Max Planck Institute for Informatics</gtr:description><gtr:id>ABDCB4B8-340A-4BE7-B5A4-36D6F82B2F93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has led to several important published (plus unpublished so far) outcomes:

The grant has been transferred as the PI moved to another university: The transferred grant EP/M00533X/2 is still active. We are continuing to work on this project with the aim of producing bigger economical and societal impacts. Our techniques can be used in many applications that use/require imagery data exploration and editing. Potential beneficiaries include creative industries in particular in graphics, game, and animation, and (end-users of) online shopping and media recommendation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9514D254-7E7A-4E8A-9BC1-3EC0AECE4748</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56cdce5a04ea22.06512183</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The goal of this project is to develop new techniques which enable users to organize and explore imagery data based on their own subjective criteria at a high semantic level.

We have developed a set of machine learning algorithms to allow users to communicate these criteria without having to know how that criteria might be formed or described at the data level [1,3,4,5].

One challenge in approaching this problem was the lack of ground-truth labels on which machine learning algorithms can be trained since users would not want to spend hours to provide labels. Our approach is to leverage the machine learning process from a set of labeled data points with a large set of unlabeled data points (i.e., data instances that are not explicitly labeled by users). It has been recently found that the well-established graph Laplacian-based semi-supervised algorithms can overfit to data, i.e., we obtain a machine which explains the training data perfectly but cannot generalize to new data.

We developed new semi-supervised learning algorithms that circumvent this problem and enable stable generalization of given labels to the entire unlabeled datasets [1,3,4,5]. Furthermore, we applied these algorithms and the principle of user-guided machine learning to developing
1) an interactive system that enables users to personalize the character controller for synthesizing animations in video games and animations [6]. 
2) a new 3D shape data exploration framework that enables users to define their own distance measures facilitating semantics-level data retrieval [2].
