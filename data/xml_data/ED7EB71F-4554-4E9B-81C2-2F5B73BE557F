These images will challenge the viewer to readdress his or her ideas about 'the type of people' represented. Subjects will be depicted normally, but the settings in which they are located will be altered digitally to coincide with the perceptual experiences described by each person. This interdisciplinary project will draw on the conventions of portraiture, on scientific understandings of the inner worlds of those who experience psychotic states and on the lived experiences of affected individuals. I will use digital manipulation to create images that subvert established pictorial conventions and, in doing so, question conventional ways of thinking about and relating to people with mental illness.\n\nThe term psychosis literally means 'abnormal condition of the mind'. It is used to indicate a mental state often described as involving a 'loss of contact with reality'. Schizophrenia is a general term for a group of psychotic disorders characterized by long term disturbances in perception, affect, behaviour, and communication. A person's lived experience of psychosis could be seen to contradict accepted notions of what constitutes 'reality'. In fact, the involuntary loss of a 'normal' sense of reality is an aspect of human experience that remains stigmatized because we cannot account for it. The proposed photographs will form an essential contribution to my ongoing project of making work that challenges established conceptions of the relationships between identity, subjectivity and what is 'normal'. It will build on previous photographic projects such as After Image (1997), 'I' (1999) and Skin (2000), made in collaboration with people with physical disabilities or severe skin conditions.\n\nThe imagery I create as a result of this new research will be inspired by the symbolism and style of historical portrait paintings. The purpose of the type of painting that I will refer to is usually to aggrandize and dignify the individual by showing him or her in an ornate interior, or outdoors as a wealthy landowner. In these paintings the subject of the portrait is characterized visually, using a number of symbolic and narrative elements. The subjects of my work will be people whose ability to function within society has been affected by the experience of mental illness. I am interested in the challenge of creating a series of believable, realistic images that reveal something of the chaotic and sometimes incomprehensible inner worlds of the people portrayed. Based on the physiognomic belief that a person's appearance mirrors his or her subjectivity or 'inner' identity, a traditional concern of portraiture has been to create an external 'likeness' of someone. In depicting both the external appearance and the internal experiences of the subjects, I aim to create rich and compelling images that will bring mental health issues into the public domain. These images will also provide a means of publicly representing the experiences of people whose sense of reality does not always coincide with that of 'normal' people. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal investigator will manage all the impact activities relating to this project, during both the research and dissemination phases. \n\nBeneficiaries of the project will include people who experience intermittent or short-term psychoses, in particular those who participate in the research. The process of devising a means of visual representation for their unique perceptual experiences should be both cathartic and rewarding for participants of the research phase of the project. As principle investigator I will undertake this research and, under the guidance of staff at Kings College Institute of Psychiatry, will ensure that the research is conducted in such a way that it not only informs the outcome of the project, but is also of maximum benefit to participants themselves. All participants will be free to engage with the project as much or as little as they wish and can withdraw from it at any point. At the end of the grant period each person will be asked to complete a written consent form, giving permission for his or her image to be exhibited publicly. \n\nThe photographs will be exhibited in hospitals such as the Maudsley in South London, where patients, families and medical professionals will be able to see them. One of the project partners, Dr Heidi Lemppe, who is a senior qualitative researcher at Kings College and a specialist in medical education, will help to facilitate this exhibition. (Please see attached letter of support from Professor Thornicroft at Kings College Department of Psychiatry). I have a longstanding track record of exhibiting in medical contexts. \n\nThe photographs will also be exhibited in art galleries and museums that attract a broad audience, both in this country and abroad. In this case, artists, arts organizations and the gallery going public will benefit from the project. \n\nI am currently in conversation with the Freud museum in North London. This is a new connection, established with a view to exhibiting the photographs at the museum. The context of psychoanalysis will offer a framework for investigating particular theoretical interpretations of what constitutes reality. \n\nThe cost of producing the photographs for exhibition will be in the region of &amp;pound;15,000. It is anticipated that the costs of mounting exhibitions, openings and publicity will be covered by the venues. \n\nThe public will benefit from seeing the work online. It will be documented at: www.alexawright.com. This site was visited more than 8000 times in 2009. I will upload the works myself, so the cost of this will be minimal. \n\nAfter winning the 'Beauty' category in Channel 4 Year 1 photography competition an image depicting the hands of a woman with Vitiligo from my previous photographic work 'Skin' (2000) was used by the Vitiligo society in a promotional campaign. Mental health charities such as Mind could benefit in a similar way by using one or more of the photographs from this new series in a promotional or informative context.\n\nAt the end of the research period a select group of forty to fifty artists, arts professionals, mental health professionals and service users will be invited to a symposium at University of Westminster on the theme of 'Otherness', with a focus on the role of visual representation of psychological differences. \n\nCopyright for the work will remain with the artist. It is unlikely that the project will generate intellectual property of any commercial value. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66133</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A View From Inside (2012) is a series of ten digital C-type photographs, framed, 100 x 76cm.

The aim was not to exoticise the 'unreal' or bizarre perceptual experiences of the people portrayed, but to use digital media both to explore this notion of 'reality', and to find a visual language that will provoke discussion and add to our understanding of the experience of mental illness, and of psychosis in particular.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E1B16CF-4887-4B83-88FA-250EC4132F21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A View from Inside follows my earlier projects such as the award-winning series, After Image (1997), which pioneered the use of Photoshop to question the nature of portraiture. Using the medium of digitally manipulated photography in a way that simultaneously draws on and subverts the traditions of both painting and photography, this research project &amp;quot;realises&amp;quot; the subjective experiences of its subjects in a new way. Participants were consulted throughout the project, and played an active role in the decision-making process. In many cases this impacted on the person's self esteem and relationship with his/her experiences whilst unwell. Part of the intention of this work was to help reduce the stigma around mental ill-health. The photographs have been exhibited in art galleries and museums, and the project was the subject of a short BBC documentary, 'Postcards from Another Person's Reality', Rachael Buchannan, April 10, 2012.

An interactive exhibition focusing on medicine, memory and the treatment process as part of the Liverpool Biennial 2016 Fringe. 

Phantom Limb is an exhibition of around 20 works by nine artists, most of whom work from their own personal experiences of operations and illnesses. 

It focuses on medicine and the psychological impact of the treatment process, in particular how memory physically and mentally affects illness, how pain impacts on memory and cognitive functioning and how memory impacts on pain physically (e.g. phantom pain) and mentally through trauma. It also considers the effect memory has on mental illness. 

The exhibition is a partnership project between award-winning artist Euan Gray, and Dr Daniel Whistler, from the University's Centre for Health, Arts and Science.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5841b6eba92738.19393650</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://vgm.liverpool.ac.uk/whats-on/special-exhibitions/phantomlimb/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Portas Abertas</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7C41A861-8A10-430E-A292-C6927D1BBD46</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Portas Abertas was an international artistic project organised by F&amp;oacute;rum Eug&amp;eacute;nio de Almeida on the occasion of its opening in the former Pal&amp;aacute;cio da Inquisi&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o (Palace of the Inquisition), in &amp;Eacute;vora, Portugal.

Whilst the people I have photographed here all appear entirely 'normal', their ability to function within society has, to varying degrees, been affected by the experience of a psychotic 'disorder' such as Bipolar or Schizophrenia. Visual, auditory and other sensory phenomena experienced by someone during a psychotic episode contradict accepted notions of what constitutes 'reality', and yet for that person they are absolutely real. The disorder and disruption arising out of even a temporary detachment from consensual reality can be immense, as the first-hand accounts documented in a book accompanying the images demonstrate.



In making 'A View from Inside' I was interested in the challenge of creating believable, realistic pictures that reveal some of the chaotic and sometimes incomprehensible experiences that are present for an individual during psychosis, but are not accessible to anyone else. In these photographs the physical expression of the subject reveals nothing of his or her inner world. It is the (highly constructed) setting -which in each case incorporates a view through a window and an array of significant objects - that gives some clue to each individual's private world. 

Having visited many potential locations for these portraits, I was drawn to sumptuous (but faded) eighteenth century interiors because of their elegant symmetry and sense of order. Each of the chosen sites seemed to offer a suitable setting for the unusual array of objects it was to host, and at the same time to characterize the atmosphere of a particular psychotic episode, or series of episodes. Although I have digitally reconstructed most of the rooms depicted to create places that don't quite exist in the 'real' world, the components of each space (doors, windows, walls etc.) were all derived from the same location. 

Everyone involved in the project volunteered to participate, most in response to a call put out by 'Rethink Mental Illness', which elicited nearly a hundred responses. On a personal level, I was impressed by the courage and generosity of all the people who have worked with me on this project. The images have, by necessity, been arrived at collaboratively. In each case my visual interpretations were discussed with the person depicted, and then modified to arrive at a final image that characterizes his or her recollected experiences. The aim has been to find a form for the seemingly irrational events that people described, whilst retaining some sort of pictorial logic. 


The photographs and book created as a result of this grant aim to help people to think again when treating someone with a mental illness differently out of fear, misunderstanding or prejudice. By giving form to some of the fascinating psychotic experiences of a small group of randomly selected people, the portraits also provide a stimulus for questioning our established, consensual understanding of what constitutes reality. I plan to continue this research during a residency at Camden and Islington Foundation Trust in 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The ten photographic portraits have been and continue to be exhibited in art galleries, museums and other public spaces. As well as acting as a catalogue for the exhibition, the book has been distributed widely. The mental health charity Rethink Mental Illness have supported its distribution. 



A short film about the project is currently in production and will be aired on the health page of the BBC website in January 2012 to co-incide with the launch of the book.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD13F8C1-671E-4B40-BDD9-E317CEF9A449</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2905381697.1419217762d8e4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I00162X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
