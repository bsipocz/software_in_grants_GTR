The Riemann-Hilbert problem, which can be described as a problem of finding an analytic function in the complex plane with a prescribed jump across a given curve, is closely connected to one-dimensional singular integral operators, convolution operators, Toeplitz operators, and Wiener-Hopf operators. In these several different forms, the problem has attracted many famous mathematicians. The research area continues to expand rapidly and find new applications in many (applied) fields of mathematics, in (mathematical) physics and even in chemistry.

A great deal of the current importance of the RHP is due to its use in random matrix theory, orthogonal polynomials and integrable systems. The Riemann-Hilbert method for integrable PDEs originated in the works of Manakov, Shabat, and Zakharov in 1975-1979, and since then it has been widely used in soliton theory. The Riemann-Hilbert approach to quantum exactly solvable models was most recently developed in the 1990s in the series of works by Its, Izergin, Korepin, Slavnov, Deift, and Zhou. The Riemann-Hilbert approach to orthogonal polynomials and matrix models was initiated in 1991 by Its, Fokas, and Kitaev, which has led to solving some of the long-standing problems in the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials related to universalities in random matrices. 

The relations between random matrix models and classical integrable systems appear in deformation theory, when parameters characterizing the measures or the domain of localization of the eigenvalues are varied. The resulting differential equations determining the partition function and correlation functions are, remarkably, of the same type as certain equations appearing in the theory of integrable systems. They may be analyzed effectively through methods based on the RHP and by related approaches to the study of nonlinear asymptotics in the large N limit.

Many of the aforementioned applications arise via certain classes of operators and infinite matrices, namely Toeplitz and Hankel matrices, and require the study of the asymptotics of their determinants when the size of the matrix goes to infinity. The study of Toeplitz matrices and determinants was initiated by Otto Toeplitz in 1907 to find concrete examples of Hilbert's general theory of functional analysis. A great variety of problems in mathematics, physics and engineering can be expressed in terms of these matrices; in particular in areas such as function theory, probability theory, statistics, and statistical mechanics, including Kaufman and Onsager's work on the Ising model.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will produce results which are relevant to applied complex analysis, operator theory, spectral theory, and applications in mathematical physics, especially in random matrix theory. It has also the potential to contribute to numerical analysis, analytic number theory, and even to some areas of physics. Riemann-Hilbert problems form an important application of complex analysis, operator theory and functional analysis in the context of random matrix theory, orthogonal polynomials and integrable systems. In the wider context, RHPs have various other important applications in many other areas of mathematics and its applications. The main motivation for this project comes from random matrix theory and developing new methods in pure analysis.

Results of this project will be disseminated through publications in scientific journals, maintaining a website on the developments of the proposed research, attending scientific events, and collaborating with researchers in mathematics, applied mathematics, and mathematical physics. Teaching activities, such as organizing summer schools in this area, supervising PhD students, and possibly introducing undergraduate students to some of the topics of the proposed research, e.g. as part of undergraduate research summer placements funded by the University of Reading and/or the London Mathematical Society, also contribute to the wider impact.

This project, especially the more applied side of it, will benefit from the expertise of several leading scientists in the field. As mentioned in the previous section I will make visits to New York University and Indiana University--Purdue University Indianapolis. Percy Deift (NYU) is a leading expert in the field of Riemann-Hilbert problems, spectral theory, integrable systems and orthogonal polynomials. Deift has been involved in developing powerful analytic methods in the field, authored several important papers, and written books on the subject of RHPs, orthogonal polynomials, random matrices, and their applications. Alexander Its (IUPUI) is another leading expert, whose research interests include asymptotic analysis of matrix models and orthogonal polynomials via RHPs, the asymptotic analysis of quantum exactly solvable models, and the theory of Fredholm and Toeplitz operators, and Painleve equations.

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Reading provides an active environment to share and exchange ideas related to the proposed research. This includes regular seminar series in analysis and pure mathematics, hosting other scientific events, and many members interested in the topics of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D4882EE9-7542-4BCA-A014-433C17290B18</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wigner's theorem on Grassmann spaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Functional Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2139b272a09c2dc742ff16589a3f232c"><gtr:id>2139b272a09c2dc742ff16589a3f232c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Geh?r G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe105c4ea11.21745621</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7B115598-9BDC-4B9C-BC8B-EFD11566076B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Toeplitz operators on Dirichlet-Besov spaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Houston Journal of Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/07948dfcb7c6b018cf187fc43bc43591"><gtr:id>07948dfcb7c6b018cf187fc43bc43591</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Per?l?
