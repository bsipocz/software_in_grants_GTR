The United Nations (UN) and its interaction with religious non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are a focal point for innovative understanding and insight about how religious and political worlds interact. The UN, founded in 1945 to maintain international peace after the 2nd World War, is the only international organization that represents every country in the world. It works across areas of law, development, economy, rights and peace and from its foundation it aimed to work closely with NGOs (private, non-governmental groups, with specific concerns and interests, such as Amnesty International). In Article 71 of the UN Charter it stated that the UN would 'consult' with NGOs to carry out its work through one of its central committees, the Economic and Social Council. Religious organizations have collaborated with the UN since its foundation and in 1972 there was the establishment of the Committee of Religious NGOs at the UN (http://www.rngo.org/); with an annual report of activity and listing 108 different religious groups as its members from the American Baptist Church to the World YWCA. Since the 1990s there has been an increase in the role of 'religious' NGOs and their contributions to UN committees in New York and Geneva. Religious NGO representatives are now active on many UN Committees and UN Commissions, including, for example, the UN Commission for Social Development. They have also played important roles in bringing about UN resolutions on world debt, with the Jubilee Foundation, and restrictions on landmine use. The increasing presence of religious NGOs was given extra weight in recent years when the Secretary General of the UN supported grass root collaboration for UN activity.\n\nIn a world of global organization and ever increasing involvement of - very diverse - religious NGOs influencing international political decisions and processes, we need to know not only about their type, density and number, but also about their own motivations, rationale and success in their involvement in UN decision-making. What we need to know about these groups is how and why religious groups engage with high-level lobbying and diplomacy at the UN. We need to understand how the mission statements of religious NGOs direct them to commit resources to UN engagement, how effective they are in delivering services according to their own mission statements and how they are perceived by UN diplomats. This is important because we need to understand who these groups represent and the aims of their lobbying in shaping our world. There have been few independent studies examining these questions and the previous studies only mapped type and density. We are now at an important second, interdisciplinary, stage of inquiry and it requires sufficient resources to employ a researcher at the main UN sites (New York and Geneva) to investigate these issues. It also requires an international team, including a specialist in International Relations and UN studies, a scholar of religion to understand the conceptual, theoretical and classificatory issues, a sociologist with specialist NGO knowledge and data gathering skills, NGO consultants (UN Office of the Bahai International Community and the Quaker UN Office) and diplomatic support. The researchers will provide new empirical data from a two-year snap-shot of religious NGO activity at the UN. This will be carried out by textual analysis, interviews with NGO leaders and members, surveys of NGO activity and resources, case studies of specific groups and questionnaires to evaluate the perceived status of such groups by UN diplomats. Through its rigorous empirical analysis, the research will offer innovative thinking about religion in global governance. It will be the first comprehensive study of religious NGOs at the UN and of important international interest.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project has direct value for building global sustainable communities by focussing on a phenomenon that has become increasingly part of international governance, peace and relief work. It has support from two linked religious NGO agencies, the Bahai UN Office, New York, and the Quaker UN Office, Geneva, and diplomatic support from the UN Mission to the Vatican, Ambassador Campbell. In addition, there has been expressed interest in the research Findings Report from both the UK Mission to the UN, Geneva, and the UK Mission to the UN, New York (see detailed Impact Plan). As UNICEF (United Nations Children's Relief Agency) Civil Partnership Program Officer, Stephen Hanmer, recognised, understanding religious NGOs is the 'missing link' in UN work. He expressed interest in receiving the proposed end user Findings Report and exploring UN agency use of the project results. This interest in the research project by UN agency workers reveals the increasing profile of religious NGOs and their embedded nature in international relief and human rights work, not least through the religious NGOs infrastructure outside the nation-state apparatus. While the project emerges out of the academic concerns to highlight, analyze and conceptually understand the post-1990s legitimacy of religious NGOs it is - by its nature and expressed stakeholder interest - constructed in collaboration with linked agencies and thus the work defines its own global impact on international policy and relief agency work. In order to respond to this impact, the project decided - in addition to academic studies - to establish a Findings Report for distribution to hundreds of worldwide interested groups, an information webpage and, importantly, an End User Group. This group has representatives from key policy organisations (UN Association UK, APRODEVC with links to EU policy forums, an academic specialist on NGOs and social policy, religious NGO representatives). This group will comment on drafts of the Findings Report to ensure information is accessible for political think-tanks, policy groups and agency workers. It will also help identify wider interested agencies for increased dissemination. The User Group will first meet at the end of year 2 (September 2011) to carry out this process and the report will form the basis of a series of media launches/talks for the Findings Report in five international locations: London, UN New York, UN Geneva, Brussels (EU constituents) and Paris (UNESCO). The London based journalist Mark Vernon will assist the project through its year-three dissemination stage. He will translate the academic concepts into media friendly concepts for maximum exposure and use value. He will also work through press-releases to various think-tanks and religious groups to enlist them, alongside agency workers and journalists, to attend the media launches. He will also write articles in newspapers, such as The Guardian, with the aim of showing the project's social and political importance. In order to exploit and ensure maximum potential impact and effective response to the international stakeholder interest, an administrative assistant is employed for the final year to facilitate communication and dissemination, including web-design. Finally, while we recognise the interest of the findings at a global and national level, it was also apparent through the UN Association UK that there were numerous local groups and wider public interest groups. We have thus enlisted two local groups for talks and presentations, the Canterbury UN Association UK and the Canterbury Inter-Faith Group and will use their related national networks for public information talks. The links with APRODEV, EU policy forums, and a University of Kent, Brussels campus, lecture series will set the ground for a post-project examination of religious NGOs in the EU and the establishment of</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>427736</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dissemination Event 3: Big Society or Global Village?

The booklet was registered and commented upon in various UN groups and NGOs and is subject to on-going debate e.g http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/01/united-nations-too-christian-claims.html

The media attention featured on the AHRC webpage.

Numerous NGOs at the UN and those working in the international UN community have requested copies of the findings and on-going work is being developed in relation to the findings, not least related to the central finding about Asian NGOs at the UN.

According to the University of Kent Communications department, the report and its media attention generated a PR value of &amp;pound;59,099.31 and had a reach (media hits) of 3,190.058 (as of the 31st January 2015). The work also had the media blog on the Westminster Faith Debates site (http://faithdebates.org.uk/blog/religion-united-nations-jeremy-carrette/) and the on-line journal Open Democracy (http://www.opendemocracy.net/openglobalrights/jeremy-carrette/paradox-of-religion-and-rights).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B700D368-57A0-492F-B7CC-16EB3956BB52</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cce70f0d391.73288202</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Some of the key questionnaire findings from 192 registered consultative status NGOs at the UN. Incorporating 58 religious NGOs, 24% of the estimated population of religious NGOs.

1. Religion is not a classification used by the UN for registered NGOs and data is thus difficult to gather because of classification problems. The project confirmed previous estimates that the proportion of religious NGOs with consultative status at the UN was in the region of 7%-10%. Previous studies were Religion Counts (2000) 9%; Berger (2003) 8.77% and Petersen (10.1%). Our Religion and Society data gave 7.29%; although we deployed a spectrum model to allow more nuanced representation (secular with religious roots, faith-based, religious, ethnic-cultural, spiritual), but it might suggest a drop in self-identifying NGOs as religious. In the spectrum model we found the highest representation in faith-based rather than religious NGOs.

2. Over 45% of religious NGOs are Christian, which reflects something of the historical development of civil society in Christianity and the history of the UN, but this is also a reflection of funding and priority given to in-country work rather than central UN agency work (particularly with traditions from Asia) and the way Islamic countries work through the OIC block rather than civil society: this relates to finding 3 below. There are proportionally very few Hindu and Buddhist NGOs working at the UN in New York and Geneva (we explored one unique example of Hindu engagement the Bharat Sevashram Sangha).

3. To understand &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot; NGOs at the UN you have to understand the place of &amp;quot;religion&amp;quot; in the UN system; a weakness of previous studies. There are structural and institutional correlations between manifestations of religious-groups in civil society and representation of religion in State and UN sectors (notably OIC and Holy See positions and lack of representation of diverse religious traditions in structural positions at the UN). The international UN governance system thus reflects a Western-Christian bias in its formation and structure and is not reflective of the diversity of religious traditions in UN State countries. There is also a correlation between ideas of civil society and the religious history of the UN.


4. In-Country religious representation is of greater importance to diplomats than central agency UN NGO &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot; representation. Religious groups are more effective at the UN if they are able to deploy strategic assimilation into the UN system issue-based concerns rather than promote specific &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot; concerns. 

5. The four key references to religion in the UN Declaration of Human Rights reflect the position of religion an individual right within international politics and there are issues around the collective representation of religion, as seen in the Defamation of Religion debate. 

6. There is a fundamental tension between Human Rights of Women and the Freedom of Religion and Belief, due to the historical link between patriarchy and religion. It is difficult to get the big secular NGO groups to attend committees working on Freedom of Religion and Belief.

7. Religious issues emerge most significantly in the context of &amp;quot;cultural&amp;quot; concerns. The United Nations Alliance of Civilization is the most effective forum for international debate about the place of religion and cultural misunderstandings about religion. (It is our policy recommendation that the UK government look at ways of support this part of the UN programme.)

8. In terms of issues of concern for NGOs and religious NGOs we found:
(a.) Religious NGOs are more likely than secular NGOs to be involved in Religious Freedom, Human Rights and Peace.
(b.) NGOs from Global South are more likely than NGOs from the Global North to be involved in Children's Rights, Disabilities, HIV/AIDS and Indigenous Peoples 
(c.) RNGOs are also more likely to be involved in Disarmament and Refugees/Displaced Persons
(d.) Southern NGOs are more likely to be involved in Education
(e.) Northern NGOs are more likely to be involved in Gender Violence and Refugees/Displace Persons
 
9. There is a North-South divided in terms of NGO representation. Religious NGOs (compared to Secular NGOs) are disproportionately from the global NORTH. This shows that governance instruments have not changed significantly since the Brandt Report in 1980 on the north-south divide. The claim that religion is a way of bringing in greater regional diversity from the south is not supported.
 
10. Funding varies enormously across NGOs. In terms of funding:
(a.) Religious NGOs are more dependent on religious adherents.
(b.) Secular NGOs (compared to religious NGOs) rely more on funding from governments and IGOs
(c.) Northern NGOs (compared to southern NGOs) rely more on funding from governments and individual donors
(d.) Southern NGOs rely more on funding from IGOs.

11. The NGO Religions for Peace was to be found the most active in putting on Side Events at the UN.

12. Activities at the UN in New York showed three distinct groups of engagement between religion and the UN: (1) Initiating (networks) (2) Integrated (Joint Initiatives) and (3) Immersed (formal UN processes). There is an important distinction to be made between networks outside the UN and formal committees inside the UN. For example, the Committee for Religious NGOs is external to the UN formal processes.

13. There are three main types of &amp;quot;religious NGOs&amp;quot;: those linked to a distinct religious tradition, interfaith groups and spiritual-esoteric. The UN's global vision attracts a number of fringe groups, which may not attain consultative status, but who engage with some of the religious NGO networks.

14. It is necessary to make a distinction between two types of engagement: advocacy and lobbying. Many religious groups engage with issues and concerns on behalf of other groups/causes, but few actively lobby for their own concerns unless there is a Human Rights issue e.g. Bahai. 

15. The UN Inter-Faith Harmony week in February has developed a positive ritual for recognition and understanding of religious and cultural diversity, but this ritual function exits in tension with the political realism in world politics. This reflects an important ritual function of the UN to establish what we have called &amp;quot;rituals of hope&amp;quot;.

16. Diplomats are not concerned with the religious nature of NGOs, unless there is a political representation in-country which allows for a political sensitivity (e.g. Catholic NGOs in Poland). Diplomats appreciate issue based engagement with NGOs and become cautious of any specific religious content unless it is related to UN protocols and Human Rights.

17. Religious and secular NGOs are largely service sector actors to State power. The UN is a State-club which depends on State power and funds, thus NGOs can shape concerns and issues but only where it dovetails with individual State actor interests.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Revision of working practices of the United Nations and NGOs working at the United Nations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C5D10709-F472-4546-852F-8A9D13DAD601</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cd00f406b05.95795403</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.kent.ac.uk/rngo/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7935705-F3DB-4090-8B5A-0383EC7FC8D0</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Les ONGs religieuses face aux Etats' in Justice, Religion, R&amp;eacute;conciliation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ce15b3583612b0839e1abcb7dac5cb32"><gtr:id>ce15b3583612b0839e1abcb7dac5cb32</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sophie-Helene Trigeaud</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>2343033110</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545ca6e959d156.81655128</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F24F9EC2-7EE1-43B8-9FDC-A48A2BF0782D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religious NGOs and the United Nations in New York and Geneva</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/89d695fc20e37ce706e0efa3a94b85ef"><gtr:id>89d695fc20e37ce706e0efa3a94b85ef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jeremy Carrette</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545cb55c2e89e9.18468753</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34272F7E-A722-4BE8-AE0B-CAC82FF0A776</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;lt;&amp;lt; Travaux d'aiguilles et mobilisation f&amp;eacute;minine : des plaines de l'Utah aux Nations Unies &amp;gt;&amp;gt;.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Anthropologica Canada's Anthropology Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c3c2ae15b369bfc551736b3ffb934fcc"><gtr:id>c3c2ae15b369bfc551736b3ffb934fcc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Trigeaud, Sophie-Helene</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e1479f451df3.06865847</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F14364E8-80FD-4357-81BE-9D7E77CCBDA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>'The Paradox of Hegemony and Plurality: Religious NGOs, Globalization and International Institutions in The Local and the Global' in Religions in Movement: The Local and the Global in Contemporary Faith Traditions ed.
