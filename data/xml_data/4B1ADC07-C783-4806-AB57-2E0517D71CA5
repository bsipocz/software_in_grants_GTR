Chinese measure of inclusion that can be used to assess inclusion in disadvantaged groups such as immigrant groups and
people with mental health problems. We will compare some new results for the Chinese version with results from the
original research in the UK in several samples: people with mental health problems in the Hong Kong (HK) resident and
immigrant populations, and Chinese immigrants in the UK.
The advantages of cross-cultural comparison have been reported as testing the boundaries of knowledge and stretching
methodological parameters; highlighting important similarities and differences; and the promotion of institutional and
intercultural exchange and understanding. The present proposal looks at these matters in relation to the concept of social
inclusion in the UK and HK. While we recognise that the concept of social inclusion is a contested one, for the purposes of
the current proposal we accept the World Bank definition. Social Inclusion (SI) refers to promoting equal access to
opportunities, enabling everyone to contribute to social and economic program and share in its rewards.
Interest in cross-cultural measurement issues has grown rapidly since the turn of the century. Although psychologists have
taken the lead on measurement issues social work researchers have recognised the importance of developing
crosscultural measurement for the profession, especially for work with minority and immigrant groups. Most authors agree
on the fundamental areas in which the new questionnaire should be shown to be equivalent to the original one. These
include the concept itself, the questions used to assess it, the precise wording of these questions, and the meaning of the
words used in the different languages. Technically, the way each of the items (or variables) relate to each other and to the
underlying concepts should be the same in both cultures, for full equivalence to be demonstrated.
A number of cross-cultural translation guides have become available over the years which provide guidance about adapting
measures for other cultures. Taking into consideration the various available guides, for the purposes of this research we
are adopting the guidance from a leading French research institute, which suggests that we proceed as follows. First we
need to speak to groups of people in HK to see to what extent their views about the nature of the concept are similar or
dissimilar to those in the UK. To do this we use a method known as 'concept mapping'. We then have experts examine the
extent to which the items in the UK measure capture these ideas. At this point it may be necessary to add additional items
to the new version. We then translate the UK version into Chinese, and back again, and reconcile and clarify any
difference. The new version is then piloted in the Chinese communities, and any difficulties ironed out.
Once we have obtained an acceptable version of the measure, following piloting we will then apply the measure to different
samples. One will be of discharged mental patients in HK and these will be compared to similar patients in the UK to see if
their nature and levels of inclusion are similar or not. Another will be of Chinese immigrants to the UK to see if their levels
of inclusion are more similar to UK population or HK residents and immigrants. Finally, we will assess whether the new
measure compares in the way it should with a widely used standardised measure, and a measure of recovery.
The measure and these findings will provide the basis for further community research in Hong Kong, mainland China and in
Chinese immigrant communities in other parts of the world. Social inclusion policy impact could be evaluated in these
contexts and social interventions could demonstrate how they have helped people to become more included in society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Social policies in both Wales and England aim to demonstrate that they are able to help and support people from
disadvantaged and disabled groups to engage in meaningful activity in the social mainstream. Use of the SCOPE and
SCOPE-C could be instrumental in enabling them to measure the efficacy of their social interventions.
Int'l Co-I (Chui) has good links and association with NGOs in Hong Kong who run rehabilitation services for people with mental
illness. The proposed research, when carried out, will generate valid measurement tools for Hong Kong where valid
outcome measures are badly needed to raise service accountability, service efficacy, and to promote evidence-based
practice and service evaluation. This is particularly important as rehabilitation services are undergoing a re-structuring in
the direction of integration and a more community based approach. It is expected both social and healthcare services,
government or non-government organizations, will benefit from the study. The fruits of the study will also benefit future
research in the form of handy baseline measures for helping professions and healthcare services, providing reliable
yardsticks for policy making on social inclusion, and making it possible for Hong Kong to take part in international multi-site
studies in connection with outcome measures.
Some organisations may wish to use the SI measure as an audit tool, or as a routine outcome measure for those social
and health care providers whose goal is to promote inclusion for disadvantaged groups. Betsi Cadwallader University
Health Board and the local authority in Wrexham have used one of our measures to conduct such an audit and to arrange
services to meet the identified aspirations of the users of services (see also the ESRC examples of impact, below). For
example:
Enhancing cultural enrichment, quality of life, health and well-being: Direct impact on services and service users. Measure
can be used to assess progress towards individual inclusion goals. Data can be aggregated to assess performance of
services.
Contributing towards evidence based policy-making and influencing public policies and legislation at a local level: In
Wrexham, audit and then system level changes showed that social inclusion for service users improved. Provides a tool for
managers and clinical teams to self-assess performance in relation to inclusion and mainstreaming goals.
Shaping and enhancing the effectiveness of public services: Wrexham changed service configurations and pathways on
the basis of the audit that included service user goals for mainstreaming etc. Concentrated on user identified priorities and not organisational integration.
Transforming evidence based policy in practice and influencing and informing practitioners and professional practice:
Individual professionals and teams can adopt this kind of assessment and then focus on the service user priorities. In
Wrexham the organisations involved improved access to facilities for people with mental health problems.
Improving social welfare, social cohesion: Helps clinical services to take a holistic view of service user needs rather than
focusing only on symptoms. This leads to improved outcomes for service users and thereby improves social welfare
provision.
Changing organisational culture and practices: Wrexham changed referral practices and removed obstacles to inclusion.
Enhancing the research capacity, knowledge and skills of businesses and organisations: Provides the services with a tool
to evaluate their own services and compare themselves with population norms and other providers.
Contributing toward wealth creation and economic prosperity i.e. the creation and growth of companies and jobs;
enhancing business revenue and innovative capacity: those people who are enabled to engage in paid employment will be
contributing to economic prosperity through performing a useful function, paying taxes, and coming off state benefits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28325</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical University of Gdansk</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Poland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Public Health and Social Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>New member joining the research team to collect data in Poland</gtr:description><gtr:id>666BDBF7-A683-4F87-A246-DF3D7A6FA71B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Application of grant in progress now</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589c1da73bda43.14799942-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The research partner and the existing team will apply for a research grant from Hong Kong Baptist University to develop the SCOPE-P and collect data among mental health services users in Poland.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Prof Kara Chan of the research team recruited this new member through her social network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Hospitals</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> Measuring social inclusion among Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom using SCOPE, Richard Charles Lee Canada-Hong Kong Library, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, May 24.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>735E789C-B8E7-47CE-B268-0B779092BA3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 15 general public attended, which sparked questions and discussion.

The study produced a Chinese-language measure of social inclusion (SCOPE-C) based on translation and cultural adaptation of the Social and Community Opportunities Profile (SCOPE) developed in UK. 
2. A focus group involving concept mapping was conducted to investigate the understanding of social inclusion among various social groups (social workers, seniors, community residents, mental health services users/ university students, and non-professional NGO workers) in September 2012. The major themes identified included material resources and wealth, work, social harmony and freedom from discrimination, as well as communication and community participation. These themes were similar to those found in the UK conceptual mapping study. 
3. As the concept mapping of social inclusion shared much similarity between the UK and HK participants, the SCOPE was translated into Chinese, and back-translated into English, and any differences resolved and explained. The final SCOPE-C questionnaire consisted of 56 items. It was piloted to test appropriateness and acceptability before being used in Hong Kong samples. Three rounds of face-to-face data collection were conducted among 168 Chinese mental health services users recruited through NGOs (October 2013 to July 2014). 
4. Results showed that satisfaction with opportunities to participate scores were higher than the perceived opportunity scores. Contrary to findings of the conceptual mapping study, participants did not often encounter discrimination in their daily life. Their perceived general health was between average and good. The overall social inclusion, average satisfaction with opportunities, and average perceived opportunities had significant positive correlation with one another, and all were positively correlated with respondents' physical health, but not mental health. Recovery score correlated significantly and positively with the physical health, mental health, and overall social inclusion. Ten of the eleven subscales of recovery correlated significantly and positively with overall social inclusion, lending support to the validity of SCOPE-C. 
5. SCOPE-C was used to collect data from 56 new arrivals from Mainland China in Hong Kong through NGOs in face-to-face individual interviews. The results were compared with the 51 immigrants in UK collected previously. Both Hong Kong and UK participants reported high overall social inclusion. The two sub-samples shared many similarities in the perceived opportunities and satisfaction of opportunities in various social domains. Immigrants in Hong Kong, a host society with similar language, demonstrated higher perceived satisfaction with opportunities in contact with friends and family, as well as higher perceived opportunities for community involvement than Chinese immigrants in UK, a society with a different language. However, overall social inclusion appeared to be independent of health conditions.
6. Among the mental health services user sample, SCOPE-C demonstrated high test-retest reliability over two weeks and six-months. Exploratory factor analysis found that mentally unhealthy and the general population sub-samples in UK, as well as the mentally unhealthy sub-sample in Hong Kong were similar in the factor structure. Self-rated &amp;quot;overall social inclusion&amp;quot; differed significantly among all of the samples, with the healthy population feeling more included than the groups with mental illness</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results can be compared with the results from other studies using the SCOPE (already in use in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and Brazil). The instrument can be tested on mainland China where there is scope for the study of social inclusion in community groups, mental health service users and migrant workers. We are working with the medical university in Shanghai on this issue.
Similar studies of the impact of refugee status on social inclusion in the host country will also be possible.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EF8910FD-C921-4A56-B1C7-EB57DE5F0AD3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56af7d1a8983c3.38542407</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>457526EB-70AC-4B64-97A8-CEF94E2DA052</gtr:id><gtr:title>The social and community opportunities profile social inclusion measure: Structural equivalence and differential item functioning in community mental health residents in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The International journal of social psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/feb63f3d6638cb8cb7f9a96cf8c2ff72"><gtr:id>feb63f3d6638cb8cb7f9a96cf8c2ff72</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Huxley PJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0020-7640</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>566065c959d472.98012991</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>82CB6BF2-6A14-4745-A6B8-F30BFEFB5614</gtr:id><gtr:title>Application of SCOPE-C to Measure Social Inclusion Among Mental Health Services Users in Hong Kong.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Community mental health journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e"><gtr:id>35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chan K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0010-3853</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d523050fa25.99811188</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>566B5690-093D-4BF4-AD38-D52FA4380800</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social Inclusion and Health Conditions Among Chinese Immigrants in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom: An Exploratory Study</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Indicators Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e"><gtr:id>35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chan K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>566064c6c0a474.29127140</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8ECF8141-C222-4BE6-B84F-D3D515FED2D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Application of SCOPE-C to measure social inclusion in Hong Kong</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Community Mental Health Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e"><gtr:id>35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chan K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5464664f250477.02977038</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>672C1857-F0E1-429D-93D2-9CEAEF272CD7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relationship Between Health, Experience of Discrimination, and Social Inclusion Among Mental Health Service Users in Hong Kong</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Indicators Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e"><gtr:id>35301fe05f391b75e52c10db399cae9e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chan K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_536712730113c6ff62</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FFBE7953-8261-4CB1-8BDE-20654C337DCB</gtr:id><gtr:title>What does social inclusion mean to Singaporeans?
