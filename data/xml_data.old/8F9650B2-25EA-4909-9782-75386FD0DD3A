RCTs are increasingly seen as the gold standard for evaluating policy interventions in the UK and internationally. Given their growing importance in policy-making, the series will examine different disciplinary perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of the increased use of RCTs in policy areas including, and beyond, clinical medicine, social welfare, legal and justice services, human rights and global development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will explore the ethical challenges raised by the increased uses of RCTs in poor and middle-income nations where regulatory infrastructures often receive less investment than in northern nations such as the UK and the United States, as well as examine the industries and academic institutions that are dominant in conducting trials. Our aim is to establish cross-disciplinary dialogue on this important tool of measurement and evidence-building, examining to what extent the setting of trials - ie national, international, public or commercial - affects the robustness, access and public value of RCT results. &lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The seminar series will benefit a wide range of audiences, including government policy-makers, charitable organizations, UK and international funding organizations and think tanks. During the design of this research application, we have communicated closely with staff members and expert advisors at the WHO, Nuffield Council on Bioethics, Medical Research Council, each of whom has welcomed the initiative and agreed to attend and contribute to stakeholders events (see Case for Support).

These international groups will be kept informed of seminars outputs and discussion through regular online briefings on the seminar series' website. Travel costs have been requested to fund international collaboration and participation at targeted seminars (see Justification of Resources).

As a networking grant, the main goals were oriented at public engagement, and the main findings were a recognition of the growing interdisciplinary interest in establishing more public and scholarly forums for discussing the importance of new methodological tools for studying the impact of development policy. 

We established a popular website, www.spacesofevidence.net, and a thriving listserv serving over 100 members. We also established a Facebook page with 130+ members. A total of seven major symposiums / workshops were hosted under the auspices of the grant, in Geneva, Sussex, Essex, Durham and London, Exeter and Edinburgh. In total, 400+ attendees have benefited from the discussions at these symposiums. Currently, two of the series conveners, Dr. Ann Kelly and Dr. Linsey McGoey, are jointly editing a proposed special issue of the journal Economy and Society that features papers drawn from the series workshops. While each paper is subject to peer-review and therefore publication is not guaranteed, we have received very encouraging reviews on the submitted papers to date, and expect that publication will take place in 2018.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are keen to extend the life the Spaces of Evidence website, which is funded by the ESRC, beyond the funding period of the seminars grant which concluded in October 2016. We hope other scholars and policymakers might continue to this important initiative, and are reaching out to list members to consider longer-term funding possibilities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D6F8D968-15C1-42DC-ACB2-C1C02DFB635B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d84f33cfa890.66432417</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://spacesofevidence.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F2D08D0-A174-4A9A-AFE4-132B45CADE82</gtr:id><gtr:title>The publics of public health in Africa.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Critical public health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a5aaa4f6f268fb9856c02592768ab634"><gtr:id>a5aaa4f6f268fb9856c02592768ab634</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelly AH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0958-1596</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc9a0d64eb2.63573965</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000350/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6A8697C-69DA-4020-8D45-9901CA002827</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Global Health and Medicine</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BECA85F-CCD1-43D9-9B33-FFDFF6377498</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med Soc/Soc Health &amp; Illness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
