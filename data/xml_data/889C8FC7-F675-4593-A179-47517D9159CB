This is due to the process of transcription, where decisions get made about which of our genes actually get read and translated into active biological molecules; the proteins. For cells to develop correctly and remain healthy, it is important that the correct proteins are made, in the correct amounts, and at the correct times. If the transcription process is misregulated in some way then this can lead to disease. My research investigates how transcription is regulated within our cells, with the aim of informing strategies for tackling such diseases.

Proteins called transcription factors start transcription by binding to specific sites on the DNA (near to the genes that they control). This causes the rest of the transcriptional machinery to assemble into an enormous protein complex, and make a copy of the gene, that then gets translated to make a protein. If specific transcription factors are mutated, or present in the wrong amounts within the cell, then this can cause problems for the cell. One such transcription factor, called CREB, is found in elevated amounts in many different types of cancer cells. I am interested in finding out how CREB controls transcription, and whether we can use this knowledge to suggest ways of intervening with CREB function in cancer cells. 

CREB, like many transcription factors, does not have a well-defined shape; it is flexible, fluctuating and disordered. This is unlike most proteins, which are considered able to perform their individual jobs within the cell because of their well-defined individual shapes. Instead the disordered nature of CREB is presumed to play a functional role. I will be addressing the major question as to what this role is, and what the consequences are to the normal working of a cell if CREB is made less disordered. In particular I will be finding out if being disordered helps transcription factors like CREB find their specific DNA sites amongst the billions of bases within the cell nucleus. I will use this information to help design and test small protein-like molecules that can bind to the natural DNA sites of transcription factors. These molecules would block transcription factors binding, and therefore alter the proteins that get made in the cell. These sorts of approaches could provide a strong basis for creating drugs for cancer treatment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A significant proportion of eukaryotic proteins contain long disordered regions, but are still functional within the cell. The particular over-representation of protein disorder within transcription factors suggests an important biological role for their disorder. How functionally important protein disorder is for these critical regulatory proteins, why, and through what mechanism(s)? Several hypotheses based upon bioinformatics observations and theoretical considerations have been put forward; but most have not been tested experimentally. This project combines computational, structural, biophysical and cellular studies of a highly disordered member of the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors (bZIPs) to address this fundamental question. bZIPs are highly disordered and contain several modules that fold into alpha-helices upon binding to their partner macromolecules (DNA, other bZIP proteins, co-activator proteins) during assembly of the transcriptional apparatus. I will uncover and quantify the roles of protein disorder within the well biochemically characterised mammalian bZIP CREB. Most experimental studies focus on binding affinities of transcription factors for their isolated cognate sites, however there are reasons to think that being disordered/flexible may be advantageous in kinetic terms within the nucleus (a crowded environment with billions of base pairs of DNA). My experiments will test this hypothesis by measuring rates for 3D diffusion, 1D sliding, dissociation and intersegmental transfer separately for a characterized library of mutant transcription factors with known disorder contents. I will also quantify disorder-mediated allosteric communication between CREB modules to further understanding of transcriptional assembly. Together these mechanistic insights will be used to design peptidomimetic inhibitors of CREB, which are putative anti-cancer treatments, and will be tested on living cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Transcription is a molecular process completely essential to all life, and whose misregulation causes disease. Outside of academic beneficiaries, the results of this fundamental research project will be of interest to the biopharmaceutical industry and thus aid product development for healthcare treatments, which would eventually improve the nation's health. Routes to impact for each of these beneficiaries are described in the Pathways to Impact.

The results are likely to benefit the biopharmaceutical industry. The results may aid drug design for transcription factors, which are high-interest targets. I will uncover fundamental information regarding the order of binding events, possible allosteric sites, and importance of drug flexibility in targeting bZIP domains and/or DNA. This information could suggest new targets and/or potential approaches to drug development. More specifically results lead to starting products for therapeutic inhibitors/activators of bZIP transcription factors that are misregulated in diseases such as cancer e.g. CREB, C/EBPalpha. In addition, by describing the desirable properties for these inhibitors/activators, the project may also accelerate any product development process, thereby reducing development costs.

The results may benefit the biopharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, intracellular protein-protein interactions are very difficult to target. Peptidomimetics show a lot of promise for targeting this critical target category; they provide larger interaction areas than small molecules, but can be cell permeable. I will be producing a mutational library of peptidomimetics with deliberately designed differences in disorder content, and also assessing their cell-penetrating activity. This information could be very valuable as understanding of the properties leading to cell-penetration is still incomplete, yet this has major consequences for bioavailability of designed peptidomimetics.

The project will benefit public understanding of science. The fundamental process of transcription is described at school. I will introduce the concept of functional roles of disorder in this context (and roles of disorder in general). 

Dr Sarah Shammas will obtain project management experience during this fellowship, which will help develop her professional skills. She will also develop skills in mammalian cell culture and cellular study techniques (including qPCR and FACS). The technician will gain skills in protein expression and purification, as well as basic biophysical techniques, which are desirable in many biomedical and pharmaceutical companies. Both staff will further develop data manipulation and analysis, team building, and communication skills that are applicable in a range of work sectors outside of academic science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-08-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>972388</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36287895-36E2-4035-902D-34B4C7070AB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>pKID Binds to KIX via an Unstructured Transition State with Nonnative Interactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e92f3a6e022b940274b388f6862ab80c"><gtr:id>e92f3a6e022b940274b388f6862ab80c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dahal L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-3495</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a640169c11763.24736260</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50CF2E16-E2D6-49F5-959E-6DBAB78722B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mechanistic roles of protein disorder within transcription.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current opinion in structural biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b454c17c1389faca51068e60ccc32c64"><gtr:id>b454c17c1389faca51068e60ccc32c64</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shammas SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-440X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58aec76860cc99.89228957</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A3B23187-CC55-4A32-B7D4-B3169F058DEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phosphorylation of the IDP KID Modulates Affinity for KIX by Increasing the Lifetime of the Complex.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e92f3a6e022b940274b388f6862ab80c"><gtr:id>e92f3a6e022b940274b388f6862ab80c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dahal L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-3495</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a63fc82d57011.03934386</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N024168/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
