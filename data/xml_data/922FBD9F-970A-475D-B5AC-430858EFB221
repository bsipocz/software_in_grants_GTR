Although he wrote only 20 short stories between 1925 and 1932 before dying from TB, my study argues that his texts raise a wide range of issues that shed light upon a significant moment in Japanese history and, ultimately, add to our understanding of how modern Japanese identity developed. Although Kajii grew up in a culture strongly influenced by cosmopolitanism, by the time he started to write from the mid-1920s there was heated debate over 'legitimate' forms of literary expression. The Japanese Romantics questioned the value of a Western-inspired version of modernity; others writers were influenced by Marxism to produce Proletarian Literature; others were excited by Modernist experimentation; still others tried to create a distinctly Japanese fictional style that concentrated on first-person perspective, the so-called 'I-novel.' There was a general sense that Japanese traditional life was moribund, and Japan needed to reinvent itself. The literary argument was over what form this reinvention should take. It is precisely because Kajii draws from all these camps, but fits neatly into none, that his literature so effectively indicates a culture in crisis and transition.\nOver the last few years, I have explored modern Japanese self-identity by examining Kajii's literary articulation of boundaries between self and other, and between the human world and natural environment. I have considered how Kajii addressed aspects of his own illness and sense of impending death, and placed these concerns in a broader context; TB profoundly influenced art and culture at that time. At present, I am researching links between modernism and death. Kajii's personal experience of TB made his literature particularly sensitive to questions of life and death, but his work also addressed existentialist anxieties at a deeper cultural level. In short, his writing voiced fears that traditional culture was threatened by terminal decline, while it also sought to invigorate Japanese identity with new meaning.\nDuring the period of my Fellowship, I plan to be in Japan where I would explore further Kajii's social and literary environment by participating in a project on Japanese Modernism with Prof. Nakagawa Shigemi at Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto. This collaborative activity would allow me to research two entirely new areas. Firstly, I am interested in exploring links between literary aesthetics and a sense of destruction and decay in the broader social and political environment of the time. Various late 1920s contemporaries described a sense of crisis in the meaning of language itself, and I want to explore how this crisis might be examined through a detailed examination of Kajii's literary style. This research would require general reading into theoretical aspects of Modernism, but also some very close analyses of Kajii's use of language; Prof. Nakagawa's advice would be invaluable for this exercise. Secondly, I wish to consider the possibility that visual techniques originating from cinema, a highly popular form of entertainment in Japan by the 1920s, influenced Kajii's depictions of rural and urban scenes. I hope to demonstrate that such cinematic portrayals mirrored Kajii's real sensitivity to the highly ambiguous, fragmented and ephemeral nature of the metaphorical national landscape (that is, what it meant to be Japanese) at the time of his writing. Prof. Nakagawa's insights into Japanese Modernism would greatly help my own study.\nThis new research would consolidate my understanding of Kajii's role as an important contributor to the creation of modern Japanese identity during the late 1920s, and help significantly in bringing my book project to a successful conclusion. Moreover, by including my own translations of Kajii's work in the book, I will be introducing most of his major short stories to an English language readership for the first time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My research will have an impact in a variety of ways.\n\nIt will contribute new knowledge for comparative theoretical studies of modernism. Although scholars have begun to examine the Japanese experience from a modernist perspective, the vast majority of modernist studies so far have concerned western cultures and literatures. Among academics and others with cultural interests in the west (such as those working in museums, galleries and schools), there exists a wide general interest in Japan. My research would allow such people to become more aware of the complexities of modern Japanese society, and also make useful comparisons with literary and artistic works from the western tradition.\n\nMy research would also have a beneficial impact on modern Japanese literary studies in the west by demonstrating that Kajii was a key writer at a crucial juncture of Japanese cultural identity construction. In particular, sustained study of Japanese literature by western scholars really began only after 1945, and many new angles of research remain to be fleshed out in order to deepen our understanding of Japan and its culture. My study would help consolidate that understanding, and also help place our own interpretation of western literature and culture in a broader context.\n\nAnother way my research will have an impact is in Japan, through my scholarly contact with Ritsumeikan University, where I expect to have some influence on Japanese research training. As a foreign academic in a Japanese university, I will be able to exchange ideas and research methodologies not only with Japanese academics, but also with a new generation of graduate students emerging from Japanese institutions. This exchange will benefit both sides, but in particular I look forward to introducing young Japanese scholars to ways of seeing their own tradition from 'outside the box.' We are all, to a certain extent, trapped within the viewpoint of our own cultures, but my expectation is that my outsider perspective will encourage these young scholars to challenge preconceived notions about Japanese literature and culture.\n\nUpon my return to the UK, I will be able to share the fruits of my work with students and fellow academics at SOAS and other UK and European institutions. Since my research engages from a new angle with an ongoing academic inquiry into how Taish&amp;ocirc; (1912-1924) and early Sh&amp;ocirc;wa (1924-1932) literature articulated the struggle to formulate a modern Japanese identity, I believe my ideas will prove beneficial to academics worldwide with an interest not only in modern Japanese literature, but more generally in Japanese culture and society. The distinctive theme I have chosen, that is, using Kajii's literature as a key to understanding the 'life and death' of culture, will prove to be not only a useful and innovative way to gain a deeper understanding of a particular Japanese writer, but it will also establish a productive new interpretive angle to examine other literary works and cultures undergoing constant transformations. In addition, my translations will make Kajii's stories available for the first time to a general readership with an interest in Japanese literature.\n\nI also aim to create maximum impact with my research in a variety of other ways. I will give talks at major academic venues such as the British Association of Japanese Studies annual conference in UK, the European Association of Japanese Studies conference in various European countries, and the Association of Asian Studies conference in the USA. My research will also provide exciting new material for my talks to schoolchildren interested in Japan when they visit SOAS. In the past, I have given interviews related to Japan for BBC radio and for NHK Japanese television, and I have participated in public talks on stage at various London theatres, including the Barbican.

I took part in a group presentation at the European Association of Japanese Studies conference in Tallinn, Estonia, in August 2011. The theme of the presentation was Architecture and Literature. My own paper drew on matters that I researched during my AHRC year in Japan, related to modernism and the state of modern Japanese literature in the 1930s. I have also produced a single author book, that came out in 2014, the first book on the writer in English.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8BF50317-AB4F-4552-B152-9732656572DA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5458a1ebc45041.72329905</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My project has broadened our understanding of Kajii Motojiro's literary and cultural significance in modern Japanese literature. Since there were only a very few translations of Kajii's stories into English before my book came out, my own translations (which cover all his major short stories) now allow people for the first time to get a sense of his work, and hopefully appreciate why Kajii is a writer whose significance as an innovative and influential writer of modern Japanese literature needs to be taken more seriously. Another hope is that the quality of my translations (hopefully, good!) will stimulate other scholars in the field to apply themselves to the work of translation, a field that tends to be neglected at the present time. Because I have tried to demonstrate in my writing that Kajii should be seen as a bridge between the liberal, highly stimulating experimentation of the Taisho period when he began writing, and the early 1930s when he died, which is characterized by a more conservative shift in attitudes, I feel that my work has the potential to alert scholars to be more aware of the subtle shifts by which one cultural moment moves to another. In the last few years, some very interesting work has come out looking at both of these two moments in time, but these works do not usually consider the way one moment shifts to another. I think my own research will help scholars become aware of just how complex any shift in culture is.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My work with inspire writers to reconsider the importance of Kajii in the context of Japanese modernism during the 1920s.
