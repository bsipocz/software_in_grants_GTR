Insights from American Pragmatism</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K006185/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The four AHRC projects involved in this collaborative grant application share the view that academic theories are not ends in themselves; rather that they must serve the needs of the communities studied. Indeed many scholars have raised concerns about the gap between academic interests for advancing knowledge for knowledge sake and the practical problems and needs of the communities studied by academics (Kelemen and Bansal, 2002). 

Our collaboration is unique in that it has a dual focus on rigour and relevance and seeks to advance and promote a 'Pragmatist agenda' across the humanities, arts and social sciences. This Pragmatist agenda is rooted in the American Pragmatist philosophical school of thought represented by John Dewey, William James and Charles Peirce. Put simply, American Pragmatism may be described as a practical and anti-foundationalist philosophy that focuses on the future and is concerned with improving the conditions that enable individuals to thrive in their everyday lives. It collapses not only the artificial division between theory and practice, emphasising the link between knowledge and action, but also other restrictive dualisms (e.g. body-mind, subject-object), by a process of inquiry that understands knowledge as a practical activity and the value of theory by the practical consequences and actions it produces (Kelemen and Rumens, 2012). 

By working together with our community partners, our international academic link and his community partners, we will reflect upon as well as share our existing experiences about advancing theories that meet the dual criteria of rigour and relevance. The project will benefit greatly from a cross-disciplinary approach in terms of both content and mode of delivery. Underpinned by a Pragmatist philosophical approach, the collaboration taps into narrative methods, dramaturgical approaches, visual studies, sociological theories, design studies and community studies. Its innovative mode of delivery includes open participant sessions, drama exercises, experiential workshops, story telling, visual methods and crowd sourcing in an attempt to address issues of language translation and cultural capital across academics and community partners. 

The work of our Japanese partner which relates to and involves communities affected by the Tsunami (2011) and their way of coping with a crisis situation will benefit greatly our project by providing insights into an ongoing successful collaboration between academics and communities. Professor Kiyomiya's research focuses on what is considered 'actionable' knowledge by communities and what makes knowledge relevant, useful and/or practical at their end. We will produce two installations as a result of the workshops held in the UK and Japan that will tour various venues. The UK installation will also travel to Japan. We will disseminate our findings in conference papers and journal articles and will feed our lessons into the teaching curricula of the five universities taking part in the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Expected areas of impact are to:

1. provide best practice guidelines for academics who engage with local communities and community based organisations (CBOs);
2. contribute to local debates about regeneration by providing a forum for academics, local communities and CBOs to discuss and reflect on how they work together and how they can enhance their contribution to society;
3. contribute to public policy debates on the 'third sector' at a local, regional and national level;
4. strengthen the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom by helping communities become more self-reliant and resilient through the effective use of academic knowledge;
5. enhance the quality of life of individuals/communities by ensuring that academic research accounts for and permeates their day-to-day life;
6. develop creative outputs at the community level by promoting community engagement with academia and encouraging knowledge-sharing; 
7. evolve effective methods for capturing community level ideas and needs, to improve targeted and sustainable solution development by Not For Profit and supporting organisations;
8. improve teaching curriculum in areas such as design and innovation, third sector management, epistemology, philosophy and research methodology;
9. demonstrate the usefulness of Pragmatism as an academic paradigm that can deal successfully with the practical problems of communities. 

We will engage our beneficiaries in our project from the very beginning. We will host a two day workshop at Keele University and the New Vic Theatre. Given that participation at the workshop will be free of charge, we will attract not only established CBOs, policy makers, and academics but also career young academics, PhD students, and members of the community at large. This workshop will facilitate networking amongst different stakeholders and combine dissemination activities with more proactive aspects. Structured and improvisational activities will be used to brainstorm ideas for translating the key themes into best practice for each community group at the event. We will hold a similar event in Japan to encourage cross-fertilisation of ideas about working with communities across the two cultures. 

Our project will also help CBOs understand the potential value, costs, risks, benefits, and practicalities of working more closely with local communities and academics so that they can make informed decisions. Drawing on our local and national CBOs network, there are many groups of immediate stakeholders who will benefit from this research. Based on our existing contacts, they will include Newcastle Council for Volunteering Services, Volunteering Action Stoke-on-Trent, and Staffordshire Moorlands Council for Voluntary Service along with groups of volunteers and practitioners from the New Vic Theatre, Volunteer Experience@Keele, the Stoke-on-Trent Museums, Citizens Advice Bureau Stoke-on-Trent and ELITE (Stoke-on-Trent). 

In addition the Mondo Challenge Foundation, a charity focusing on education and livelihood development within deprived communities, will bring their expertise to explore the processes and resource options for capturing and interpreting needs and resilient community solutions. Such communities will become more self-reliant, as they can learn to identify and solve problems for themselves. 

Creative disciplines and co-design practitioners will benefit from an improved understanding amongst CBO clients, and from the guidance reporting what works and what does not work in CBOs and similar Not For Profit organisations, e.g. small charities. Our project partner, the Glass-House Community Led Design, which has significant expertise and substantial influence in its field, will be the main gateway to attracting other beneficiaries such as Nesta and Talk About Local.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41620</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This CASIC installation was part of the 'Back to the drawing board' exhibition and ran from November 23rd until January 16th. The installation contained a projection of Peter Rice's mural, Bridgewater artefacts, ordinary day to day objects, empty frames, voice overs and musical documentaries made by diverse communities which took part in previous CASIC research projects. Using Cultural Animation techniques of community engagement and knowledge co-production pioneered in the UK by Sue Moffat, Founding Director of New Vic Borderlines and developed further via the Connected Communities research, participants were encouraged to create and visualise a bright future for Stoke on Trent by filling empty frames with their own ideas and aspirations, drawing themselves in the projection, imagining conversations that will take place in the future, and writing haikus and cinquans about their aspirations, wishes and ambitions for Stoke on Trent. This living and interactive installation acted as a bridge between past, present and future and as a boundary object that can unite communities around ideas about the future.
On November, 23rd, a steady stream of community members, students and staff came to visit the CASIC installation and take part in interactive workshops. Four theatre practitioners from the New Vic Boderlines encouraged participants to paint tea towels in the Pat Albeck's tradition, write haikus about their relationship with Stoke on Trent and put themselves in the projection of a mural by Peter Rice entitled 'A Bright Past for Stoke-on-Trent'. The discussions about Stoke and its impact on one's individual and collective identity have been fascinating. The created artifacts have been added to the installation and captured in picture and video form.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F844D86-E27F-4D53-9574-E194F7B02412</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Change of views regarding the past and present of Stoke on Trent

Participants were invited to step into our specially constructed boat, listen to the recordings made at the New Vic Theatre workshop in June 2013 by the four groups and experience some of the objects (ceramics, textile, paper collages etc.) made by participants in the original workshop. 

The sails of the boat, drops of transparent materials (namely silk) had on them images of the four worlds created in the New Vic workshop: the world of coal, steel, ceramics and shipping. These worlds might have gone by now but these past worlds have taught individuals and communities to be resilient and find ways to regenerate and grow from within. The 'water world' also relates to our Japanese partner whose research revolves around the communities affected by the 2011 Tsunami (a visit is planed to this area for November 2013). We invited the participants to the CC Edinburgh showcase to jump onto the boat, make their own boats out of diverse materials (we have about 40 such little boats), learn how to crochet bridges and write their own small poems about things that have shaped their, past, present and future (about 40 poems in many languages were hung on the boat). In the background, there was a visual audio projection of the Keele University workshop. The music and light display suggested that vessels may encounter storms but they come out strongly at the other end and are able to build bridges between past, present and future, in order to get to the shore safely.</gtr:description><gtr:id>95B1C134-A6BC-466D-9828-834E52C418ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>changing perceptions of how communities deal with crisis at all levels in society</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-6447112612.842687a7170c0c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Bridging the gap: An interactive audio-visual installation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://flickr.com/gp/nishtimani/6b3HT3/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Audencia Business School</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Audencia Business School</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD7A6926-092A-4062-92E5-61D3E0D210C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>one workshop and one academic talk</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b596cc0c8868.02370126-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Mihaela Kelemen has given a talk on

Professor Hristov outlined the economic and social context of innovation, providing insightful examples of technological and social innovations that have changed the world. He stressed the need for organisations to embrace a more responsible approach to innovation that would ensure social benefits and a sustainability for future generations. The talk was followed by three cultural animation exercises run by theatre practitioners from New Vic Borderlines. Participants debated and enacted the meanings of responsible innovation, creating installations, poems and performances.

 On April 12th 2016, CASIC and the New Vic Theatre co-hosted a SEiSMiC National Workshop on 'Improving the Engagement of Public Authorities with Community Organisations'.
The event attracted over 60 participants from the UK and Holland. Academics, public authorities, funders and community partners explored how community organisations, and especially community enterprises, could work more effectively with formal (public) authorities in accessing funding, in public procurement and in conducting research and delivering innovation. The participants were divided into three groups to debate 1) accessing public funding - grants and projects, 2) public procurement and 3) being involved in research and innovation projects. The key issues identified in the morning were then animated via three experiential workshops led by theatre practitioners from the New Vic Borderlines. Participants created poems, installations and performances that were presented to the larger group. The event concluded with a presentation by Professor Kate Pahl from Sheffield University who synthesised the main communicative challenges in collaborating with multiple stakeholders and highlighted the potential of community animation techniques to surpass them, followed by a talk by Mike Coyne (SEiSMiC) who placed the findings of the workshop in a European context.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Connected Communities Festival Health in the community workshop, Keele, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE11D0C6-4A49-49FF-988A-B2A64727EC29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>More than forty participants from academia and the community took part in an interactive immersive workshop organised by the Community Animation and Social Innovation Centre (CASIC), on June 25th, 2015, as part of the Connected Communities Festival sponsored by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Participants worked collaboratively to explore what health meant for their communities and created models of ideal communities using artifacts and theatrical props provided by the New Vic Theatre. Sue Moffat and her team of theatre practitioners from the New Vic Borderlines ran a number of activities prior to the event capturing stories of health in various community venues such as schools, community centres and food banks. Parallel cultural animation activities took place on the day in Darwin Building, on the Keele grounds where a health tent was erected and in the KAVE (School of Pharmacy) where Luke Bracegirdle designed a virtual health environment. The latter incorporated findings co-produced with communities in previous research projects carried out by Mihaela Kelemen (KMS), Rajmil Fischman (Music) and Emma Surman (KMS). The workshop stimulated community-academia debate as well as personal and collective reflection on the meanings health in the diverse communities of Stoke on Trent, providing also a fertile ground for enhancing community assets and connections with academia.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b8ba7a732d57.27932073</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.keele.ac.uk/casic/connectedcommunitiesfestival/healthcommunity/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CASIC video</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5233364F-A7D0-44B7-8F07-1646C6279D1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We commissioned a short film to showcase the research done by CASIC members.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b5a04f34af61.53698064</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.moonbrushed.com/casic</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview for Cash and Culture, Nantes Radio</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>57C4E338-8E5C-4DE0-B41F-9CCD05C4E613</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://www.euradionantes.eu/article/cash-culture</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b59fb335bf86.51304379</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.euradionantes.eu/news/2017/2/6/cash-and-culture-on-the-importance-of-communities-to-cultural-entrepreneurs</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>13000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

This interactive audio-visual installation took the participants on an imaginary voyage of self-discovery, inviting them to make artefacts, write poems, record stories about matters that they or their communities might have lost and how that could feed into imagining a different future. The Bridging the Gap Installation was displayed at the Connected Communities Showcase in Edinburgh, 2013 and a podcast was commissioned by the AHRC to capture the complex process by which it had been created and re-enacted.

The Tree of Life Installation
As a symbol of longevity and endurance in Japanese mythology, the 'Tree of Life' Installation captures stories and artifacts made by Japanese communities affected by the 2011 Tsunami, in experiential workshops led by Sue Moffat, Director of New Vic Borderlines, in Minami Sanriku. The Tree of Life Interactive Installation was showcased at the Connected Communities Festival in Cardiff, 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRa71sYijxI

Blog: How can American Pragmatism support community-led design?
This Blog published on the Glass-House website was written following the event at Keele University, and aimed to disseminate both information about the project and event in the context of community led design and to pose relevant questions to the community and professional networks engaged in making physical transformations to places.
