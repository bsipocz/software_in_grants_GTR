Design</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M005771/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The primary academic design institutions in the Bristol and Bath region (UWE, and the universities of Bath Spa and Bristol) will collaborate in order to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the value and impact of design in the region. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, the team will strive to articulate the social and economic value of design, in addition to an assessment of the nature and quality of the regional design networks. Working in collaboration with REACT, West of England Design Forum (WEDF), Bristol Media, Creative Bath and The West of England Local Enterprise Partnership (WLEP), the three universities will provide a unique knowledge base that affords a deep understanding of the distinctive nature and characteristics of design in the Bristol and Bath region. The partner institutions' design academics will also exploit their networks with other regional HEIs including Bath University (Architecture &amp;amp; Engineering) and the University of Gloucestershire to provide consultative input into the project. A combination of approaches and methods drawn from both the social sciences and arts and humanities will enable the project team to move beyond the raw statistical sector mapping that has occurred to date through analysing the importance of the region's unique cultural heritage, the social, historical and cultural context within which designers operate. In this way, the project will create a robust framework for the understanding and evaluation of design in the region whose finding will benefit the research councils, the government, HEIs and industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this research project will have wide reaching benefit for the region. A fully developed profile of design industry in the region mapping how design practice enhances broad aspects of the socio-economic landscape. Its cultural and economic analysis will be of great value to our partners, funders and regional agencies. It will provide information to cover the basic gaps in available data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), which does not currently collect comprehensive data about the design industry and occupations in the widest possible sense. The project will generate robust hard factual data and case studies that will support existing anecdotal evidence. It will have the potential inform the ways in which the ONS map the SME (small and medium enterprises) element of design industry, and design roles in the 'non-creative' industries, such as engineering and aerospace. This research will enable the region's design profile and its influence to become more visible nationally and internationally. This has the capacity to attract more design and creative-led businesses and talent to the Bristol/Bath area. 
 
More widely, the impact of the project will directly support the vision and business development of the project partners and other related organisations in the region. For example, the LEP supports business growth of key sectors: creative and media (national lead); advanced engineering, aerospace and defense (national lead); micro-electronics and silicon design; environmental technologies and marine renewables; and tourism - all of which involve the design disciplines. It will also drive innovation and creativity and the development of new technologies, products and services in 3 main ways: People, Local Business and Place. LEP partners are working together to support: 95,000 new jobs by 2030; 3.4% annual growth by 2020; &amp;pound;1+ billion private sector investment over the next 3 years; well-motivated workforce with the skills business needs; an thereby provide foundations for a long-term sustainable economy. We believe that design will play a major role in the region's future development and the project will help in that process by providing accurate statistical information and a qualitative analysis of the design ecology. 
 
The project will increase regional capacity in multidisciplinary research specifically across multiple design and business disciplines through the collaborative development of the research team (Research Fellows, Associates, Administrator), providing transferable skillsets and expertise applicable to both industry and academia. The research will also produce recommendations for a 'toolkit' document that will highlight the ways in which regional economies can establish policy, investment and planning frameworks to enhance the value in their design-led creative industries. This type of shorter action-oriented publication (typically aimed at regional policy level, LEPs, local authorities, regional investment agencies) has the capacity to provide research findings during the course of the project that could enable policymakers to make a difference by describing the value of the local design communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>697844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Glenn Parry explains the role of Enterprise Imaging in the Bristol and Bath by Design research project.

The objective of the event was to gain insights as to why designers and design-led industries live and work in the Bristol and Bath region and what it really means to be here today. However, the desire to design here is not a new one and this region has been a place for making and building for centuries. Paralleling the focus of the Bristol &amp;amp; Bath by Design research project, Fa&amp;ccedil;ade and Fact: Design Cultures of Bath &amp;amp; Bristol, 1700 to the Present explored both the perceived and actual design identities of the region, as well as traced the social and cultural histories that have helped to establish Bristol and Bath as places for design and industry. 

Presentations were spread across a wide range of disciplines, subject matter and themes, all of which came together to form a picture of how and why Bath and Bristol have remained places of design, ideas and industry over the last three centuries. They raised countless questions for discussion, opening a dialogue about the future of design and creativity that is a long way from ending.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d46f27157c50.73615577</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bristolbathdesign.org/a-retrospective-view-of-facade-and-fact-design-cultures-of-bath-bristol-1700-to-the-present/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Celebrating #IDesignHere</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC6F5794-F4C5-4C03-8D5E-DFD4326061B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On July 8th, Bristol and Bath by Design and the West of England Design Forum joined forces to present #IDesignHere - an evening of talks, Pimms and live-illustration at OpenSpace.

Its aim is to give delegates a fresh, clear perspective on the current state of our creative sector, and its future. The conference attracts 200+ high-level delegates across the creative sector. Following the project launch, Bristol &amp;amp; Bath by Design was an exhibitor at Vision 2014; co-I A Noonan and project officer J Hoare were on hand to speak to delegates and distribute kits about the project.

Having ideas is easier than making them happen. The holiday event (a hygge) included speakers Katherine Jewkes - The Rooms, Ivor Williams - Humane Engineering, and Coco Sato - Giant Origami discussing design in their practices - at Loco Klub, Bristol. The Loco Klub is an old railway-workers social club that has stood empty for many years. Along with the ash pits under Temple Meads Station, the club is currently being revived and renewed by the Invisible Circus. The infamous 'Invisibles' have kindly agreed to let This Happened take over their wonderful space for one night only. As event sponsor, Bristol &amp;amp; Bath by Design researchers and co-I Noonan were on hand to talk abou the project.

A collaboration between Festival of Nature, UWE and University of Bristol, the event is part of the prestigious annual Europe-wide Researchers' Night programme. European Researchers' Night is funded by the EU Commission. The event was a huge success, in total we were joined by over 1,500 members of the public, who we hope left inspired by the fantastic research going on in their own city. Bristol &amp;amp; Bath by Design researchers designed and delivered activity engaging younger audiences and their guardians in the historical aspects of the region's design. Children were asked to surmise whether items were designed in Bristol and Bath, what if given they chance they would design and to draw their designs. This sustained activity gives our research time to talk to guardians about the research and extend the current reach of the project. It builds on our current #idesignhere engagement programme, which we have used to encourage designers to share their workspaces with us (please search for the hashtag on twitter, #idesignhere).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e00f8eba6b07.95723742</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bnhc.org.uk/bristol-bright-night/highlights-and-gallery/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>VentureFest</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CB108273-CA9B-490E-AC10-1E873AAC7E1E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UWE Exhibitor (U9), along with Bristol Robotics Lab and Research, Business &amp;amp; Innovation.

It is much more challenging to capture such value for aspects such as design (or indeed the wider creative industries or digital sectors) where, rather than a stable chain, there is an ever evolving pool of loosely connected businesses, many of whom are small, and whose relationships evolve, develop and complete in weeks and months (and perhaps a few years). We know through personal experience, anecdote and by case study that the connections to and within the design community, and corresponding research and academic communities, are vital and significant and that the reasons for their presence in Bristol and Bath are broad. However, the variety, scale of granularity and time sensitive nature of the relationships defies capture by top down methodologies developed for other sectors. In working to understand the cultural and economic value of Design, BBxD have demonstrated better evidence based methodologies and focussed on building an understanding of how the value and characteristics of these key relationships from the bottom up - not just in terms of business and economics, but by examining the interaction with wider characteristics in terms of cultural, social, geographic and historical roots.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1731ec4fe51.59611270</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1CDE7EDC-29F0-4F99-84CD-A5FD6C182C4F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bristol and Bath by Design Final Report: To understand the economic and cultural value of design in the Bristol and Bath region</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/08d31d2922cc1da20376c184004574a3"><gtr:id>08d31d2922cc1da20376c184004574a3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hughes E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b4b339454b92.08775187</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C60986E4-A812-47B3-957F-251EE25E8F35</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interim Findings</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/43d5dbaa0598ff63a555821552e9e037"><gtr:id>43d5dbaa0598ff63a555821552e9e037</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parraman C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be991acd91e5.56980767</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M005771/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A6348FE-CF33-4F09-B4DA-BA731821F803</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Product Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
