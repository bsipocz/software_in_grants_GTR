Practitioners and policy-makers in Sheffield - resulting from staff being actively encouraged to: learn about what works based on national research; reflect on the Sheffield experience of the approach; and together explore solutions to barriers to wider implementation.

Practitioners and policy-makers nationally - resulting from the sharing and promotion of the findings of this research so that practical lessons can be shared about how whole household and key worker approaches can be implemented on a city-wide scale.

Sheffield residents - in the medium-term, this work will have a wider economic and societal impact upon some of the most vulnerable people of Sheffield through improving the design and impact of services delivered by multiple public agencies; and will impact on the wider population of Sheffield as a result of reduced negative consequences such as crime and anti-social behaviour; and, through the more efficient and effective use of public funds.

It is also likely that these impacts will extend to the UK-wide population in the longer term, accruing from the impacts of the dissemination of the findings to central government, local authorities, and their service partners, through the planned national dissemination event; and through the proposed ongoing collaboration between Sheffield and other cities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88046</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project made a significant contribution to the keyworker, whole household approach in Sheffield. It has helped raise the profile of key working within the city. Sheffield City Council colleagues report (October 2014) that operational reforms continue to be developed and implemented in response to the research findings, advice and guidance:

Multi Agency Support Teams (MAST) 
The keyworker approach is mainstreamed through MAST. Reasons for underuse of MAST by some agencies were highlighted, alongside factors undercutting keyworker performance. Problem-solving workshops were facilitated with MAST senior managers and with Sheffield City Council (SCC) senior executives (chaired by Head of Children Services). Presentation of the lessons learned / areas to consider with Sheffield City Council Senior Management Team also proved beneficial, focusing discussion regarding the need for redesign of the current service structure and future service design. Family case studies highlighting benefits of early intervention and options for improving service delivery also assisted MAST.

Key Worker access to specialist support has been revisited by SCC in response to research findings; there has been an increase in the visual presence of specialists, greater publicity of specialist availability, use of team meetings / team building days to promote their expertise and what they can offer a keyworker. Promotion of good news stories from keyworkers (sharing the benefits of engaging with specialists) has enhanced casework management (by Team Managers). 

The establishment of the monthly keyworker network has facilitated the coming together of front line staff, creating a better understanding of the role of the whole family key-worker. Some services are now starting to question whether in fact their staff are actually (whole household) keyworkers!

Building Successful Families (BSF) 
BSF is SCCs project to deliver the Government's Troubled Families programme. It is committed to greater use of keyworkers and a whole household approach. The project team worked closely with BSF via regular briefings to BSF's leadership team and a lead role in BSF stakeholder seminars. 

The issue of how SCC defines the difference / commonality between Keyworkers and Lead Professionals has been explored further following questions raised by the research and SCC are in the process of seeking to establish a common understanding within both the BSF principles of the 'way of working' and through the update of the Integrated Practice Manual (which in turn incorporates guidance on the FCAF/ TAF process which we will be driving forward as a citywide multi-agency approach for the assessment and support of families). Research findings have also informed the development of a 'standards framework' for commissioned services, which seeks to ensure that whole household and keyworker principles are embedded in BSF delivery.

BSF specialists have concentrated on the embedding of the role of the whole family key worker and whole household working within the BSF programme, championing the benefits of the approach, this has had an enormous impact on adoption of the role and the understanding of what this means.

Research findings have been central to ongoing discussions regarding service transformation and development for Phase 2 of the city's Troubled Families (BSF) programme. The focus of attention has been on addressing the capacity of whole family keyworkers, an issue raised by the research, and recognising that this resource needs tailoring (rather than standardising) to best meet the variety and complexity of needs within families.

The findings have helped with the development of the Building Successful Families Standards Framework, established with key partners and support services to reinforce good practice. The framework set outs what we mean by key working and whole household. We have contracted with organisations to provide whole household keyworkers, contracts are being monitored to ensure they are delivering using whole household and key-worker principles and ethos set out in the framework.

Prevention and Assessment Teams (PAT) and Family Common Assessment Framework (FCAF) 
PAT are multi-agency partnerships providing a single 'front door' into services for children and families. SCC is also developing an assessment tool to replace the CAF, which promotes a whole household assessment and intervention approach. PAT and FCAF are in development and offer solutions to issues raised by this project: improving information sharing and decision-making; increasing the speed/accuracy of case allocation; clearer demarcation of roles and responsibilities between services; promoting multi-agency assessments; and providing a central referral point for partners, such as GPs and Children's Centres.

Understanding the costs and benefits of key working
Qualitative insights into costs and benefits complemented quantitative data collected by SCC and fed into ongoing efforts to include local costs and benefits in the national calculator designed by DfE. The viability and practicalities of collaborative funding arrangements for key working were also explored and potential barriers identified. 


Statement of local impacts from Sheffield City Council ( from 2013):
Sheffield City Council is committed to making greater and better use of keyworkers to support vulnerable families and individuals. We already use keyworkers in Sheffield, and we are scaling up these approaches through internal services and investments in partners.

Sheffield Hallam University's work has made a significant contribution to our understanding of how these approaches are working, and what we can do to help keyworkers be even more effective. The SHU team have built up an in-depth knowledge about the successes and challenges of these ways of working, through discussions across the breadth of Sheffield City Council and beyond, and deep into the organisation. They have spoken to Directors and senior managers within Sheffield City Council and partners organisations, interim-level managers, front-line staff and families. This has enabled the team to really explore some of the challenges that present themselves when rolling out new and ambitious ways of working, at a time when public budgets are reducing and under significant pressures.

There has been a strong knowledge transfer element to the work: the team have shared their findings with relevant people along the way with an honesty and diplomacy that has meant findings have been recognised and accepted. Their work has endorsed many of the improvements that are already in train; some improvements have been implemented as a result of the research itself; and the work has helped to clarify additional improvements that we need to make in order to further improve how we support families in need of extra help and support.

Achieving this requires significant organisational change for SCC and its partner services. This knowledge exchange project promoted a city-wide understanding of the 'whole household' and 'keyworker' approach. By developing a deep understanding of local context and juxtaposing this with national evidence. It also generated a framework to support improvements in the on-going development of the approach across the city.

The project involved three strands of work: engagement with policymakers and practitioners to understand local opportunities and challenges; case study work with families to understand experiences and outcomes associated with keyworker interventions; and support and advice to SCC and its partners via workshops, meetings and reports.

These activities revealed the challenges involved in maximising the benefits of the keyworker, whole household approach, identified priorities for action and generated workable solutions. Findings supported the production of a 'standards framework' to guide the effective operationalisation of SCC's strategic vision. Findings also supported the development of a multi-agency referral system for prevention and intervention work with households, and informed the development of the Family Common Assessment Framework (FCAF), which is currently being trialled in the city.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Impacts within Sheffield were furthered following the completion of the project in 2013 by a presentation of findings to the SCC Executive and the testing of solutions with service directors. Resulting improvements have helped: the city's vulnerable families; ensure more effective use of public funding; enhance efforts to tackle crime, anti-social behaviour and worklessness.

The project team maximised impacts on national policy and practice following the completion of the project through a briefing session with the DCLG Troubled Families team in November 2013, exploring barriers to upscaling whole household approaches.
