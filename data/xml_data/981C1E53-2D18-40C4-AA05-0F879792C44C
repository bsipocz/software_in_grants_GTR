Often, policy makers, practitioners and researchers have identified simple innovations and investment opportunities that would greatly improve productivity and offer a substantial rate of return but yet do not get adopted. The aim of this research is to identify imperfections and frictions that prevent the adoption of profitable technology and innovations or, more generally, that may impede investment opportunities with a potentially high rate of return.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />&lt;br />To achieve this, the research will use data that have been collected to evaluate a number of interventions in developing countries in order to estimate models of individual behaviour and investment choices. There will be four different projects, covering parts of Africa, India, and Pakistan. The use of different methods, ranging from impact evaluation to the estimation of economic (structural) models of behaviour will allow one to understand the mechanisms at play, and also for the extrapolation of what is learnt in a given context to a variety of different situations. This research is crucial for the design of policies aimed at improving productivity.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>First and foremost, we believe that our proposed research project will have a direct impact on the institutions, policy makers and funders involved in the specific interventions that will be the object of this study. Results of this research will help the implementing institutions to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of outcomes achieved through their interventions. This knowledge will be of importance for improvements in their intervention delivery strategy as well as for advocacy purposes. Also policy makers and funders directly involved in the projects will be able to feed our research outputs into general awareness creation and policy making with the aim of enhancing productivity in developing countries. Specifically, the main directly involved institutions are: The Government of Punjab through their Punjab Economic Opportunities Program (PEOP), the Indian microfinance institution BASIX India, the Ethiopian NGO International Development Enterprises (IDE), the Indian FINISH Society and its implementing partners (currently seven microfinance institutions), the Dutch NGO Waste, the Mai Mwana Project in Malawi, a collaboration between Kamuzu Central Hospital Department of Pediatrics, Mchinji District Hospital, and the UCL Centre for International Health and Development at the Institute of Child Health; on the funders side there is additionally DfID, ESRC, the Dutch Government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DGIS) and other stakeholders include Hewlett Packard, SNS Real, TATA-AIG Life Insurance, etc.. To achieve our aim of supporting their work with our research findings, we put emphasize on involving relevant actors in project design decisions and see regular communication through in-person meetings and discussion, workshops as well as simply through email and on the phone a key aspects of our work. We will also publicize our work not only in academic journals but project reports and summary documents accessible to those directly involved as well as to the general public free of charge.
In addition to actors directly involved, the research can be of important use to institutions and policy makers working in similar areas. To reach this audience, we will draw on the wide network that members of the research team have built up over the years, to organise workshops and seminars specifically targeted at policy makers and practitioners, including International Organisations staff. We will also engage in one-to-one meetings with staff of institutions such as the World Bank. We will also continue to actively participate in networks such as the International Growth Centre (IGC), which is explicitly designed to draw together policy makers and academics. Besides publishing findings in the form of reports and academic papers in peer-reviewed journals, as mentioned above, we further plan to ensure that our findings are published in local and international newspapers. 
We also expect impacts through the project implementation rather than through then project's findings. This is will be achieved primarily through capacity building of the implementing institutions as well as research partners in the project countries. Staff of implementing institutions is closely involved in every stage of the evaluation designs such as: defining survey instruments, which include the key outcome variables and the variables on intermediate outcomes that help pin down mechanisms underlying the main outcomes and developing the treatment designs. Most of the projects hire and/or involve local field staff in all aspects of the intervention and evaluation, so that at the end of the project they will be in a strong position to design and implement further evaluations. As mentioned above, we aim to stay in close contacts with the institutions also beyond the project, so that also input or support can be provided on such issues if need arises.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>309440</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>No toilet, no bride: The unlikely link between private toilets and marriage market outcomes in India</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29F9B6E0-04B9-4BB5-A388-BF956AACCF39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A blog piece by Britta Augsburg and Paul Rodr&amp;iacute;guez Lesmes was published on South Asio @LSE and IGC.

Study findings were presented at seminars and conferences to ensure academic integrity of the analysis and interpretation of results. Examples of seinars and conferences attended include among other the 10th Annual Conference on Economic Growth and Development (Delhi, December 2014), Royal Economic Society Conference (Manchester, April 2015), Econometric Society World Congress (Montreal, August 2015), European Economic Association Meetings (Mannheim, August 2015). These findings are then written up in working papers to be submitted in top academic journals and summarized in policy briefs and blogs. Outcomes of this grant are in different stages of this process, with some being under review at for example the Economic Journal and the Journal of Economic Development and Cultural Change. In parallel, we have now started to disseminate the findings to wider audiences through policy briefs, blogs, stakeholder engagement and also our end of grant conference which took place in July 2015 and brought together researchers from around the world, while keeping a policy angel, with for example Stefan Dercon, the Chief Economist of DfID as one of the keynote speakers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FC5BDA24-0AD5-459D-BF4D-4A0DC02DBAED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>565c509abe2c44.23842037</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant pooled together work of independent and distinct projects, linking them under one common theme, namely that of constraints to productivity. Each project made independently important strides during the period of this grant, producing evidence to answer stated research objectives. Some of the new evidence that comes out of this grant includes: (i) Relatives, grandmothers in particular, can play an important role in shaping responses to an information campaign targeting infant health. In order to increase the impact of information campaigns, our findings suggest that excluding influential older women can weaken intervention impact by exposing a divergence between traditional views and new information; (ii) A further important contextual factor in improving children's health is that of sanitation. Our research demonstrates a link between increased sanitation coverage in the child's environment and its health status, which has so far proven difficult to rigorously establish; (iii) evidence such as that linking sanitation and child health calls for programs that increase sanitation uptake. Our research suggests that credit constraints might not be a key barrier to adopting sanitation, despite households reporting the same. Our evaluation of an intervention providing credit for sanitation does not lead to an increase in the adoption of this technology (despite credit uptake); (iv) we conduct a cost-benefit analysis of owning livestock, particularly cattle. The findings feed into a recent debate on why people invest in livestock (some arguing that it is not rational given no/low returns), stressing the importance of considering variations in returns over time.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be particularly useful for policy makers and implementing NGOs. For example, findings from Malawi can be used by agencies working on child health and nutrition campaigns in developing countries, findings from India can be taken up by government officials and other stakeholders as backing evidence for the importance of pushing improvements in sanitation, and findings from Pakistan (not yet finalized at this stage) will be useful for government and donor funded programs aimed at improving livelihoods for the poor in Punjab, Pakistan as well as those wanting to learn about asset transfer programs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>75C1AB14-6911-4E7C-B87B-9EDAE8A0A7EF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>565b1bdc6fa0e2.34893465</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FA4982D-F850-4475-94D3-D1253AF32E9A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Financing household sanitation through microfinance - impacts and challenges</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03"><gtr:id>e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Britta Augsburg</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>565da22a89db90.11350597</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>37028FB1-A6D1-4A72-9BD6-8A0C1C3B74F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Livestock asset transfers with and without training: Evidence from Rwanda</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/97963bacfb45778924b6f177f53b7ce8"><gtr:id>97963bacfb45778924b6f177f53b7ce8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Argent J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>565c832d5eae14.57724128</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0CF4D9D4-D730-4CEC-A7C2-5AB9F4E27D05</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sanitation and Child Health in India</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03"><gtr:id>e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Britta Augsburg</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>565d8d3d5b4b19.53712595</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B5119731-E13A-46BA-8357-3C71FC9AD450</gtr:id><gtr:title>The performance of Microfinance-Plus in times of Crisis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03"><gtr:id>e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Britta Augsburg</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>565da274048775.44528118</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>238D27C6-AE19-498D-BB44-6FB5AC65DB37</gtr:id><gtr:title>Holy Cows or Cash Cows?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1bf77d4ebfad8b2982e8b253ebd671c5"><gtr:id>1bf77d4ebfad8b2982e8b253ebd671c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Attanasio O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>565d9cd039cdf3.73183635</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>70208039-3AB7-4939-81D5-1F7FD98F5B2D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sanitation (and research) dynamics - a research agenda on sanitation and primary data collection</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03"><gtr:id>e11284178808ecc4af817db755f56a03</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Britta Augsburg</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>565d8c8728d996.44872641</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>98260D8A-50D4-4A48-8FF7-B12831FB4B71</gtr:id><gtr:title>Subjective Expectations and Income Processes in Rural India</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Economica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1bf77d4ebfad8b2982e8b253ebd671c5"><gtr:id>1bf77d4ebfad8b2982e8b253ebd671c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Attanasio O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>565d8bf7531552.50175269</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6910CD8C-E9C8-469C-8752-9DA6CE016EB2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Holy Cows or Cash Cows?
