and around the world. The UK House of Commons Health Select Committee calculated that in 2002 clinical obesity cost
the English economy somewhere between &amp;pound;3.3-3.7 billion per annum. A similar calculation in 2006 by the EU commission
estimated that between 59 billion Euros and 236 billion Euros per annum or 7-28% of the total healthcare budget of the
member states was spent on the consequences of obesity related illness. It is estimated that by 2050 obesity will affect
60% of the UK population. If this problem is not addressed it will result in an unprecedented and possibly unsustainable
drain on healthcare resources in the UK. Tackling this huge problem will require a multi faceted approach, not least of
which will be attempts to modify the eating behaviour of large parts of the population. Food manufacturers have been
proactive in this respect by developing a range of low or reduced fat foods to replace less healthy alternatives. However,
reduced fat foods at present have low uptake by consumers and make little profit for industry. Market studies show that
consumers will not choose healthier food and drink products that have inferior taste or mouth feel to the less healthy
equivalent. In this study we aim to develop protein-based ingredients and enabling technologies for the formulation of foods
with reduced energy density while providing stability and mouth feel that are equivalent or improved compared to the
original versions. We will use a multi-scale approach that aims both to understand the microscopic role played by novel fat
replacers and emulsifiers, how these will impact on structure at the colloidal level, and how this determines texture in the
whole food. This will allow us to broaden our specific approach into a general strategy that can be applied to a wider range
of food products</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ability to formulate and manufacture foods with a reduced energy density, which at the same time have sensory

Academic Beneficiaries
Describe who will benefit from the research [up to 4000 chars].
social and health benefits to the UK as a whole. Also, development of underpinning technology to facilitate production of
functional fat replacer ingredients would place the two academic partners at the forefront of the application of fundamental
research concepts to the intelligent design of food protein ingredients.
We have identified a number of benefits from this research that would impact on the partner organisations, the food
industry and society as a whole.
Economic: supply of commercially valuable protein prototypes from 2nd year of project resulting in potential additional
annual income stream building up to at least &amp;pound;400 million at (&amp;pound;1000/ton) (estimated by Premier Foods). Premier Foods,
Marlow Foods, Hlere and Mantons's will extend their product range during and after completion of the project. All partners
estimate that this will benefit them for at least 10 years after product launch. Nandi Proteins and Wright Agri Industry Ltd.
will benefit for at least 10 years after completion of the project by licensing fees and royalties.
Technical: new processes and products will be generated and patented. New methods for studying the formation of
structure in reduced fat products will be developed and applied to relevant systems. Agreement of all consortium members
will be sought prior to publication of the fundamental aspects of the project, to avoid jeopardizing granting of patents on
novel technologies and products arising from the project.
Environmental: reducing waste from food manufacturing plants andransforming waste into high value ingredients. We will
look at the modification of functional properties of food grade proteins that have traditionally been thought of as waste,
including pot ale or spent grain in brewing/distilling and a mycoprotein rich waste stream from Quorn manufacture (Marlow
Foods) that has already shown promise as a foaming ingredient. The technology to turn these in to useful functional food
proteins would demonstrate that so-called waste proteins can be converted to economically viable products, which would
open up the opportunity to apply the technology to other waste protein streams.
Social: the project will contribute to improve quality of life by reducing obesity of consumers which will come to effect within
1 year of completion of the project and will last as long as the novel ingredients and products are on the market. This is
potentially the most important impact of all given the huge economic cost to the UK of obesity related illness. We recognise
that the contributory factors for obesity are many and complex, and that overeating/eating energy rich foods is only one of
them. However, the manufacture of reduced energy density foods that look, taste and have the same texture as the higher
energy density equivalents could have a signiifcant impact on the problem.
Collaborative: the collaborative nature of the project will provide benefits to all partners. Industrial partners will gain access
to equipment and expertise which is generally not available within their own organisations. This will be of particular benefit
to the SME members of the consortium. Similarly, at a time of economic downturn when research budgets are tight, the
larger companies will gain access to highly innovative and novel ideas generated by the Universities and SME's. The
collaboration between HWU and UoE is in the spirit of the Scottish Universities Industry Innovation Network for Food and
Drink research pooling project, and will help establish Edinburgh as a major Scottish and UK centre for food research in
this area, and should lead to many years of collaborative food research outwith the current project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189963</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>951CCFA8-BD2E-4462-A050-00CE32629F36</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The release was picked up by several national news papers and reported on websites with international reach

In particular we want to find ways to improve or change the performance of these proteins so that they can be used in lower concentrations which give a cost saving to the manufacturer, or impart new properties such as fat replacement. A number of proteins have been investigated which have either been modified using a process that alters their structure in a controlled way, or which have been derived from an unusual source such as the waste by-product stream from another food manufacturing process. The proteins studied are, milk whey proteins, skim milk proteins, milk protein concentrate, egg proteins (whole egg, egg yolk and egg white), a protein containing waste stream from a fungal food product manufacturing process. Improvements in the functional properties are achieved by modification of the proteins using two patented processes provided by Nandi Proteins, one of the industrial collaborators. These involve either a partial denaturation and controlled aggregation of the proteins, or a controlled reaction between protein and sugars to form a protein-oligosaccharide conjugate.

Finding from the project to date include,

. partially denatured milk proteins can be used as fat replacers/mimetics
? partially denatured milk whey proteins can be used to partially replace egg protein in model systems without significant loss of functionality. Mixtures of 50% egg and 50% whey protein show the same emulsifying ability, foaming ability and gelation characteristics as are found with 100% egg protein. This opens up the possibility of using partially denatured whey protein as an egg replacer. One problem facing food manufacturers is the increasing cost of egg protein ingredients, which are used as binding agents in many foods due to their gelling properties.

? conjugation of milk proteins with galacto-oligosaccharide improves the foaming and emulsifying ability of skim milk powder, and to a lesser degree milk protein concentrate, but has no effect on whey protein concentrate. 

? We have isolated and purified a fungal protein stream that has extremely high emulsifying ability. 

Ultra-filtration was carried out on the crude fungal protein waste stream to separate high and low molecular weight (MW) proteins and concentrate these protein fractions on a laboratory scale. The fungal biomass containing fermenter broth was centrifuged to analyse both its supernatant and cell fractions. 
Foaming, emulsifying and rheological properties (viscosity, gelation) were assessed using a range of techniques on the broth and centrate samples. In parallel the protein composition of the samples was analysed by proteomics (LC/MSMS) and SDS/Native-PAGE. A commercial whey protein concentrate (WPC) product was used as control.

? The broth deposit and high MW waste fraction showed outstanding foaming stability in comparison with the WPC control and other samples.
? Emulsions stabilised with the high MW waste fraction displayed lower oil droplet sizes and higher stability than the control and other samples.
? Solutions and oil emulsions of high MW waste fraction showed higher viscosities than the WPC control and other samples.
? The high MW waste fraction displayed a lower gelation point than the WPC control and its gel showed a higher visco-elasticity profile than the control and other samples.
? Proteomic and electrophoretic analyses revealed a concentration of surfactant-like proteins in the functional fraction .

Overall these results highlighted the functional potential of the fermented broth and waste co-product, which could result from the presence of aggregated functional proteins and/or functionality imparted by the fungal cells themselves. 
Following this initial study the consortium is now interested in assessing the feasibility of producing and extracting functional mycoprotein on a large scale for use as functional ingredient (fat replacer, animal protein replacer) in innovative food products.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Partially denatured proteins - work relating to the partial denaturation process in general will be exploited in collaboration with Nandi Proteins. We have recently been awarded a KTP project to investigate further the link between partially denatured protein structure and functional properties, with the aim of understanding in more detail how processing can be used to control the functional properties of these proteins. 
As a result of the expertise we have gained in waste protein utilization, we have been awarded a second KTP project with a major food manufacturer in Scotland to develop protein mimetics for replacement of key ingredients in their food formulations.
Egg protein-milk protein mixtures - work continues on this. Exploitation will be in collaboration with Wright-Agri and an industrial collaborators on this project.

Fungal Protein products - work continues on this. Exploitation of this work will be in collaboration with the company supplying the waste stream. The company view development of protein products from their waste stream as a longer term goal. To this end we have applied for and been awarded two Innovate UK grants to follow up the separation and exploitation of the fungal proteins. One is funded through the Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst, the second through the sustainable supply chain management call. The IB catalyst grant will further explore the potential of fungal proteins as food ingredients, by following changes in the proteome of the waste stream throughout the course of a 32 day fermentation cycle. This will help to identify when particular proteins are expressed by the organism, and how this impacts on the functional properties as food ingredients. In parallel to this, we will also work to identify the optimum separation process for the proteins in the waste stream. In the second IUK project, which will follow on from the IB catalyst project, we will scale up the separation and purification of the fungal proteins to produce 100g-kg quantities and these will be tested for functionality in the products of the industrial collaborators. If successful, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of extracting and exploiting valuable protein from the fungal process waste stream (currently approx. 500000 cubic meters per year).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>96849246-6D05-47D7-B737-A7C52EB08384</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3025285250.5308437774cb9b0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/greattastinglowfatcheesesandcakes/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8150772B-6D5A-44A2-991A-B9938A473C5A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The major proteins of the seed of the fruit of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.): Characterisation and emulsifying properties.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1c89f73f505e99ecf0bee1bb853b85a5"><gtr:id>1c89f73f505e99ecf0bee1bb853b85a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Akasha I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0308-8146</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56b0838d107d64.72032359</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2B7C4AE2-E942-4441-B7A6-09432F1C4B89</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electrostatic complexes of whey protein and pectin as foaming and emulsifying agents</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Food Properties</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/735e1f7ac101d1276c28d7b664f78863"><gtr:id>735e1f7ac101d1276c28d7b664f78863</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oduse K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>15322386 10942912</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9583ed29e520.55822072</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8DBE8F0C-6752-4014-A9CE-F87736E1E80C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Properties of partially denatured whey protein products 2: Solution flow properties</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food Hydrocolloids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0355658aee7a567caa922e6adbda88b6"><gtr:id>0355658aee7a567caa922e6adbda88b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b0a4568c1770.19567360</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>19360850-F722-464E-87D3-0C17538866CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Properties of partially denatured whey protein products: Formation and characterisation of structure</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food Hydrocolloids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0355658aee7a567caa922e6adbda88b6"><gtr:id>0355658aee7a567caa922e6adbda88b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0268-005X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>589b4edd7a1795.12986799</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J501682/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>67</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9767B5B6-94F7-4DF6-8415-C15629D67796</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complex fluids &amp; soft solids</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E4D49DD8-E515-4246-8886-C9E048C0E565</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rheology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
