It does so through two exploratory field visits and two subsequent collaborative pilot research periods. These pilots integrate a baseline geo-mapping survey with worker interviews to explore the implications of ethanol production in north England (from corn) and south Goias (from sugarcane) for the availability and quality of work, of water and of land for food production. These sites are of local, regional and global economic and environmental significance. Secondly, two component case studies of local, participative and potentially socially, environmentally and financially sustainable approaches to food and energy production will be drawn from coastal Scotland and south Goias. These activities form the basis for two complimentary workshops, with a focus on policy and technical innovation towards enhanced social and environmental futures for food and energy production and three structured meetings between partners, senior institutional staff and students to establish and resource an enduring, interdisciplinary research agenda and collaborative postgraduate training. The process will be filmed as part of project learning and dissemination. The project stages are set out below alongside the name of the individual applicant with responsibility for each.
Rationale: BP investment in agrofuel in UK and Brazil typifies recent market diversification by hydrocarbon/0etrochemical majors, and the issues regarding designated technologies: further market capture and concentration may have implications for work and natural resource allocation, while the socio and bio-diverse impacts of food conversion to energy crops remain under analysed. Secondly, Scotland's impressive record as an EU leader in renewable energy and stated aim to attain energy self-sufficiency from renewable resources by 2020 rests heavily on wind and water. Resource scarcity has forced islanders into innovating and maintaining community owned, sustainable energy alternatives leading to repopulation. Furthermore, in its coastal, rural areas short supply chains and low tillage have been among distinct and instructive survival and policy strategies of small farmers and their associations. 
Activity: Three day Spring school on 'human and physical resources in the production of renewable energy' with UFG visitors, staff and students of Dept CEE, Dept HRM, Technology and Innovation Centre, existing research partners from Poland and Hungary and stakeholders from public, commercial and social sectors. (E Joao and P Stewart)
Activity -Formal partner meeting
Activity- Pilot Research period 1. Two Postgraduate researchers (CEE and HRM) and one from UFG accompanied by Brian Garvey (HRM). Scoping research that geo-maps the physical influence of ethanol production on land and water use in Hull, provides for preliminary interviews with workers in the sector. Case study development of sustainable food and energy production in coastal Scotland based on community interviews. (B Garvey)

Stage 2 Brazil
Activity - Stewart, Jo&amp;atilde;o, Garvey and postgraduate researcher in UFG. Field visits to south Goias expansion of agrofuel production for national and EU market.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The UK-Goias link provides an opportunity of scoping research with international strategic relevance for future food and energy innovation. UK is faced with a diverse range of possible energy technologies; Scotland seeks to be 100% self-sufficient on renewable energy by 2020. Since Kyoto protocol introduced mandates for lower carbon emissions in EU countries, Brazil has boasted the world's first integrated energy matrix and has been a key source of both biofuels for the global market and a key site for investment by oil and food majors. Between low carbon policy and newly emerging agroenergy commodity production, however, exist more localised and potentially sustainable alternatives that suggest that quality at work and environmental sustainability may be further enhanced through promoting the development and transfer of socially orientated technologies and policy agendas. 


By engaging scientists across disciplines in key sites of production of emerging energy forms in UK and Brazil we seek to better quantify the opportunities, or indeed risks, for dwellers in these local (rural) areas, their integration or exclusion from developments and question the evident asymmetry between the transnational political influence of industrial leaders of new innovations and the communities relying on land and water in these regions. We wish to establish a collaborative methodology across sciences in UK and Brazil in this exploratory project towards future solution based policy and technical innovation that enhances inclusive, financially, environmentally and socially viable strategies for energy and food production alongside stakeholders whose welfare, income and security are closely linked to the questions of research.

The research will strengthen international partnerships between researchers and institutes involved, open the possibility to exchange researchers and undergraduate and postgraduate students and co-develop programmes of common interest and transnational relevance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47834</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a 193 minute film made in Scotland and Brazil as party of the Newton Fund that brings industry, community and labour perspectives on new energy forms, impacts on food production and work</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D52F8E4-C03D-4272-8795-C4B587D6491F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>a screening schedule is planned for spring to academic and non academic audiences</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6b0d58bba3.09840482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Land: a labour of life</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://youtu.be/Zqnj3KDdNl0</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Vi?osa</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Newton Fund UK Brazil Research Strathclyde Goias</gtr:description><gtr:id>72DF5427-EB17-4CB2-A11F-FBA4A98014D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-hosting international workshops and seminars in UK and Brazil Successive, successful joint funding applications to ESRC, British Council, FAPEG, CONFAP Newton Fund, EPSRC, Scottish Insight.

The interdisciplinary 
This solution-orientated workshop invited forward looking contributions from academics, students, workers, community activists and trade unionists from Brazil, Scotland, UK and broader Europe as part of a project entitled 'Challenges and Futures for new technologies' funded by Newton Fund RCUK/CONFAP with further support from the Knowledge Exchange Development Fund of University of Strathclyde and EU Marie Curie Changing Employment Initial Training Network. By exploring social, policy and technological innovation that takes account of contemporary power inequalities in natural resource access, food and energy production the workshop sought to found further research, linked to practical implementation of participative, socially and ecologically committed forms of food with energy production.

Each presenter was requested to present in plain language for a non specialist audience. Explaining contemporary situations and challenges under each theme was important but we asked that each presenter concludes by suggesting practical ways that her or his research can contribute to seeking solutions through collaboration across disciplines and borders. 

The workshop concluded with commitment to collaborate on a three year research agenda between UKand Brazil and seek funding for this. One subsequent Newton Fund application was unsuccessful and a second proposal was successful. The Stathclyde social, business, healyh and engineering scientists are now embarking on a collaborative project on work, land contamination and hydro energy as a result of the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd8191d184b4.46905881</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.workandglobalisation.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Findhorn workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>606CE578-4D06-41F8-8DF8-149FAF515D0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Strathclyde research team for the Newton Fund were invited to co-organise, present and participate in a 'Harnessing Community Energy' conference at the ecovillage, Findhorn, a home of various sustainable food, energy and architecture solutions.

Challenges
- The absolute priority placed on cutting costs by major agroenergy and food corporations (often in breach of law) tied to intense market compromises longer term social and environmental security
- Social conflicts are increasing over access to land and water as result of large dam and plantation constructions, contamination from industrial chemicals, and structural unemployment 
-A lack of regular, independent monitoring of surface and ground water, soil and labour utilisation and quality in new energy frontiers compromises claims of corporate responsibility linked to market certification
-Policy at national and international level continues to support larger commercial interests than smaller producers of food and energy in Scotland or Brazil
-new systems of food and energy production must be economically attractive to the relevant communities


Future opportunities for research and impact
-New energy technologies such as solar, hydro, biomass and organic residues do offer potential for social and ecological improvements in rural areas of study
- The cost of new technologies and their implementation, training and maintenance do require further political will and investment
-Projects that are designed with appropriate scale, community involvement and integrated energy sources can lead to social and economic benefits and justice that are less reliant on or independent of fossil fuel energy networks 
- More rigorous monitoring of direct and indirect implications of new energy technologies on water and land quality and use and adherence to national labour laws is required
- There is a strong potential for further exchange of experiences and practices between Brazil and Scotland. This is particularly regarding community participation in small scale sustainable energy systems in Scotland, and successful seed storage, co-operative and locally networked forms of food production linked to traditional and agrarian reform settlements in Brazil
-The interlinkages between energy extraction and use, the quality and health of labour and dependency on soil and water resources for future sustainability demand further interdisciplinary approaches to research and development, monitoring, assessment and evaluation of existing and alternative technologies</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Community scale renewable and sustainable energy system examples demonstrated by the research have enabled specific Scottish communities to establish themselves as places for academic study and eco-tourism providing a boost to their local economic situation; however, these are not yet fully developed to cover all energy demands. Current engineering design process covers financial, energy and possibly carbon, there is also occasionally an environmental impact assessment, there is however no design process which captures the required multi-criteria sustainability assessment including society, work, water, environment, ecology, health etc. to support balanced decision making on future strategy. Such assessment methods are currently unavailable and should be developed and piloted in the Brazil and Scotland focus locations.
Opportunities: The opportunity exists to develop energy and sustainability assessment and design methods. These could then be applied to develop future roadmaps for the Scottish Communities (Islands and Grid Connected) already at the energy frontier.
Other Communities aspiring to become energy independent and have local sustainable systems (e.g. Kinlochleven) can then also be supported with multi-faceted sustainability assessment methods used in planning and design of appropriate local energy systems.
The development of similar initiatives for Rural Workers Temporary Camps and Permanent Settlements in Brazil incorporating the use of multi criteria assessment methods in design and implementation of local energy systems can give potential for local employment and economic benefits as seen in Scotland. For temporary settlements (and possibly also more permanent locations) there would appear to be an opportunity to develop a modular portable renewable energy system in a box. This could be expanded to provide additional social facilities. 
Whether in Scotland or Brazil, the costs involved remain problematic in the absence of greater resource availability linked to policy change towards the realisation of these solutions. The indirect value associated with social benefits of local renewable systems needs to be accounted for. 
First, the dire link between water and agriculture translates to concerns about water quality and quantity due to activities such as sugarcane biofuel, cotton and soy production. Agriculture requires vast amounts of water and the pesticides and fertilisers used for this activity pose a risk to the quality of water resources. Future research can explore this area and collect quantifiable data in the realms of water quality and quantity.
In some areas of the state of Goi&amp;aacute;s, there are concerns about energy generation through small scale hydroelectric plants. Future research can investigate the dynamics of the industry in the area and specifically identify the latent water conflicts that can potentially emerge. Special emphasis should be given to the environmental impact assessments (EIA) done prior to the construction of these plants.
Water is essential for people's livelihoods. During the exploratory fieldwork some issues regarding water access and sanitation were identified. Further research is needed in order to identify and bridge the gaps in this realm. Future efforts should take into account the socio-economic dynamics of rural communities and identify possible solutions for enhancing people's livelihoods through the provision of clean water in adequate quantities.
To conclude, future research needs to investigate how to enhance data monitoring with regards of water quality and quantity. There is a clear need from both the civil society and environmental authorities to work in this direction. The lack of data introduces a level of uncertainty on all the identified water conflicts and issues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EA136205-9D99-4EBA-8E5D-8A57FF5B0661</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd8c9ebf1fc0.55729124</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.workandglobalisation.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Statement to committee for the international certficiation of sugar and ethanol trade, BONSUCRO</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>11224303-36AF-4B2D-BF8D-D3B2902D94F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df0540d65b84.68112491</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Public Policy, Territory and Labour</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E949F423-ACF1-4A17-96C2-D33E6C8C2CFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A significant impact of this group to date has been the securing of food banks in rural communities of Goias, a practice that, with statutory support has grown exponentially in terms of families involved, greatly enhancing local food and livelihood security.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df0418a4d4b7.05328861</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://laboter.iesa.ufg.br/p/3464-nucleos-e-linhas-de-pesquisas</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Using the Laboter digitial laboratory of our collaborators Federal University of Goias, the project created maps of sugarcane expansion between 2006 and 2014 in the SW Goias region of study and the relation to water courses and native habitat
