The aim was to give insight into one computer science career as well as insight into why some interactive computer systems are easier to use than others. The workshop demonstrated in a hands-on way that computer science is not just about using computers, but about understanding computation, people and the way they interact.&lt;br />&lt;br />They role-played being teams of consultants tendering for a contract to design a new digital radio alarm for a hotel chain client. The brief was that hotel guests must find it instinctively easy to use without the need for instructions or help. Initially the groups learned a range of usability evaluation techniques that they then used to evaluate a variety of commercially available digital radios and alarms, uncovering problems in the designs that made them hard for novices to use. This experience formed the basis for them developing their own designs that avoided the problems of those evaluated. The winning design was chosen by the expert panel after a knockout competition, Dragon?s Den style, with prizes supplied by Intel. A permanent online version of the workshop was also developed (http://www.cs4fn.org/usability/hotelalarm/).&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1999</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1834</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>The Royal Society - AI</gtr:description><gtr:end>2008-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C511353F-B7D3-403A-A498-039D0E97C6AE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460ce3abb7136.82914930</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>661645</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Securing the future : expanding the cs4fn project</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/F032641/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>D86EE683-05F4-45EC-B2B5-14B2CF1E8E45</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ebb6ca25ebb6cb6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This was a public engagement award so there is no research. However the activities have had a range of impacts - feeding in to the cs4fn project and providing a set of resources for that. The activities involved have been adapted and used in a range of ways and ultimately contributed to the thinking and public engagement activities of the public engagement strand of the EPSRC CHI+MED programme grant which is concerned with safety of medical device use.

Anecdotally we have been told of their use or inspiration by other people doing public engagement around the world, and most recently feeding in to resources for supporting new school computing curriculum (eg in New Zealand).

Most recently (2015), some of the ideas and activities have fed into work done on grants funded by the GLA and DfE to develop resources and CPD activities for teachers, supporting the introduction of the new English computing curriculum. The Teaching London Computing (teachinglondoncomputin.org) website that hosts this has had hundreds of thousands of visits from countries worldwide.

Anecdotally this work also helped inspire those lobbying for changes to the new school Design and Technology curriculum which as a result now includes topics related to interaction design.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C5AD08DF-1D79-4F50-879B-F3A1DD0A4E5F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460c9257aeec1.58574242</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was a public engagement project supporting a Science Week Workshop for school students. There are therefore no research findings as such. Evaluation was generally positive as summarised below:

- The idea of a usability workshop for science week was very popular, with the workshop oversubscribed.

- Attendees were from a good mix of ethnic and gender backgrounds.

- The majority of participants rated the workshop positively for interest, enjoyability, topicality and as educational with very few negative ratings.

- Participants felt that the structure, materials and organisation of the day was good.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The resources from the workshop have been made available via the cs4fn public engagement project website and so can be used in schools, by interested individuals or as the basis of future workshops.
