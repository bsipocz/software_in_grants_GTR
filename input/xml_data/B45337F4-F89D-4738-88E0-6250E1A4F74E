The primary aim of the project is: 'Through a 'design-led' approach, further exploit the creative and commercial potential of 'high value' Eco-material, developed within the previous AHRC funded award'.
The original research, with its roots in craft practice, involved developing a process for converting glass, ceramic and mineral waste into a functional, aesthetic, high-value Eco-material. The innovative material offers architects and designers a cladding and surface product imbued with a unique aesthetic, possessing significant sustainable properties. 
The kiln casting process converts 'low value' waste into a 'high value' product, made from 97-100% recycled waste, without any cementatious or synthetic polymers, used in many existing 'green' composite products. The process utilizes locally sourced waste, thus avoiding excessive transportation of raw materials. All manufacturing waste can be re-introduced into the input stream (Zero Waste, Closed Loop Manufacturing) and can be recycled at end of life (Cradle to Cradle Design Paradigm, End of Life Manufacturing). 
Whilst the Research Team developed a number of prototype samples, demonstrating a wide range of aesthetic qualities, the resources available within the existing research facility limited the creative scope of the research.
This project involves establishing a pilot-manufacturing unit, which would enhance creative development of the new material and facilitate increased scales of production (size and volume). Through increasing the creative and commercial potential of the material, the project will expand the aesthetic vocabulary for architects, designers and craft-makers - offering a broader range of design solutions.
The research team intend developing 'design led' products, aimed at architects and designers who are particularly focused on the use of innovative and sustainable building products. A priority of the research team is to exploit how increased scales of manufacture, in turn increases the creative possibilities, through previously unforeseen artistic output, including the possibility for engagement in public art projects and engendering a sense of place through utilizing locally sourced raw materials.
The project entails the Research Team working in collaboration with a project partner, Recycling Lives (RL), a 'Queens Award for Sustainable Enterprise' winning company, based in Preston, UK. RL are a perfect fit as partner as they are a major UK recycling company with over forty years experience in the recycling and waste management industry. It is proposed that the pilot plant would be established on their premises. They will provide, in kind, manufacturing, business administration, sales and marketing support, through their company infrastructure. 
An unforeseen pathway to impact, emerging from the above-completed research, addresses the recycling of CRT lead-bearing glass - currently presenting a major environmental problem to both the UK and global recycling industry, due to the high lead content of the glass. With 1.9 billion screens still in use globally, there is an urgent need to develop novel, environmentally acceptable solutions. 
The research team has undertaken preliminary empirical research, which suggests that the incorporation of CRT glass in the new Eco-material can result in the lead content being safely encapsulated. Proving the safe encapsulation of lead within the new Eco-material, would be a crucial step towards realising the commercial potential of CRT lead glass, whilst also offering a novel solution to the CRT recycling problem. 

The project will demonstrate how research, originating within creative art practice, can lead to the delivery of significant creative, economic, social and environmental impacts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project offers four key areas of impact, each increasing as and when the manufacturing and commercial activity develops over time: design/creativity, economic, environmental and social. 
Firstly, the project will deliver design/creativity impacts. The functional and aesthetic properties of the new material, combined with the opportunity to increase scales of production, offers artists, designers craft-makers and architects, significant opportunity for creative development and expression. The potential of the material spans the spectrum of creative activity from one-off sculptural forms, design-led bespoke items, to high volume, mass-produced products; providing a new 'aesthetic vocabulary' for existing exterior and interior architectural applications such as tiling, cladding, counter surfaces etc.
Exploiting the creative potential of the new material, would in turn would deliver economic impacts through sales of products and employment. The Research Team expects to be in a position to start trading by the end of the grant. If proven successful, the longer-term objective would be to expand production within the UK. 
The direct benefits to the UK economy are in anticipated employment, revenue generation and tax receipts. In the short to medium term (years one and two) the pilot plant will create between three and six manufacturing jobs along with between two and four sales and marketing jobs within the UK. In the longer term, increasing production capacity would further increase employment opportunities. 
Thirdly, the project offers significant environmental impact through stakeholders in the following industries and fields:
* The CRT and post-consumer glass recycling industries;
* The ceramic &amp;amp; glass industries;
* Waste management and disposal;
* Sustainable building materials industry;
Government agencies including the Environment Agency, WRAP and DEFRA.
The project anticipates direct benefits to the UK environment and in the longer term wider global environment in four ways; by diverting both hazardous and non-hazardous waste from landfill; by reducing reliance on finite virgin building materials; by reducing global transportation of raw materials and finally by reducing the transport of hazardous waste to developing countries.
A distinct and potentially important impact will be the development a novel method for the safe re-use of CRT funnel glass. Disposal of CRT glass represents a considerable global problem. Without new applications for CRT much of this hazardous glass currently stockpiled around the UK would need to be disposed of in specialist landfill. 
The social impacts of the project will initially be realised through project partners Recycling Lives. The pilot plant workforce will be drawn from RL's corporate social responsibility initiative, which currently employs vulnerable and marginalised individuals on predominately unskilled jobs within the recycling industry. Working alongside the Research Team, setting up and running pilot manufacturing plant will give the workforce, manufacturing experience and skills that are transferrable to the wider ceramic, stone and tile industry. If the pilot plant proves successful, the Research Team envisage a larger manufacturing plant could be established, involving a larger workforce, further increasing the economic and social impacts.
With the ultimate aim being to exploit the technology in other territories, where the same wastes are available and similar environmental and legislative concerns are important, the project could generate potentially significant global economic, environmental and social impacts.
Impacts disseminated through non-academic channels will be in the form of company press releases and targeted marketing of the products attributes via design and architectural journals and magazines, as well as through trade fairs and exhibitions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78527</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Artwork obtained for permanent display in the New Taipei City Yingge Ceramic Museum, Taipei, Taiwan.

My contribution to the Clay Cargoes project involved dredging sections of the canal system in Stoke in order to gather shards of pottery discarded by the pottery industry.
I also gathered pottery shards from the bank of the River Thames in London.
The gathered material was used to create a piece of work - 'Shard Vessel' - applying processes of fusing together recycled material developed in other projects.

Development of a product range in readiness for full production. 
The the Investigators have undertaken a process of creative development and prototype production of a range of new products, in order to begin exploiting the artistic/creative possibilities of the new material. In particular they identified an existing product commonly known as a 'slip'. This product is essentially a decorative tile, designed to embellish existing wall surfaces. This product is increasingly popular with architects and interior designers, evidenced in numerous new architecture projects and high street stores. Existing products are either made in either brick clay or thin sections of imported stone - relying entirely on unreplenishable sources of raw material.
Using this basic idea, the investigators have designed a range of decorative facing slips made entirely from 100% waste material. The original, simple tessellating shape has been expanded to become more three dimensional, offering a far wider range of aesthetic possibilities. A variety of dimensions, configurations, textures and colours have been developed, offering a range of creative possibilities. This product and its associated making processes is now in a state of readiness awaiting larger scale production. 

Imbuing a sense of place within the new material and products we create, is a central part of the aesthetic aims of the project. The Investigators have used the period to develop two projects, which explore introducing a 'Sense of Place' within the material. The first project involved investigating how Welsh slate waste may be utilised within the process. Slate waste is in abundance across many areas of North Wales and Cumbria. Furthermore, this material defines the architectural vernacular of many towns and villages in these regions. As such, the Investigators saw this material providing an ideal opportunity to develop a new material, with the aim being to both capitalise on the huge volumes of waste slate, whilst echoing the natural aesthetic of the region. The Investigators have undertaken a significant number tests introducing varying percentages of crushed slate waste. The team are continuing to develop tests with this material, believing it broadens the overall aesthetic scope of the new material. 

The second Place-based project has been an evolving collaboration with Clayground Collective, a London Based arts group that work with various artists and designers using ceramics. Their project 'Clay Cargo 2014', seeks to renew the connection between ceramics and the waterways, examining sites along the canals between London, Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent. 
The investigators were invited to respond to two sites: Middleport Pottery in Stoke and the Thames foreshore. The project makes use of the material's ability to encapsulate ceramic and industrial fragments within the glass/ceramic matrix to create contemporary objects. The aim being to create material samples that convey a clear locational identity whilst evoking a strong sense of the history of both places. 
At Middleport pottery fragments of broken pottery were dredged up from the canal and dug from local spoil heaps, before being encapsulated within the forming process in ways that retain the identity of each fragment. 
Along the Thames foreshore the tide reveals a huge range of ceramic fragments from broken medieval pottery to turn of the century tobacco pipes; the variety of objects reflecting the rich social history along the Thames. Similar to the Middleport work, these shard fragments were encapsulated within the glass ceramic matrix, changing the meaning of the found objects through a process of metamorphosis. The discarded fragments of pottery are transformed into a piece of art that is both contemporary in it's appearance and intent, yet is imbued with a strong resonance of both history and place. 

The Investigators see this objective of the project as increasingly important, providing many opportunities for the creation of products that convey site-specific messages about social history and industrial archeology. In turn, the Investigators believe this can be capitalised on commercially, providing many opportunities to collaborate with architects and designers, developing unique, bespoke products for inclusion in their design schemes.

One of the more commercially beneficial processes that the Follow-on Grant has allowed us to explore is the use of CRT glass to replace the glass recovered from post-consumer containers. One of the major challenges in using this lead glass is the toxic nature of the glass for production and ultimately its use in the environment. We have successfully tested a number of CRT glass products and have identified temperatures at which we are seeing very small amounts of lead leaching post finishing. We have had samples tested internally and have had some samples forwarded to the National Labs Service for testing to see any potential hazards that might be present from leaching in service and at end of life.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Currently the key findings are being used to establish the commercial viability of the spin-out company ALUSID.

As outlined in the original grant proposal, an number of artists have been introduced to the unique material and associated manufacturing processes. They are contributing to the ongoing creative development of the material.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>71383B11-E6D8-4EBC-A791-D5817B3EE15D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54637a338d2a05.89978114</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.alusid.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>ALUSID</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>ALUSID is a University of Central Lancashire spin-out company set up to realise the commercial opportunities of an Eco-material - developed through two AHRC awards:
. The Aesthetic of Waste - an investigation of the creative and commercial potential of kiln cast re-cycled mineral waste.
. Design to Manufacture: Realising the creative and commercial potential of a unique aesthetic 'Eco-material'

The company was set up with &amp;pound;260,000 venture capital, secured by commercialisation partners Frontier IP.

The University has Licensed the IP to ALUSID. Currently the company employs 3 permanent staff, including Dr Alasdair Brenmer who is Operations Manager. Professor David Binns is seconded to ALUSID, as Creative and Technical Director.
The company has a board of 3 directors:
Tony Attard OBE - Chairman, Neil Crabb (Representing Frontier IP), Dr John Lonsdale (Representing UCLan).

The Company has now established a fully operational pilot factory in Preston.
Company address: Unit 6, Astra Business Park, Roman Way, Preston PR25AP

The company was launched at the 100% Design International Design Fair at Olympia in London in September 2015.

The University of Central Lancashire has licensed the IP to ALUSID and is currently patenting the new material (SilicaStone), developed through the AHRC funded research and now manufactured by ALUSID.

In 2016 Alusid won a IChem E Global Award in the category 'Best New Start-up Company'</gtr:description><gtr:id>CF694818-E98E-40AE-99C9-3DBF03BDED51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Manufacturing of a unique range architectural surfacing products - 'SilicaStone' - made from recycled ceramic, glass and mineral waste.
The notable impacts of the material to be manufactured by the Spin-out company include: 
? made from between 97 - 100% recycled waste;
? converts 'low value' waste into a 'high value' product;
? avoids any cementateous or toxic, synthetic polymers, common to many current 'green' composite products;
? low levels of embodied energy and carbon emission:
? requires lower firing temperatures than conventional ceramic tiles;
? utilizes locally sourced waste (avoiding excessive transportation of raw materials);
? all manufacturing waste (trimmings, sludges) can be re-introduced into the raw material input stream (Zero Waste, Closed Loop Manufacturing);
? can be recycled at end of life and re-introduced into the raw material input steam (Cradle to Cradle Design Paradigm, End of Life Manufacturing).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461dabe2c4887.84212681</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.alusid.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2014</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L00738X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FA25733D-A456-4A1B-9D5C-7119577368D9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0F0B5443-BE5E-4DB6-823E-B7E33EE35922</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil Engineering Materials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA992CBF-8F56-4B55-AF51-A6876E825318</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design &amp; Testing Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A6348FE-CF33-4F09-B4DA-BA731821F803</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Product Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
