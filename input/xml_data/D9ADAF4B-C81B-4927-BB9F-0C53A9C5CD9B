No wonder this time is seen as pivotal in England's growth as a maritime power. In the popular imagination it is also the time when the Royal Navy emerged as a potent force that helped created Britain's trade empire, a perception embedded into the historical discipline. For example, in October 1880 Professor J. Laughton, historian, wrote that 'it is on the navy that the wealth, safety and strength of kingdom chiefly depend.' With hindsight it is easy to see why nineteenth century historians felt supremely confident of the Royal Navy's role in Britain's growth as a world trading power. At the time Laughton wrote the Royal Navy was still basking in the glory days of Nelson and British warships had subjugated China and India. Interestingly, and notably, Laughton made no reference to the English merchant fleet. Writing at a time when the Royal Navy as an institution was over three hundred years old, and for the most part naval and commercial shipping had become separated, it is easy to see why he overlooked the role the merchant fleet played in the rise of England as a global power. Yet, is worth considering that in 1588 most of the English ships involved in the defeat of the Spanish Armada were privately owned merchant ships manned by seamen eager for booty and fame.

The lack of research on the evolution of England's merchant fleet, and the men who manned it, is staggering because while merchant ships and seamen are afforded little space in the literature their working lives cannot be separated wholly from naval activity. English monarchs relied on merchant seamen and shipping to achieve their martial and political aims. English armies that won famous victories during the Hundred Years War were largely carried to France in English merchant ships. Even when the Royal Navy existed under the Tudors merchant ships still played an enormous role in naval operations. 

Today because of the global recession we are more acutely aware of the vital role played by merchant shipping in wealth creation by exporting manufactured goods to overseas markets and, conversely, for the importation of products the West is reliant on. The period covered by this project charts this development. At the start of the time-frame under investigation here (1400) English shippers tended to favour short and less commercially risky coastal voyages. At the end of this project's time-frame Drake had begun his circumnavigation and Walter Raleigh was close to planting England's first colonial settlers on Roanoke Island. How was so much achieved? 

By combining naval records, which provide quantitative data on ships, with customs accounts and port books recording maritime trade, and correlating and connecting this with evidence from ship archaeology this project will add significantly to the continuing debate on what factors enabled England's rise as a global maritime power. It will also cover a long time period, thereby revealing the trajectory of maritime developments. It is the contention of this project that only by investigating the evolution of English maritime capacity, and understanding the lives of the men who worked within it, over the period of England's transition from a medieval polity to an early modern state can her rise as a global maritime power (both naval and commercial) be fully appreciated. In seeking to understand the evolution of the English merchant fleet over this time the project has two central aims:

1. To transform our understanding of the evolution of English maritime capacity through a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of the English merchant fleet over a period of crucial change in seaborne activity and ambition, c.1400-c.1577.
2. To undertake a prosopographical investigation of ship-board communities over this same period, which also witnessed social change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will be run in collaboration with and attached to the Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute (SMMI), an internationally recognized centre of excellence, enabling the proposers to engage with a large community of senior academics across the University and external research bodies. It will also collaborate (in the form of exhibitions and presentations) with Sea City Museum at Southampton and the Mary Rose Trust. In 2015 the research team will also be involved in a public conference at Southampton entitled: 'War on Land and at Sea: Agincourt and Renaissance Warfare in Context'. As part of the 2015 Agincourt conference the project team will organize a session of talks and plenaries on ships and mariners using the findings of this project. As one of the main outputs is a publicly accessible searchable database it is hoped that the wider impact of the project will be considerable. Four groups will benefit from the research and its outputs.

(i) Collaboration with museums and speaking at public conferences will be the principal means of communicating the project to a wider audience. In 2015 the findings of the project will feature as part of exhibition at Sea City Museum in Southampton, ensuring the project has an immediate impact with the public. Through Jon Adams (former Deputy Director of the Mary Rose Trust), we will disseminate our findings at a public speaking event organised through the Mary Rose Trust. As Seafarers serving on the Mary Rose acquired their skills in the merchant fleet, the information contained in the publications and database will add significantly more detail to the career biographies that are representative of the type of mariners that worked aboard ships like the Mary Rose. Similarly, institutions such as the National Maritime Museum will also find the projects resources valuable. In the 2015 a public conference will be held in Southampton entitled: 'War on Land and at Sea: Agincourt and Renaissance Warfare in Context'. The project team will organise a session of talks and plenaries on ships and mariners using the findings of this project. 

(ii) Genealogists. The published database will allow searches to be made at person and settlement level. This will benefit bodies such as the Society of Genealogists and with publicity through their magazine (The Genealogists Magazine) will ensure wider use of the database. Other organisations that may wish to exploit the on-line data come under the broad definition of companies that permit members of the public to undertake investigations into 'ancestry,' the most notable being ancestry.co.uk. The proposer's existing datasets have already attracted the attention of History Research, an organisation with a specific interest in Kentish communities.
(www.historyresearch.co.uk). Broadly, it is hoped the database will have an economic impact, enabling genealogists to provide a better service for their clients. 

(iii) Public bodies. The National Archive at Kew, could house a link to the database on its website, enabling researchers and members of the public to access this resource effectively. It is worth noting that there is also a heritage dimension to the project. Placing all the data into secure on-line resource ensures that the information contained in these records is preserved for future generations.

(iv) Local historical societies. Coastal communities that have a particular historical relationship to the sea can exploit the information contained within the database to highlight the changing fortunes of their town's ancestors and the growth (or decline) and evolution of their town's nautical past, findings that can feed into local tourism information and museums. Notably, the public body of Rye (Sussex) Council actively promotes its history as a means of attracting visitors and increasing economic vitality (http://www.ryetowncouncil.gov.uk/informationryehistory.aspx). The research can be disseminated to such bodies via press offices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194274</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hakluyt Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Part of the editorial team for the Hakluyt Edition Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>18DD47E1-957A-4E8D-8340-435CE92A4FC5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Richard Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation (OUP, forthcoming)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55cc5541bc0588.54807676-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They have appointed me a full member of the editorial board and will use my input (fully referenced to the AHRC funding) in the edition to be published by Oxford University Press, which will produce the first critical edition of Richard Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have been asked to be a member of the editorial broad.

The 10,000 words provided Eastleigh with the information on William Soper (one of the short films) and included a series of notes to inform Samuel West who is narrating the events of 1415. I provided data to inform a public exhibition in 2106-17 that toured local schools and other Hampshire locations associated with the events of 1415 (i.e. Portchester Castle). This was visited by over 5,000 people. The exhibition was multi-disciplinary as part of the exhibition involved linking with Professor Jonathan Adams who is a maritime archaeologist working on Henry V's great ship (The Grace Dieu) which lies as a wreck in the River Hamble. I provided the necessary information from the historical documents while Professor Adams will use the latest techniques to better understand how the ship was constructed. 

On 21/07/2015 there was a piece on local TV which used the research from the AHRC-funded project on Henry's fleet (700 ships and 20,000 horses). This is the email I received from Cheryl Butler, our partner at Eastleigh:

I also provided a series of written notes to help guide the actor Samuel West, who is responsible for narrating a series of stories on the website. I have also conducted a series of short films which will appear on the website in due course. I am now helping Eastleigh prepare a mobile exhibition, which will tour Hampshire over 2016 and 2017. This involves my project team provided historical information on ships and on the Hampshire ports that were involved in shipping the 1415 army. The Road to Agincourt involves a wider partnership with the Arts Council UK, the Heritage Lottery Fund and Berry Theatre (who are showing a series of plays based on the Agincourt Campaign).

The central aim of the exhibition was to showcase Henry V's Agincourt campaign. I provided all the information relating to Henry's transport fleet and the background to naval expeditions of the period, as well as information on Henry's fleet of royal warships. I worked in partnership with Eastleigh Council on this exhibition. The exhibition will run for several months from 17/07/2015 and is sparking much local interest. Since it started I have been asked to give a talk on Henry's ships to the Hamble Local History Association, which will happen in February 2016. This is in fulfilment of the intention to create an exhibition as noted in the Pathways to Impact.

This is significant to the local area as one of Henry's ships (The Grace Dieu) lies in the River Hamble as a wreck. The talk was popular and they couldn't fit everyone in the room so I gave a second talk on 11 February. The talk was featured in local press: for example, The Southern Daily Echo and The Scene, a bi-monthly community news magazine. 

The Chairman of the Association wrote this in an email: 

Dear Craig
 
You could see how popular your talk was last evening and how very well it was received. I certainly found out more about the fascinating history of the Hamble River at that time.
 
I have checked the availability of our meeting venue, the Roy Underdown Pavilion, next week so that the 10-12 people who could not be accommodated last evening can hear your talk. Our preference would be Thursday evening as that is the day most of these people said they were available. Please could you check your diary to see if you are you available at this time? If not the meeting room is available on Wednesday (or Tuesday) evening.
 
I attach the article which appeared in the Wednesday Echo.
 
I will be writing an article about your talk for the Village Magazine, the deadline being next Thursday. When I have completed it I will send you a copy to ensure I have got everything correct.
 
Once again many thanks
 
Ian

Dear Dr. Lambert,

I am writing to you on behalf of Exepos&amp;eacute; Features, part of the University of Exeter's student newspaper. We were wondering if it would at all be possible if we could arrange an interview with you, on the subject of the 600th anniversary of Agincourt, and your research into the event? 

The reason we ask this of you is due to the fact that, as a leading historian of this period, we would be greatly interested to hear your views on the subject, and how it impacted the history of Britain. In addition, we would be very interested to discuss your research, which drastically reduces the envisioned size of the British fleet that sailed to Agincourt.

Were you willing, an interview would last for around 20 or 30 minutes, either by Skype or by phone. The interview itself would be primarily focused around the Battle of Agincourt, its anniversary, and your research into the aforementioned.

Yours sincerely,

Theo Stone and Jessica Stanier,

The Guardian were impressed at the breadth and depth of work that went into the research. This will be published in the Journal of Medieval History in 2017. 

Immediately afterwards I was contacted by Sarah Knapton, Science Editor at the Telegraph, who requested information for a specific paper that my findings might be linked to.

I challenged the established theory of Yarmouth's decline by looking at its merchant fleet over the long period, as well as discussing the town's involvement in key activities. Interest was overwhelming. I have several offers to return and speak on Norfolk's maritime history and made several contacts with local people. I am in the process of helping members of the Great Yarmouth Local History Association conduct further research by sharing my data. 

Advance excitement was generated by discussion of the talk in the local press: on page 23 of the Eastern Daily Press 10/6/2015.

I continue to engage with GYLHA who ask me for advice on matters concerning their town. For example, on 14 February 2016 I received this request from their president:

Dear Dr, Lambert,
 
Re Joas Johnson if Middleberg
 
 I apologize for troubling you again but at a committee meeting of GYLHAS it was thought you were the best person to help re the above.
 
 As you may be aware Great Yarmouth had great difficulty in keeping a channel open to the sea in the middle of the sixteenth century. Therefore the Corporation employed Joas Johnson, a Dutch engineer of Middleberg on the River Scheldt 'a man of rare knowledge and experience in works of that' nature' to make a new haven for the port. It was recorded that he was paid 4 shillings a day whereas a carpenter was paid 1/- a day.
 
 That is the only information we have on a man who was instrumental in keeping the Port of Yarmouth open to this day and preventing inland flooding over much of east Norfolk and north Suffolk. I suggest this part of his work was nearly as important as Vanmuyden's famous works on the Fens.
 
 I enquired of Joas Johnson in a letter to the Mayor of Middleberg in December hoping he would pass on to a Dutch organization similar to your own but have had no reply to date.
 
 I wonder if you can let us have the name of a contact who might know any further information on Joas Johnson. 
 
 We are researching this matter so that we might put up to Johnson and the vital work he did for Yarmouth Harbour. 
 
 Many thanks,
 
 Yours sincerely
 
 
 
 Andrew Fakes (President)

The key outcome was research contacts with 4 members of the Great Yarmouth Local History Association. I am now sharing excerpts from my database relating to Norfolk shipping with these individuals. After the conference we unveiled a blue plaque in the town commemorating Yarmouth's involvement at Sluys. 

I was later sent this email by Michael Boon (Doctoral Candiate at Royal Holoway):

Comments from participants on my article were of this nature:

This level of organization is quite incredible to think about really.

Hadn't even considered the logistics of medieval warfare before. The level of organisation is quite impressive. 

The amount of carefully planned and thought out logistics that went into this campaign is something I have never been made aware of. It is easy to think of just the battle and never give a moments thought into how tricky an operation it must have been for such an embarkation.


I have received a email from Chichester Museum to help with a visit day in February in which I will talk about my work on the Agincourt fleet and meet members of the public for informal discussions throughout the day.

Craig

Our thanks to you for sparing your time. It was meaty stuff and several members have come to me and said we need more 'real' historical research like this. What you said has really helped put Winchelsea's history in context and explain a number of inconsistencies about its decline. Grateful for any advice on the Butler's records. This is something we would be keen to explore. I also mentioned the possibility of a student project so let me know if there is any interest.




Once again, many thanks.

Richard

This session was planned to present the early findings of the project entitled 'The Evolution of English Shipping Capacity and Shipboard Communities, 1400-1577'. Each paper drew significantly from the database that is currently recorded. It was designed to use all facets of the source material we are collecting. Through these presentations the database, and how it can be used to answer significant questions, was showcased. Paper one examined seafarer communities within a more personal social context and more closely within regional economies and county communities. Paper two looked at the shipping contributions made by the Cinque Ports to the wars over this period, including an analysis of the demographic impact naval recruitment had on these communities. Paper three examined the interconnectedness through seaborne commerce and will draw extensively on the medieval custom accounts and Tudor port books that record maritime trade.

It stimulated a great amount of interest, especially in the database and how it could be used to look into other areas of maritime activity.

We have made a connection with a Norwegian academic team who are interested in collaborating on a future research bid which will involve expanding the scope of our current project to include foreign ships, especially those from the Low Countries, Norway and Denmark.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55a0dabdece4a4.26594160</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://imc.leeds.ac.uk/dbsql02/AQueryServlet?*id=30&amp;*formId=30&amp;*context=IMC&amp;conference=2015&amp;sessionId=5641&amp;chosenPaperId=&amp;*servletURI=https://imc.leeds.ac.uk/dbsql02/AQueryServlet</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview for Road to Agincourt Project with Eastleigh Council</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12B7FB21-1C0E-49BB-97BC-B9700B080610</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have received requests for further information and been invited to speak at the Local History Association

The first two years of the grant were spent collecting and collating all the data from the Port Books (The National Archives, E 190). This required photographing all the port books for the whole kingdom from 1565-1577. Concurrently to the collection of the documents was the development of the complex relational database that sits at the heart of the project. This took four months to develop and ensure the queries worked. Once the photographs were collected and the database was completed the process of data entry was started. This was a huge task and, for the period 1565-1577 , amounted to the recording of over 30,000 ship-voyages undertaken out of over English 400 ports.

For the last 6 months I have collected and started to enter data relating to merchant shipping from Customs Accounts Particulars (The National Archives, E 122 which record the taxation of cargoes carried in vessels entering and leaving English ports) and local port customs (Exeter and Newcastle Local Archives) for several ports over 1400-1550. The ports were chosen (Bristol, Exeter &amp;amp; Dartmouth, Poole, Hull and Newcastle, with all their associated satellite ports) because the collectors of customs routinely provided the name of the ship, the home port of each vessel and the name of the man who commanded it (three key identifiers which the database needs for the database queries to work). So far this has amounted to approximately 10,000 ship voyages. 

I am continuing to develop the interactive searchable and freely available website (linked to the project database) which will be launched as part of the protect. The powerful database (and website that will be launched) will allow users to map Tudor trade and will, for the first time, provide a national picture of Tudor seaborne trade (c.1565-c.1577), showing voyage origins and destinations of English ships and the proportion of trade that is coastal, or overseas. I can also map the seaborne trade of individual ports and chart the careers of individual ship-masters.

Key Discoveries

One of the most important discoveries was the work I produced on the fleet that shipped Henry V's army to Agincourt. This emerged when I was looking at records in the National Archives for ships and found previously ignored documents relating to the payment of ship and mariners for the crossing. Traditional scholarly opinion is that Henry hired the ships to transport his army from Low Country ports as there were not enough vessels in England. However, I discovered that the bulk of the ships were in fact English. This made it onto the front page of the Guardian and was reported on TV and in across other media outlets. I have also written a recent article in which I show that in terms of wealth shipmasters in the late Tudor period were broadly 'middle class' and that they tended to reside in proto-sailor towns; that is they clusters in certain districts of port towns. I also go to show that careers could last decades with shipmaters using familial networks to expand their range of commercial activities. 

In addition to the work on the Henry V fleet there are broader findings thus far. Firstly, that contrary to popular belief (and current academic thinking) Tudor merchant ships are smaller than previously thought (average tonnage of 24). Secondly, that most trade undertaken by English ships was coastal. Thirdly, contrary to academic belief the English merchnat fleet was much larger than previously thought.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>GeoData at the University of Southampton are currently in the process of creating a free to use searchable database that will be housed on a project website. This will allow people to exploit the data we have collected and tailor this to their own research needs. The powerful database (and website that will be launched) will allow users to examine the shipping capacity and investigate the careers of shipmasters from over 400 ports over a two hundred year period. More specifically, the website will provide enough information for users to be able map Tudor trade and will, for the first time, provide a national picture of Tudor seaborne trade (c.1565-c.1577), showing voyage origins and destinations of English ships and the proportion of trade that is coastal, or overseas. Users will also be able to map the seaborne trade of individual ports and chart the careers of individual ship-masters. It will also make available data relating to several case study ports over the period 1400-1550; this will allow users to examine the shipping capacity of these ports, the crews that worked on these vessels and the careers of shipmasters. The website will therefore be of great use to social, economic and demographic scholars in addition to local and maritime historians.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A0EE6250-8506-4C8C-888D-29D1B5B159D1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd76fd7062e7.51334774</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/27/henry-v-agincourt-fleet-invasion-france</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is database that currently houses approximately 50,000 ship-voyages undertaken out of 400 English ports c.1565-1577.
