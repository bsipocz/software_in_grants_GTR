The research may have particular impact upon a range of organisations dealing with various aspects of current political and societal arrangements. These may include:
The Parades Commission, the organisation responsible for the regulation of parades in Northern Ireland, in terms of attitudes towards, and the significance of, Orange or 'dissident' republican parades;
The Community Relations Council, in regards to improving inter-communal relationships and assessing the extent to which different strands of republicanism.
The Commission for Victims and Survivors, dealing with those bereaved or suffering as a consequence of the Northern Ireland conflict.
Political parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly, in terms of how they might respond to the structural, ideological or other impetuses to 'dissident' republicanism
Media organisations, in terms of providing accurate analyses of the nature and political outlook of 'dissident' republican groupings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>269968</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panel</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66C62EE5-25D0-4A3B-925E-AC16CAF199D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Panel discussing the project</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58983ad04a2259.44370025</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has had a broad reach of discussants and analysts which can be expected to expand upon publication of the book with Manchester University Press arising from the project.

Dissident Irish Republicanism in Northern Ireland' has already been published for a wider audience beyond academic specialists in Political Insight 5.1. (2014)

Dissemination and discussion has been taken forward via a wide range of national, European and international conference presentations from the project. These have included discussions over perceptions of peace, threats to peace, the political approaches of 'republican dissidents' and the impact of such challenges to political consensus and marginalisation.

Findings were discussed with Republican Sinn Fein at events in Roscommon in June 2014 and in Dublin in October 2014, reported in Saoirse. Discussions over the nature of the project were held with a Republican Sinn Fein speaker at a special panel at the Political Studies Association of Ireland conference in Cork in October 2015, which followed discussions at an academic event at Bath University in June 2015.

Broadcast media presence has included commentary by Dr Kevin Bean on RTE and by Professor Tonge on BBC News Channel, BBC 5 Live and BBC Radio Wales. Print media presence has included items in The Scotsman, Belfast Telegraph, Sunday Business Post and the Irish News.

Presentations made at conferences have been requested by significant bodies beyond academia, including the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council and the Parades Commission and keynote presentations at several events (e.g. at Queen's Belfast and Lancaster universities) have been provided, plus a special workshop at Leeds University. 

A major conference at Queen's University Belfast in November 2015 brought together representatives from a wide range of opinion and organisations, including the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council (whose chief executive spoke at the event) the Parades Commission, Coiste (ex-prisoners) and the Orange Order, along with speakers from the main media outlets in Northern Ireland. Data presented included perceptions of whether the (relative) peace was permanent.

These anonymised interviews were very detailed, durations ranging from 40 minutes to 4 hours in length. In some cases, a small number of republicans were interviewed as a collective. The research project explored the eclectic nature of dissident republicanism, examining their different strategies for achievement of a core goal of Irish unity. Key findings included:

1. The umbrella label of 'dissident republicanism' is largely meaningless and needs replacing, given the extent of intra-republican division. There are a wide variety of (small) republican organisations united in their opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn Fein's political compromises, but who differ on the current and future directions for Irish republicanism. 

2. The main sources of intra-dissident disagreement are based upon a) the utility of violence as a tactic b) whether the current conditions are appropriate for an armed campaign (re a and b, most, but not all, groups, are sceptical c) the balance between political nationalism and socialism d) how best to mobilise the nationalist/republican population which often appears either apathetic or remains supportive of Sinn Fein e) how best to challenge Sinn Fein f) the validity/role of abstention from major political institutions (although this debate is largely abstract given low mandates).

3. The 'dissidents' are not entirely bereft of support or sympathy, as has sometimes been claimed in media/policing commentary. Rather, dissident sympathy is highly localised - much more so than that offered to Sinn Fein, who enjoyed far more pervasive support even when PIRA was active. The election of a small number of independent republican councillors, including a couple associated with militant republican groupings, indicates that the dissidents are not entirely isolated. However, these elections owe much to the considerable community campaigning of these republican activists, rather than any upsurge in support for an 'armed campaign'. 

4. Dissident Irish republican groupings are not easily accommodated with existing theories of 'spoiler groups'. Irish republican groups tend to emphasise their antecedents rather than their newness in opposing the current political dispensation. Moreover, most downplay their 'militarism' relative to their politics. Their recruitment pool is often also narrow and in some cases heavily dependent upon family connections and friendships. Whilst this may be a strength in that there is often considerable loyalty to a particular militant grouping, it is often difficult for groups to expand and 'brand loyalties' may add to intra-republican friction. 

5. Where spoiler group theory has more utility is in an adapted version of its 'partial spoilers' concept. Again, contrary to misinformed commentary, dissidents are entirely cognisant of their limited capabilities and thoroughly aware of their lack of political or military capacity to bring about decisive political change/Irish unity. Politically they are too small and localised. Militarily - although this was not the main focus of the project, which concentrated on the politics of dissidence - we argue that although the incidence of dissident activity has been quite high (circa 25% of the pre-PIRA ceasefire era - the severity has - with a few glaring exceptions - been low and unable to disturb the status quo. Dissident tactics are thus based upon 'anti-normalisation' in the short and medium term (e.g. encouraging continuing rejection of the 'British police' of the Police Service of Northern Ireland) alongside a broader strategy of building a credible republican alternative to Sinn Fein in the medium and long term.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The aim is to publish a book from the project which will be of interest to all the organisations attempting to understand the persistence of militant Irish republicanism and with an interest in ending conflict in Northern Ireland. A contract with Manchester University Press was signed in 2014. A short article aimed explaining the nature of the issue of dissident Irish republicanism,. ' A Campaign Without End? Dissident Irish Republicanism in Northern Ireland' has already been published for a wider audience beyond academic specialists in Political Insight 5.1. (2014)

Dissemination has been taken forward via a wide range of national, European and international conference presentations from the project. These have included presentations at the Political Studies Associations of the UK and Ireland annual conference 2013 and 2014), American Political Science Association annual conference in Washington (2014). We have also discussed findings with interested parties beyond academia at roundtables e.g at PSAI 2013 and QUB 2013. Further dissemination will be ongoing with the findings to be discussed and analysed over the next year following publication of anonymised interview material extracts and summaries of the main research findings. Findings may be analysed by the wide range of conflict-legacy organisations in Northern Ireland. The research will also be taken forward/complemented via examinations of public opinion on the permanence of peace and on the use of violence in the 2015 ESRC Northern Ireland General Election survey.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>59C7659D-7223-4A94-AD73-0BE24DAFAD1C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545bbbaedb9132.67366831</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K00039X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
