Which motive is driving ethnic violence and harassment will affect the level of violence and harassment in a given area, as well as how ethnic violence interacts with factors such as the relative sizes of the various ethnic groups, job supply, housing supply and the wealth of an area. In this way we will use the economic framework to understand how we can tell one motivation for ethnic violence from another.&lt;/p>

This research is about community cohesion: identifying the causes and motivation for ethnic violence and harassment in diverse communities. 

Who will benefit from this research? This research is relevant to policy makers with a remit to improve community cohesion. This includes: the Department for Communities and Local Government, which is charged with improving community cohesion and is known to value relevant research; the Home Office, which oversees the police force who deal with incidents of ethnic violence in all its forms; the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent body which advises on how migration will impact the UK, including the effect of migration on community cohesion; MPs and government ministers with a stake in matters of ethnic violence, for example Baroness Warsi who reports to the Prime Minister on strategic thinking with regard to social cohesion and big society.

The research can benefit independent bodies including the Equality and Human Rights Commission, whose priority funding area is 'good relations' within communities, and funds community work on tackling hate crime.

Finally the research is also of interest to the media which frequently runs stories on issues of ethnic violence and harassment, integration, and community cohesion. The media has a lot of interest in these issues and disseminates to the wider population as well as policy makers.

How will people benefit? This research is about community cohesion: identifying the causes and motivation for ethnic violence and harassment in diverse communities. The key benefit of this research is to use it to reduce ethnically motivated crime and improve social cohesion within diverse communities. 

To effectively impact policy on social cohesion and reduce violence we have to understand the causes of and motivation for ethnic violence. Being able to identify motivators of ethnic violence, for example supply of housing, allows us to specify where to direct money to reduce ethnic violence and improve social cohesion in the medium and long-term. 

Second, in the short-term, identifying aspects of communities that imply high levels of ethnic violence could influence where to direct resources such as policing, local level initiatives to improve social cohesion, and other mitigation resources. 

Third, because such issues are highly important but can also be highly provocative, the need for evidence based research without bias is strong. Disseminated to appropriate stakeholders research can promote clear discussion based on evidence and understanding of the issues involved. Indeed as the world becomes more mobile, questions of social cohesion in diverse communities will not go away. Improving understanding of why and when social cohesion breaks down and bringing this into the debate is clearly very important.

Finally, disseminating work through the media informs the general debate and can be used as another route to influence policy. Disseminating research through the media that informs on why and when social cohesion breaks down targets a wide range of people. It can help communities and local groups in directing resources and effort, and may make people more aware of the issues facing other ethnic groups and increase understanding within communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>155712</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Forthcoming brief summary article in business school magazine</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2AE0ACDE-F907-4A35-A03D-527617F3C653</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546139e99fea50.77398491</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research development: 
Project 1. 'The Diffusion of Innovations in Social Networks': This project determines how different network structures influence the diffusion of innovations. We develop a model of diffusion where: 1. an individual's decision to adopt a new technology is influenced by his contacts; and 2. contacts can discuss, coordinate, and make adoption decisions together. A measure of connectedness, 'cohesion', determines diffusion. A cohesive community is defined as a group in which all members have a high proportion of their contacts within the group. We show a key trade off: on one hand, a cohesive community can hinder diffusion by blocking the spread of a technology into the group; on the other hand, cohesive communities can be particularly effective at acting collectively to adopt an innovation. We then show that for technologies with low externalities (that require few people to adopt before others are willing to adopt), social structures with loose ties, where people are not part of cohesive groups enable greater diffusion. However, as externalities increase (technologies require more people to adopt before others are willing to adopt), social structures with increasingly cohesive groups, enable greater diffusion. Given that societal structure is known to differ systematically along this dimension, our findings point to specialization in technological progress exhibiting these patterns.

Project 2. 'Melting Pot or Salad Bowl: the Formation of Heterogeneous Communities': Relatively little is known about what determines whether a heterogeneous population ends up in a cooperative or divisive situation. This project proposes a theoretical model to understand what social structures arise in heterogeneous populations. Individuals face a trade-off between cultural and economic incentives: an individual prefers to maintain his cultural practices, but doing so can inhibit interaction and economic exchange with those who adopt different practices. We find that a small minority group will adopt majority cultural practices and integrate. In contrast, minority groups above a certain critical mass may retain diverse practices and may also segregate from the majority. The size of this critical mass depends on the cultural distance between groups, the importance of culture in day-to-day life, and the costs of forming a social tie. We test these predictions using data on migrants to the United States in the era of mass migration, and find support for the existence of a critical mass of migrants above which social structure in heterogeneous populations changes discretely towards cultural distinction and segregation.

Media: article in 'The Hindu'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Project 1. 'The Diffusion of Innovations in Social Networks'. This project examines the diffusion of new technologies. A large amount of money is spent by governments, firms and NGOs on getting new technologies adopted (e.g. from home computers to safe sanitation). This project has implications for which communities resources should be targeted at and the best way to target resources.

Project 2. 'Melting Pot or Salad Bowl: the Formation of Heterogeneous Communities'. This project examines how ethnically diverse populations interact. Governments implement an array of policies designed to influence integration of minority groups. This paper examines the effects of such policies which are not immediate.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>79E46015-BF2E-440C-9EE1-5DFD47C98746</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460decf2b6606.11605489</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/bryonyreich/research</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K001396/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
