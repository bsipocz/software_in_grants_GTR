Thus there are significant social and economic ramifications associated with the utilisation and design of strategic infrastructure assets which are fit for purpose both now, and in the future. Nationally, the construction sector is vital and contributes around &amp;pound;90 billion annually to the UK economy. 

This EPSRC Established Career Fellowship will provide Dr Lees with the prestige and freedom to extend the impact of her research and develop a new field of research dedicated to the creation of tailored concrete infrastructure. The enhancement of the innate characteristics of reinforced concrete with a concurrent reduction in total cement content directly links to key Engineering global grand challenges for Sustainability and Resilience. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world, over 4 billion tonnes in 2013, and cement production is responsible for 5-7% of man-made CO2 emissions. 'Cradle to factory gate' emissions for CEM 1 are 913 kg CO2e for 1000 kg of cement. The sustainability credentials of the proposed research are to mitigate the scale of this environmental impact through the delivery of more durable construction, a reduction in the cement content in concrete products, and material efficiency. 

The 'innate' characteristics of our reinforced concrete infrastructure include an inherent resistance to a myriad of deterioration causes e.g. chemical attack, chloride ingress, and mechanical actions e.g. dead and live loads. To help achieve the desired resistance, minimum cement contents are specified for a required strength or durability. In conventional practice, the same concrete mix is used throughout a given structural element. A compelling new paradigm is to break from conventional thinking and reinterpret a reinforced concrete structure as a tailored continuum to meet a desired serviceability, strength and/or durability performance. Materi with high cement content is used judiciously to boost the innate response of our reinforced concrete infrastructure by explicitly recognising, targeting and reacting to environmental and mechanical threats to structural performance. In this way, there is either no loss, or an enhancement, in structural and durability functions. The innate immunity against environmental actions is boosted for corrosion prevention whereas the adaptability in response to mechanical actions is enhanced through the novel design of the concrete continuum for a greater structural resilience. These deliverables present a unique opportunity for the PI, UK Academia and UK Industry, to establish a world leading capability in a nascent field while addressing Engineering Sustainability priorities for lifetime extension, reduced lifetime costs, energy minimisation and a reduction in over-engineering.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cement production is energy intensive and accounts for 5-7% of manmade CO2 emissions. Nevertheless concrete is the mostly widely used construction material in the world. Significant economic, environmental and societal impacts will be realised as a result of clever innovation to reduce cement usage. 

Tailored reinforced concrete infrastructure opens up vast opportunities for improved material efficiencies and CO2 reductions while maintaining structural integrity throughout the lifetime of a structure. Corrosion prevention and an inherent adaptability in response to mechanical actions provide more efficient and durable structural members. Less energy intensive concrete infrastructure that remains fit-for-purpose for longer mitigates negative financial, societal and environmental impacts associated with CO2 emissions, deteriorating infrastructure, maintenance interventions and user disruption. This will assist governments and policy-makers in meeting environmental targets and improving the quality of life of the nation. 

As the result of this Fellowship, the UK will become the global leader in an exciting new growth area. Tangible commercial and reputational benefits will be realised by UK construction from the early exploitation of tailored concrete technology over a short to medium term horizon. Access to novel underpinning research will also mean that UK Industry is poised to beneficially exploit rapid advances in manufacturing adding further value to the construction sector and competitive advantage. 

Novel, evidence-based research is at the heart of the Fellowship proposal. The PI has a strong track record in delivering internationally leading research, communicating advances within professional fora, and in translating research into practice. The Advisory Committee meetings, Industrial Engagement events and Academic collaborator meetings provide opportunities for discussion and dissemination with a range of stakeholders. High profile participants, partners and collaborators will extend the impact by communicating the outcomes throughout their own institutions, to professional bodies, including design code committees, and to their wider network of contacts throughout the supply chain. This will lead to an enhanced understanding and acceptance of the innovations, greater exploitation, and a more sustainable basis for the design and construction of future infrastructure. Large scale multi-disciplinary proposals led by the PI will capitalise on the Fellowship deliverables and will shape national research priorities. 

The Fellowship will provide freedom for the PI to gain a fuller appreciation and knowledge of connectivities with cognate areas to make even greater contributions towards addressing Engineering for Sustainability and Resilience challenges. The PDRAs will develop tremendous core expertise in reinforced concrete and concrete technology with multi-disciplinary knowledge relating to sustainability, optimisation and manufacturing leading to a unique skill set that meets tomorrow's needs. As the 2014 ICE State of the Nation Report notes 'The civil engineering industry of tomorrow will require a wider range of skills and competencies.' and hence the PDRAs will be in high demand from academic, or non-academic, employers. Affiliated MEng and PhD students will flourish as part of a vibrant, supportive, project team delivering world-leading research and be well-prepared to make their mark in their future professional careers. 

Outreach and community activity will promote public recognition of the energy intensity of cement embodied within our reinforced concrete infrastructure. This will encourage dialogue and the exchange of ideas on how to promote a more sustainable vision and the important role of Civil Engineering in creating the lifelines for society. Excitement about the creation of bespoke materials will inspire future generations of Engineers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-08-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1290683</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N017668/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
