It increasingly looks as if modern notions of what translation is and how it is used fail adequately to describe what is occurring in medieval texts and manuscripts, which function in complex multilingual contexts and which frequently fail to distinguish authorship, translation, and adaptation. Although medievalists have been aware of this for some time, the majority of studies of medieval translation to-date have been reluctant to explore the more radical implications of medieval culture's resistance to modern notions of translation, by focusing on a more recognisable relationship of translation (or 'translatio') between Latin and vernacular languages. This project addresses this by critically reconsidering medieval translation in light of recent developments in medieval studies and in modern postcolonial and translation studies. Rather than focusing on sources for vernacular texts, the project explores how, in the context of a changing picture of medieval language and culture, translation can be seen to function practically and conceptually in francophone texts and manuscripts. Within this context, I argue greater attention should be paid to how medieval vernacular writers figure the untranslatable in the form of the impossibility or failure of translation. This extends the more usual source-based approach by focusing attention less on how sources are translated and more on the cultural, linguistic and conceptual functions that medieval translation performed, which are often significantly shaped by a relationship to the boundaries of the culturally or humanly intelligible. The project is unconventional in bringing manuscript and other medieval textual evidence into dialogue with modern theoretical models, looking at examples ranging from saints' lives to bestiary manuscripts and nonsense verse. The project thus demonstrates how translation in medieval francophone contexts is much more than simply a matter of relations between texts and languages; in doing so, it breaks new ground in a well-established area of medieval studies and offers ways of defining and approaching translation that also have a relevance to more modern debates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Bringing to light new or understudied material with a cultural and historical relevance to England and France\n\nIntroducing the public to usually inaccessible manuscripts held by French and UK libraries in ways that enhance public knowledge and understanding of these documents\n\nEnabling participating libraries to demonstrate the interest of their collections to the public and - by participating in a series of linked events - to attract visitors from outside the immediate locality \n\nCreating ressources offering wider, more permanent access to materials and ideas discussed in the events and exhibitions</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68592</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Translation in Marie de France's 'Lais', class visit (Ann Arbor, Michigan)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>991BC0E3-86E8-4FEF-9CD1-A2320DA6C892</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Class visit involving a group of 15 undergraduate students at Ann Arbor.

The linguistic and conceptual difficulties involved in studying much of this material means that some of the detail of this research is inaccessible to non-specialists. However, those parts of my project which consider images alongside textual material are more accessible to a wider public. An obvious point of access to my work on translation is the research I conducted on medieval bestiaries, which are texts dealing with the interpretation and significance of animals, often containing illustrations. I am currently discussing an exhibition on bestiaries with librarians in the Department of Special Collections and Western Manuscripts at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. An exhibition is currently proposed for 2016 (though the exact date will depend on building work at the Library). I plan to organise a series of linked events around this exhibition, including talks and symposia which would be open to the general public as well as to the academic community. 

My work on medieval translation has also been used in two schools events on the work of Marie de France: one afternoon workshop involving 30 pupils in year 10 from Ashlawn School, Rugby, and one masterclass involving 12 students in years 12 and 13 at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Faversham. Further schools events are planned for 2015. These events have worked more closely with some of the textual and conceptual issues raised by medieval translation and dealt with in my research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D8D4C3D8-5B3A-4271-AC94-B253F05B0135</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54402f207826a7.49341963</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Focusing on French - one of the most important and widely-written European languages of the medieval period - this project responds to the AHRC's call to embed the linguistic study of translation in a broader cultural and historical context. The book that came out of the project - provisionally called 'Translation and Untranslatability in Medieval Francophone Texts and Manuscripts' - draws on scholarship in postcolonial and translation studies to consider a range of twelfth- and thirteenth-century material, including works attributed to Marie de France, romances by Continental authors (e.g. Chr&amp;eacute;tien de Troyes, Philippe de R&amp;eacute;mi), thirteenth-century jargon texts, and Anglo-Norman bestiary manuscripts, as well as saints' lives and devotional literature. 

Unlike many studies of medieval translation, the book is not primarily about the practice or theory of vernacular translation. Instead, it addresses two, related issues: first, how translation is not necessarily about transfer of meaning between texts, and, second, how redefining translation in this way enables a more expansive exploration of uses of translation that fall outside the more familiar, more studied model of Latin-to-French translation. The book therefore considers translation from Latin alongside other kinds of translation either between French and other vernacular languages or between different kinds of French (different dialects of French, different registers, etc.). Similarly, the book examines translation between texts alongside other types of translation occurring within a single text, with or without any reference to sources (e.g. through the glossing of terms in other languages or through the use of jargon). As well as considering individual texts, I also look at translation in medieval manuscripts (e.g. the way different visual and linguistic registers in Anglo-French bestiary manuscripts are engaged in a multilingual, multimedia form of translation). 

The book's focus on untranslatability is part of this reframing of medieval translation. I explore how translatability and untranslatability are mutually implicated in medieval texts and how writers, as well as being concerned with what can or must be translated, also make use of the untranslatable - in the form of the impossibility or failure of translation. What this approach contributes to more established source-based analyses of medieval translation is a focus on how medieval writers are not always primarily concerned with translating the meaning of a source text - they can, for example, be attempting to translate meanings that wholly or partially escape linguistic expression or may be using the failure of translation deliberately to comment on themes developed in the texts they're writing.

The project thus has important implications for the study of medieval translation as well as for contemporary thinking about translation. In medieval contexts, although the book considers more conventional kinds of interlingual and intertextual translation, it takes a different approach to much of this material and looks at it alongside other instances of translation that are considerably less studied. In more modern contexts, the project's contribution goes beyond straightforward historical comparison: by actively engaging with modern theories and methodologies, the project suggests how period-specific insights into the workings of translation practices in textual cultures other than our own can help us re-examine concepts that underpin the study of translation today.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The new ways of thinking about translation developed in my work are already being taken up by academic colleagues working in various areas of Medieval Studies. I remain involved with a medieval translation collective that I was instrumental in founding and which has already given rise to one volume of essays which I co-edited with Robert Mills (entitled 'Rethinking Medieval Translation: Ethics, Politics, Theory'). The next meeting of the group will be in April 2015 where issues of translation will be discussed in the context of boundaries and boundary crossing. My co-edited book has received some excellent reviews already and will be discussed at sessions at the Medieval Congress at Kalamazoo and the International Medieval Congress in Leeds in 2015. I am involved with the strand of panels planned for the Leeds Congress and will use these panels to develop the ideas explored both in the edited book and in my monograph.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F9F4D42B-C8C0-4B3B-96F4-DA1BF23E29DF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>543d7c9541ac57.17089594</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>448E2577-C26B-4109-B97C-EFABED4ABC20</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rethinking Medieval Translation: Ethics, Politics, Theory</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c"><gtr:id>94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Campbell E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781843843290</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_783205844991cf2d36</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>16E78598-D189-415F-B9EB-1FC1F272F2E0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Essays on the French of Medieval England in Honor of Jocelyn Wogan-Browne</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c"><gtr:id>94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Campbell E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d9c46aa2bfb8.26613877</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>93F2ABDC-C967-460F-8291-D557024583C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Political Animals: Human/Animal Life inBisclavretandYonec</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Exemplaria</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c"><gtr:id>94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Campbell E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07a07ab2b83f7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E41E3D1-FC9A-45DE-926A-8ECEB4D668DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rethinking Medieval Translation: Ethics, Politics, Theory</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fe2110ae0b05b1af9634febe2aecda21"><gtr:id>fe2110ae0b05b1af9634febe2aecda21</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Campbell Emma</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781843843290</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_73196557323bf3bebc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>26D588BF-37EB-4D4F-959B-D5418D6177AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Time of Translation in Wauchier de Denain's Histoire des Moines d'Egypte</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Florilegium</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c"><gtr:id>94beb34de7690bc70b4ba3474434f86c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Campbell E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>543d625b978470.45767798</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J002011/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
