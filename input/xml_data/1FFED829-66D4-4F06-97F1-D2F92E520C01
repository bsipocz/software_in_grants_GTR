And yet surprisingly little of contemporary life in the British countryside is ever explored in and through art beyond romantic clich&amp;eacute;s.\n\nThe proposed research THE LIBRARY VAN - A PORTRAIT OF A COMMUNITY is set in a hill farming community, Trefeurig, in mid-Wales / a community and a landscape that is changing rapidly, as small scale agriculture is disappearing and the last generation who inhabited a pre-mechanised world is dying out. What was until recently a community still cut off from the world / without water mains, unable to receive television transmission..., is now a community learning to adapt to modern times. The quad bike has replaced the pony, the mobile phone has spared people the need to shout across the valley, and exotic creatures like lama and ostriches are starting to make a claim for residency... .\n\nSome of the old traditions and values remain / perhaps most noticeably is the gentle sense of rhythm and pace to life and the strong sense of community amongst the inhabitants. Despite the growing influx of 'outsiders' there remains a strong bond between people / a bond that has grown out of centuries of the hardship endured by the farmers and miners who struggled to survive this austere and isolated landscape. And perhaps it is also a response to that adversity which has generated an extraordinary sense of humanity which typically teeters between the tragic and the comic... . At once this community becomes a real and contemporary version of Dylan Thomas' fictional village of Llareggub. And it is in reference to 'Under Milk Wood' that this project will use the construct of a narrator to bring together the disparate characters and fragmented stories.\n\nOnce a month the library van goes from farm to farm, collecting and delivering books. This is a culture where, despite a history of poor educational facilities, books - prticularly factual books are valued. The Library Van fulfils that interest, but it also, like a travelling confessional. It is both literally and metaphorically the vehicle for stories: stories of the community and its population. At once, the Library Man is a narrator for the community. \n\nJohn Jones has run the council travelling library service for nearly four decades. He is self educated, a farmer at heart, whose passion is breeding Welsh mountain ponies. Every month he does the rounds of the Trefeurig community / from farm to farm, hamlet to hamlet. He parks his van outside the house and is 'visited' by one or more members of that household / some people even dress up in their best to go to the library van. For most people the library man selects a pile of books which he thinks are suitable... a few choose their own. In the back of the van he holds 'surgery' in which the life of the community unfolds: the stories which connect our characters; births, deaths and marriages; the happenings on each farm...; local events set against the backdrop of world affairs. \n\nOne of the most significant events to take place this year will be the closure of the Trefeurig village school. The local inhabitants are unanimous in thinking that this will mark the end of the community. Within the research project THE LIBRARY VAN - A PORTRAIT OF A COMMUNITY this will give the opportunity to observe and analyse the notion of 'community' beyond the realm of domestic and trivial.\n\nThere is a saying in Wales that people don't own the land, they belong to it. With an emphasis on visual story-telling this notion will be given form in the film through the character-like presence of 'the land' and the ever-changing light, skies and weather. This juxtaposition between the intimacy of human gesture and drama and the scale of the mountain landscape will be emphasised using a combination ofdigital and film media in a critical relationship.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19645</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E001491/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02EB1D72-607A-4467-BF3A-A60E567738E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Time-Based Media HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
