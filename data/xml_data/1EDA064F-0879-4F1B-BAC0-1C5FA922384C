The inability to touch products during the purchase decision-making process is one of the key challenges for fashion retailers. Product returns rates for fashion currently average 25 per cent and the abandoned shopping basket rate for online retail in the UK currently stands at around 65 per cent. The research objectives are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to assess the application of a novel form of image interactivity technology in the fashion retail context. Specifically the research seeks to address the perceptual gap between digital and physical product evaluation both online and in the physical store environment via the use of novel touchscreen technology, developed by Heriot-Watt University&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to assess the potential of image interactivity technology in fulfilling consumers' utilitarian and hedonic online shopping motives &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to identify the barriers and facilitators of adoption by fashion retailers, with a focus on SMEs.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The methodology will include the collection and analysis of quantitative data from retailer websites (Google analytics), supplemented by qualitative data gathered from interviews with retailers and focus groups with consumers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The key beneficiaries of the research outputs will be SME fashion retailers with online operations and the wider public, both current online fashion shoppers as well as fashion shoppers who have not yet fully engaged with online sales channels. 

The research outputs have the potential to increase revenues for SME fashion retailers by reducing the cost of managing high returns rates and reducing the opportunity costs of abandoned shopping baskets online. The successful application of the technology to online fashion retailers will enable them to compete more effectively with larger companies who have greater resources to invest in online product visualisation technology. SME fashion retailers dominate the economy in terms of revenue as well as employment, and the fashion e-commerce business sector provides excellent start-up opportunities with low barriers to entry for creative entrepreneurs. As such, the research outputs could contribute towards the sustainable success of online fashion retail start-ups. 

There are also beneficiaries within the charity sector that could use the research outputs for their advantage. As charity retailers e.g. Oxfam increasingly use the online sales channel as a means of increasing revenues for donated clothing items, the implementation of improved product visualisation technology could increase conversions and consumer engagement with the webshop, as well as reduce returns and customer frustration where the item is not as expected. 

For consumers, the research outputs have the potential to overcome a key barrier to online shopping, which is the intangibility and lack of product visualisation possibilities, and therefore enable a wider demographic beyong the typical 18-34 yr old online fashion shooper to engage with the online sales channel for fashion shopping. The benefits for this user community would be increased ability to evaluate products online and therefore to make an informed purchase decision, which would result in less frustration when the item received is not as expected. The technology also has the potential for increasing engagement and enjoyment with the online shopping task itself, thereby providing an improved consumer experience and encouraging consumers to return to this sales channel.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>117844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Entrepreneurship in Fashion public conference, Edinburgh, 5 March 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C939A51-908E-4A0A-B1FC-8C6D66F6300E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PI gave a talk about the aims and outcomes of the project to an audience of around 90 students, academics, the general public and industry practitioners, which resulted in requests for further information from a number of small businesses (e.g. textile manufacturers and retailers) and service providers (e.g. photographic services for fashion designers).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e07d43b3b709.86738846</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.enterpriseofculture.leeds.ac.uk/upcoming-events/fashion-design-entrepreneurs-overcoming-growth-challenges/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presenting digital fashion technology to Scottish textile and fashion retailers, Glasgow, 9 June 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C9EE043-D7B9-4A8A-A069-FD13C430FBD8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards.

Firstly, we identified how recent change within the University and technology transfer sectors resulted in hurdles to commercialisation of digital innovation developed in academia. Specifically, the focus upon research excellence in academia (in terms of academic publications and grant funding) and the reduction in willingness of the web developer community to work for free for equity options (rather than for cash) meant that the tech partner required significant proof of concept to further commercialise the technology developed in academia, whilst the academic developers felt they had limited ability to achieve this within the bounds of their academic roles. 
Secondly, our research into consumer motivations for online shopping shows that fashion shoppers use online technology to enhance and improve their shopping experience, not only to save time but also to relax and to learn about clothing trends. Previous studies into online shopping behaviour focussed upon task-driven behaviours and did not reflect how ongoing digital technology development, in particular the opportunities for novel behaviours on tablets and smart phones, are used to satisfy pleasure seeking motivations. We also discovered that female fashion consumers of all ages value increasing levels of product visualisation technology which helps them overcome the lack of touch and feel when shopping for fashion online. We also discovered they overwhelmingly prefer to see the clothing worn on a real model rather than a mannequin. 
Thirdly, we learnt that whilst small independent retailers face a range of challenges, they are also engaging meaningfully with online shopping, for example via social media or a brochure website, even if they did not have a full transactional website. There was an appetite to use new forms of digital technology on their digital platforms, however, crucially, this sector is dependent upon reliable and economically viable support from web developers. Whilst the online channel is said to level the playing field between larger and smaller retailers, in practice, small retailers felt their ability to create a visually appealing website that effectively translated the aesthetic and personality of their store and provided an enjoyable and informative online shopping experience, that could match the websites of larger retailers, was very much dependent on finding the right web developer. Despite the presence of many web developers available in the marketplace, they perceived a 'knowledge gap' regarding their ability to assess web developers' skills and ability to judge their suitability for creating a fashion website at an economically viable price. They felt that greater levels of product visualisation would be beneficial for their website but were concerned about the extra time, effort and expense that this might entail. 
Fourthly, we discovered benefits from working collaboratively with other projects within the ESRC Retail Knowledge Exchange call for funding. It was useful to learn insights and share knowledge with the other projects and the networking opportunities enabled us to build relationships for potential future research collaborations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is considerable scope for research that could identify commonality across the business process of small independent retailers and adapt an online product that fits their requirements. There is a demand amongst small independent retailers for online products that need limited effort to configure and which are both easy to use and extremely useful to the small business owner, in other words they should be at the stage to be made available as a generic plug-in, for example within the Magento or Shopify ecommerce platforms. There is a role for trade associations and government to draw on these findings to develop programmes to close the &amp;quot;knowledge gap&amp;quot; by either providing training or networking events for small retailers and web development agencies who wish to serve the fashion retail sector. There is a role for using the findings to guide further programming of the technology into an accessible, easy-to-use and useful product for small retailers. There is also a role for using the findings to provide a foundation for a &amp;quot;proof of concept&amp;quot; project involving a larger retailer or a consortium of smaller retailers to work in partnership with a tech partner.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8C3AFAC0-FC46-41D6-8283-9A4C8E2C6715</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55a544215ebc86.21567717</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>825E1719-159D-45D2-B4B8-35AED094125A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Utilitarian and hedonic shopping motivations for female online fashion consumers</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ffb90040362355193a5529e952606c5f"><gtr:id>ffb90040362355193a5529e952606c5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perry, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ca91da4680b0.85645096</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>102F11C7-2AA3-487C-B660-637F51007D49</gtr:id><gtr:title>Virtual Reality: the practicalities of online business development for the SME retailer</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ffb90040362355193a5529e952606c5f"><gtr:id>ffb90040362355193a5529e952606c5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perry, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ca9263871dd8.92816586</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L005247/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
