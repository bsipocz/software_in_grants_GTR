Understanding in molecular detail how this is achieved is central to biology, and underpins efforts to understand disease and engineer organisms with desirable properties. Jacob and Monod won a Nobel prize for showing how physical interactions between molecules can explain how E. coli alters its behaviour according to available energy sources. Interactions were the key to understanding the flow of information, and embody the logic and design principles at work, from the detection of sugars to the production of proteins needed to exploit them. There are many similar logical circuits in biology, often presented in textbooks with an analogy to electronic circuits. These have inspired large-scale mappings of molecular interactions, attempting to elucidate cellular functions and their interrelationships. Systematic screens revealed extensive networks of interactions, densely interconnected webs resembling messy hairballs more than neatly organised circuits. While this better reflects biology as a noisy, ad hoc and ongoing evolutionary process, rather than a well-planned foresightful one, it leaves us with the difficulty of picking out the functionally important interactions if we want to gain meaningful mechanistic insights.

The primary aim of my project is to develop a way of doing this, based on a simple idea: over time, molecules change in a way that conserves functionally important interactions and avoids detrimental ones. I will start with a network called the pY/SH2 phospho-signalling network, which consists of proteins which contain phosphotyrosine (pY), interacting with proteins containing a module (SH2) which may bind to pY depending on the sequences of the proteins. Recently, an equation was developed which uses the sequences to accurately predict whether any pY/SH2 pair will interact or not, and if so how strongly. This will allow me to build the network for any species with sequences available, giving snapshots of it in many different lineages. Further, sequences diverge from a common ancestor via many small changes, substitutions, and the equation allows us to consider a large number of potential paths connecting the sequences. This means that I can use an evolutionary model to infer the constraints imposed by the interactions from the way in which they have influenced the divergence of the sequences. The model evaluates the most probable paths connecting the sequences and allows the calculation of the likelihood of observing them, firstly assuming that the strength of the interaction is irrelevant to whether a substitution is accepted, and secondly assuming that it is not. Comparing the two likelihoods tells us if the sequences of any pY/SH2 protein pair are better explained by evolution acting to maintain or avoid the interaction, thus revealing the functionally important parts of the network and the forces that shape them.

After applying the model to all pY/SH2 pairs it will be applied to progressively larger sets of proteins for cases where more complex evolutionary forces come from maintaining and avoiding multiple interactions. We will test our predictions computationally and experimentally, including experiments to confirm both the existence of conserved interactions and the absence of avoided interactions. Once validated, I will explore aspects that are likely to have important consequences. These include how evolution organises interactions between proteins that exist at the same time and place within the cell, how newer proteins adapt within the context of the existing network, which functions are most dependant upon the innovations of the pY/SH2 network, and what diseases are associated with mutations which oppose natural selection. In short, I aim to gain an overview of how life has harnessed pY and SH2 modules in unprecedented detail and build a foundation upon which the same can be done in other systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>I will build and apply a Markovian evolutionary model to infer selection acting on interactions in the pY/SH2 signalling network from sequence data. Codon substitution rates will depend on a basal neutral substitution model augmented by terms reflecting how binding affinity influences fitness. Parameters for the basal model will be inferred first and remain fixed while selective force parameters, which influence substitution rates proportionally to the log binding energy, are fitted. All parameters will be estimated by Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to infer the most probable parameter values given the ensembles of sequence paths.

A critical requirement is the prediction of binding affinities from pY/SH2 sequence pairs using the Multiscale Statistical Mechanical (MSM) model. In this model, energy is a linear combination of sequence-derived pY terms, SH2 terms, and pY/SH2 interaction terms, which were inferred from high-throughput interaction data via the Boltzmann relationship. The model has been rigorously tested experimentally and computationally, and can classify binders confirmed by at least two studies with a cross-validated AUC of 0.95.

The SH2 sequence alignments will be constructed from ortholog/paralog assignments using Ensembl and OMA gene trees. Human and murine pY sites will be obtained from PhosphoSiteDB and similarly matched. The model will be used to infer selective forces for all SH2/pY pairs first, and this information will then be used to construct higher order models for cases where sequences are shaped by the requirement to balance selective forces to maintain/avoid interactions with multiple partners. Model predictions will be validated using cell lysate pull-down experiments, and via expected relationships with abundance, evolutionary age, genetic disease, coexpression and co-localisation data. These integrated data will provide a detailed account of factors influencing the evolutionary dynamics of the network.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will investigate a fundamental aspect of biology with potential long-term societal and economic benefits, provide advanced training and bolster the UK knowledge base.

Training:
The interdisciplinary nature of the project will facilitate knowledge transfer between myself and collaborators, and to the users of the resources generated during the project. It will also provide significant advanced scientific and ancillary training, enabling a transition into research leadership. It will allow me to gain competence in systems biology and molecular evolution, as well as working with proteomic data. Further, I will participate in career development courses in the EMBL General Training Programme and Postdoctoral Programme. Work will be presented to a broad audience via high-impact scientific publications, computer program documentation, conferences, seminars and the continuation of outreach activities, simultaneously honing communication skills and disseminating knowledge.

Academic Impact:
By framing the pY/SH2 signalling network in its evolutionary context, the project will help construct a detailed account of how evolution creates, organises and adapts the networks through which life processes information. As such, the project may have very broad implications across a wide range of sciences. Early beneficiaries, however, will be academics whose research can directly take advantage of the data and computational tool developed during the course of the research. These include the selection coefficients for pY/SH2 pairs, that indicate the direction and strength of the evolutionary forces, as well as the implementation of the evolutionary model and its source code. Researchers will benefit from being able to look up proteins of interest and find binding partners for which the interaction confers a fitness advantage or disadvantage. This will be useful, for example, in cases where a disease-associated mutation causes a gain of interaction. They may also download the whole dataset, for instance to formulate or test hypotheses regarding the general design principles of biological networks, to use the detailed information on how the network changes over time to investigate the evolution of complex systems, or to explicitly model signal transduction processes. The availability of a well-documented implementation and its source code will also allow researchers to apply it to other systems, either pY/SH2-based or otherwise, or to further refine or adapt the method.

Societal and economic impact:
The scientific output will provide a theoretical foundation upon which technology of societal and economic benefit can be developed over the medium to long term. Possible applications which may be of interest to industry include:

Synthetic biology - Researchers may wish to engineer the network in such a way that it does not perturb features acted upon by natural selection. They may also wish to mimic natural pathway design principle.

Cancer research - The pY/SH2 signalling network is commonly perturbed in cancer, and accurate network topologies are important for understanding drug action and developing therapeutics. Further, researchers could recalculate the selective forces using cancer sequences, revealing how evolution rewires the signalling network to promote cancer cell survival and proliferation.

Infection disease in humans and animals - Pathogens that perturb signalling by making pY/SH2 interactions with host proteins include H. pylori, the leading cause of stomach cancer, megalocytiviruses, a threat to fisheries, and some African swine fever virus strains that threaten European livestock. Pathogen and host pY/SH2 sequences may be combined with our evolutionary model to determine which interactions with host proteins are being maintained by natural selection acting on the pathogen, indicating potential targets for human and veterinary drugs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220708</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EMBO Instructor (Barcelona)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C33D742-7A39-4108-B88E-427D0ADBADF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Supervisor and workshop presenter at the EMBO workshop &amp;quot;Integrative modelling of biomolecular interactions&amp;quot;, Barcelona.
