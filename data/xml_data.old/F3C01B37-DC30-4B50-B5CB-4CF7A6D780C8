Risk factors for these include poor antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance, lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy, poor compliance to treatment for tuberculosis, inadequate management of preeclampsia, and slow referral of high risk pregnancies to secondary and tertiary centres. Changing the health-related behaviour of pregnant teenagers, using an m-health intervention combined with motivational interviewing (MI), could reduce the prevalence of these risk factors and, thus reduce mortality. This pilot study will test the feasibility, user acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an enhanced version of MomConnect - an m-Health program developed by our partners, the Praekelt Foundation and the SA National Department of Health (NDOH).The enhancements include adding tailored content to the SMS messaging platform; and an MI counselling intervention (4 sessions) delivered face to face by trained healthcare workers. The SMS messages will be tailored by age (13 - 19 years), motivational variables, appointment adherence, language and culture. Messages will be designed, pretested, and refined through formative evaluation procedures, under direction of our health communications expert. The revised program, Teen-MomConnect, will integrate both the enhanced SMS messages and the MI counselling for each pregnant teenager. For example, the MI counsellors will have access to the survey question responses, as well as ANC appointment-keeping status obtained via the cell phone. The MI clinical behavioural counselling training and implementation will be designed by, and pilot tested with health workers, who will deliver the counselling. Starting from week 12 of their pregnancy, the teenagers will receive 4 MI sessions delivered face to face (or via cell phone) at the ANC by a healthcare worker. The study has two phases. Phase 1 aims to develop, test, refine, and then pilot the major program enhancements (SMS and MI) to MomConnect. Phase II is the pilot field test and its aims are:1) to demonstrate whether pregnant teenagers can be recruited and retained in the study; 2) whether the causes of 71.7% of mortality in pregnant teenagers can be measured, 3) to establish uptake rates (both SMS use and completion of MI visit) for the enhanced Teen-MomConnect intervention; 4) evaluate if the integrated motivational behavioural face to face counselling, and the tailored health SMS intervention, impact pregnant teenagers ANC attendance (primary outcome), and the other risk factors for teenage maternal mortality. For the Phase II field pilot study, 200 pregnant teenagers will be recruited through clinics, schools and community organisations - 100 will be randomised to the behavioural intervention of Teen-MomConnect plus MI; and 100 will be given &amp;quot;usual care&amp;quot; with MomConnect alone. The study will take 18 months to complete at a cost of &amp;pound;150,000.The results of the pilot will be used to design a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of the Teen-MomConnect in a fully powered cohort of pregnant teenagers. The RCT will also include a cost effectiveness analysis. The products from this grant will include the Teen-MomConnect App and SMS messages; an MI training program for health workers; research instruments that have been designed and validated for the larger RCT; recruitment and retention protocols and a partnership between an international collaboration of scientists, Praekelt Foundation and the NDOH. This grant application has received the support of the NDOH who have issued a letter of support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Objectives: 1) Develop the Teen-MomConnect intervention, which enhances the existing MomConnect SMS messaging content and adds MI counselling, delivered by trained healthcare workers to the pregnant teenagers, 2) Test the feasibility and user acceptability of Teen- MomConnect in a pilot study. Methodology: Phase I: Formative research for intervention development comprises design, pretesting and refinement of intervention content. Development of tailored SMS content: 1) focus groups of 8-10 eligible pregnant teenagers to determine behavioural drivers, 2) develop SMS messages tailored by age, motivational variables, appointment adherence, language, culture, 3) pretest messages in one on one interviews with a new set of teenagers, 4) message refinement. Development of the MI content delivered by health workers to teenagers comprises similar 4-stage procedures to the development of SMS content. Phase II: Piloting. Pregnant teenagers will be recruited and screened for eligibility from clinics, communities and schools. Eligibility criteria: 13-19 years, &amp;lt;20 weeks pregnant, speak Afrikaans, English or Xhosa, registered on the MomConnect system. 200 enrolled participants will be randomised to receive either usual care MomConnect (control) or Teen- MomConnect with MI (intervention). The intervention group will receive tailored messages and counselling based on characteristics established from baseline assessment. Questionnaires and clinic records will measure pre and post test. Outcome measures: ANC attendance, uptake rates of SMS use and MI, HIV testing, treatment compliance for those with TB and HIV, preeclampsia identified and treated, and referral of high risk pregnancies to specialist centres. The pilot will inform a large scale RCT to test the effectiveness of the Teen-MomConnect. Products include the Teen-MomConnect intervention, MI training program for health workers, and designed and validated research instruments for the larger RCT.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The maternal mortality among South African teenagers is 67.1 deaths per 100 000 live births annually; twice that of other upper middle income countries such as Mexico, and six times that of USA. A key priority of the National Department of Health of SA (NDOH) is to substantially reduce maternal mortality (one of the MDG goals of the United Nations), including teenage pregnancy deaths.

The majority of deaths of pregnant teenagers (71.7%) result from four causes: hypertension (22.8%); non-pregnancy related infections (21.1%) (HIV/AIDS-related, such as TB or pneumonia); obstetric haemorrhage (14.2%); and medical and surgical disorders (13.6%). Changing the health-related behaviour of pregnant teenagers, using an m-health intervention combined with motivational interviewing, is hypothesised to reduce the prevalence of these four causes and thus reduce mortality. This is because the behavioural intervention would reduce risk factors for mortality such as poor antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance, lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy, poor compliance to treatment for tuberculosis, inadequate management of preeclampsia, and slow referral of high risk pregnancies to secondary and tertiary centres.

The trial development study will result in an m-health behavioural intervention for pregnant teenagers that is age and cognitively appropriate and culturally and socially sensitive to the social aspects of teenage pregnancy.

The trial development study alone will provide useful information to policy makers on how tailored, culturally specific health care SMS messages can be delivered to young people to influence their healthcare seeking behaviour.

Cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) will demonstrate whether it is economically feasible to roll this intervention throughout the healthcare system, in an upper middle income country such as SA. Specifically, it will evaluate whether 1) the tailored health education messages can be cost effectively rolled out nationwide on the MomConnect ICT backbone and 2) whether it is cost effective to train midwives and nurses in MI techniques; or whether a special cadre of healthcare workers could be recruited and trained for this purpose. These will be expressed in cost per life saved and other indices of CEA. If the intervention is found to be efficacious and cost-effective, Teen-MomConnect with MI can be up scaled nationally. Uptake rates among teenagers are expected to be fast, given that 50% of all women giving birth (503 500) between August 2014 to 2015 had registered on MomConnect.

Pregnant teenagers who participate in the pilot study will gain knowledge on better health practises for the future, to avoid future pregnancies and better manage current and future pregnancies. The study will impact upon midwives and nurses in improving the quality of service they provide; and equip them with skills in MI and behavioural interventions that they can use in other areas of their professional practice.

Other health programmes, and social and educational development programmes in SA will benefit from this demonstration of how m-health technology and tailored behavioural interventions can be used to improve health, and possibly augment social and educational development. The results will create an evidence base to inform the future work of maternal health experts at NDOH. Useful data and lessons learned will be provided for the global m-health movement, and for informing the work of practising obstetricians and academics in cognitive behavioural research.

This study will impact on the development agenda of the UK Government, as reducing maternal mortality in developing countries is a priority for the Government and UKaid. 

Many of these impacts will accrue after the pilot study ends in late 2017. More convincing evidence for implementation of the intervention will be marshalled upon RCT completion in 2019; potentially increasing the impacts outlined above, both in SA and globally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151527</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Michigan</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Praekelt.org (JHB, SA), Michigan University (USA), and National and Provicial Department of Health</gtr:description><gtr:id>787A1182-B350-4708-BCDB-818E9195420C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Study instruments including focus group and individual interview guides with teenage girls and health care workers have been developed.

In the focus group discussion with pregnant girls, they will be asked about their experience, challenges, and expectations of pregnancy and thus will inform the development of SMS messages that are tailored to their needs. In the focus group discussion with health care workers, they will be asked about their experience, challenges, and expectations of working with pregnant girls at the clinics, and thus will inform the development of the health training programme that will be used in combination with the SMS intervention. 

During the focus groups, we also plan to pre-test a few example intervention messages with the pregnant girls. These intervention messages have been provisionally developed prior to the focus groups. We will ask the pregnant girls to rate the quality and appropriateness of these example messages and invite them to discuss their thoughts about the messages. To be more specific, a standard set of closed-ended user response questions will be asked, such as &amp;quot;rate each message on a scale of 0 - 10 for how well you understand the message?&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;How much it motivates you to change?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How well it fits your beliefs/attitudes /needs etc.&amp;quot; These will be followed by open-ended questions; such as tell me why you chose this number?&amp;quot; This will allow us to pre-test the existing example messages we have developed.

Moreover, to assess the health training programme, we will first conduct training workshops, and then we will use a standard set of post-training forms to rate various aspects of the trainee experience on a 0-10 scale, including the content and format of the exercises as well as the lead trainer. This will allow us to shape the content of the health programme based on their thoughts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C548785A-E6F1-4BCA-93D7-F991BF34D6F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Using this method, several advantages can be expected:
1. this instrument allows to gather information from participants and engage them in developing TeenMomConnect intervention. Community participation is essential to develop a tailored intervention.
2. this instrument allows to pre-test the SMS messages and evaluation the health programme before the pilot test in phase II.
3. this method will be able to provide personalised intervention to the pregnant girls, which is believed to be more effective to change behaviours.
4. this method can be replicated in other studies that aim to develop a tailored programme/intervention.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b3f3c5e27fb9.01159876</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>An assessment to design and pre-test Teen-MomConnect intervention</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18401673</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The current technology database used by our partner, Praekelt, for transferring SMS messages was named &amp;quot;SEED&amp;quot;, which is not suited for a comprehensive message library that has complexities (e.g. two-way messaging and interactive method). Yet, one of the most important potential contributions of this funded study is to design a tailored intervention that sends a wealth of tailored messages that are appropriate for the use of pregnant teenage girls. Given the importance of the tailoring component, it is crucial to adapt and develop a database that is able to handle the complexities of the messages (that includes more variables, two-way messaging, and a comprehensive baseline survey that needs to be fed into the SMS delivery). It has been mutually decided with the study partners that a platform called &amp;quot;Rapid Pro&amp;quot; is compatible with the nature of the SMS intervention. It is an advanced form of the current database they use and will be able to incorporate comprehensive and complex messages.</gtr:description><gtr:id>14FAAA54-812F-4651-8930-81BE5ED09500</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Using this method, several advantages can be expected: 
1. this method can provide personalised intervention to the pregnant girls.
2. Each participant receives a unique set of messages/intervention based on their characteristics, pregnancy due date, and life style (smoking, alcohol use, etc).
3. the method of using Rapid Pro to send SMS messages can be replicated to a larger population.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b405e151add2.99804070</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Rapid Pro</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N021355/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>FA7AA693-7EDD-4A7E-8CA3-6B5658FBF717</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive Health and Childbirth</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>4CFCFE99-281F-452D-9C77-757ECDBEB0DC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.3  Medical devices</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>AAFE74BF-2594-40A4-9487-23A469C7A3C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.6  Psychological and behavioural</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
