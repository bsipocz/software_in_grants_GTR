The development of digital technologies has made it easier to deliver a wide range of information inside and outside of a visit to the museum. 
This new type of touch sensitive replica allows the complex research to be placed directly onto an accurate replica of an important object so that the visitor can physically engage through touch to learn facts in a facilitated or self-guided exploration. This is especially important to our visually and physically impaired visitors and is also an aspect of a museum visit that many visitor's find rewarding. 
The research on fossils such as the Archaeoptryx and the revelations that have been discovered recently about its feathers helps our visitors understand that one of the reasons we preserve collections it to act as a resource for scientists to draw upon. The museum object can act as a conduit for the science which in itself can be obscure to some visitors.

The stone touch-sensitive replica can be used either as part of an organised event or placed on the gallery for visitors to interact with. The information relating to the research can be tailored to the audience as more than one narrative can be added to the sensors and can be updated as new research comes to be published.

Conservation concerns normally preclude the handling of rare and fragile fossils, especially with the advancement of ever more powerful analytical techniques, where the loss of any surface material may affect future research. So hands on is always hard in palaeontology, especially with fragile and expensive fossils. At the same time, most children and adults are unimpressed by &amp;quot;fake fossils&amp;quot; (casts). This project will allow us to revamp the cast. The combination of a very accurate physical representation of the specimen (derived from a high resolution 3D scan of the original) combined with digital touch technology and digital information relating to results and research, located precisely on the surface of the replica fossil makes it a great tool in making palaeontology and more importantly,chemistry,to the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will result in the production of a novel stone interactive that will encourage Museum visitors to touch and at the same time learn about recent ground breaking discoveries being made by Dr Edwards and Jennifer Anne's colleagues relating to ancient fossils; and specifically the iconic Archaeopteryx fossil.

Manchester Museum regularly holds public events relating to its collections and fossil Big Saturdays regularly attract more than 2000 visitors.
The Museum is also a popular venue during Manchester Science festival, where the collection is used as a backdrop to a wide variety of scientific themes.
The Museum has become an important venue for widening participation events for Manchester University especially &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; level and secondary school students considering taking degrees at the institution. This interactive will demonstrate the importance of different disciplines (such as chemistry, palaeontology and conservation) and cross-disciplinary research and collaboration in a creative way. 

There is an active education programme (primary, secondary, University and 3rd Age students) at the Museum, utilising educators, curators and University academics. There is also and out of hours programme for older adults. In 2012-13 the total number of visitors to the Museum was 388,613 and an additional 25,791 school children's visits.The general visitor split in 2011-12 was those with specialist Knowledge: 8% General knowledge: 80% and 12%: had little or no knowledge when they visited the museum. It is hoped that this interactive will capture the imagination of school aged children on a visit with their families and give them an undertstanding of the basics of this research. 

As part of Sam Sportun's PhD research at Loughborough University the project would be discussed and published as an innovative way to improve visitor access (particularly for the visually impaired) to complex scientific research based on Museum objects and collections. She has published a number of articles on this area of interest (Sportun. S. (2014) The future landscape of 3D in Museums. The Multisensory Museum: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives on Touch, Sound, Smell, Memory, and Space. Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield Publishers) 

The interactive would be used at public events hosted by ICAL (The Interdisciplinary Centre for Ancient Life is a cross-faculty research centre at the University of Manchester). They have extensive experience in classroom, festival and event outreach, including the Manchester Science Festival, the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, Cheltenham Science festival, Pint of Science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9780</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The digital scan data of the Confuciusornis Sanctus was provided by the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota. The Confuciusornis is a genus of primitive crow-sized birds from the early Cretaceous period dating from 125 to 120 million years ago. 
The original fossil has a very low physical profile within the stone bedrock so is not dramatic in a 3Dimensional sense, however the remains are finely preserved and the study of the chemistry from this particular fossil has led to breakthroughs in the understanding of the colour of fossilised feathers. 
From a visitor point of view the project also helps to illustrate how the preservation and conservation of our artefacts in museums is important and highlights the need to preserve and not contaminate or obscure the evidence that resides in the material of the object. The analytical instrumentation that has enabled the chemical evidence on the Confuciusornis Sanctus to be analysed has only been available in recent a years; who knows what technology will become available in 20 or 30 years' time that can illuminate us further about the life of these fossil &amp;quot;birds&amp;quot;. 
It was important to produce the replica fossil in stone to mimic the original as closely as possible so that the museum visitor's gains a sense of materiality of the fossil, particularly for our visitors who have a visual or sensory impairment. Nearly all copies of such fossils that reside in museums have been cast in plaster and are fairly common place as teaching tools. There is always the risk of damage and removal of original material evidence when a museum object (fossil in this case) is moulded and cast. 3D scanning now makes it possible to record the surface detail in microscopic detail. Very accurate 3D prints can be made in nylon based materials however they feel warm to the touch and significantly different to the stone fossil.
We worked with Stone Circle an experienced company who provide high quality stone masonry for projects internationally. They worked with us to provide the highest resolution machined stone replica within our budget. A limestone was chosen which was similar to the original from 4 samples. They in fact provided two stone replica editions. The finer the resolution and accuracy of the machining the longer the stone needs to remain on the CNC machine and consequently the more expensive the product; because the profile of the Confuciusornis Sanctus fossil is so low and fine there was an assumption that we would want the detail of the fossilised remains to be more prominent on the surface, so a lower resolution and slightly cruder replica was made alongside a second finer and more accurate edition. The slightly cruder edition may be better for those of our visitors who have less sensitivity in their finger as the skeleton of the bird is more accentuated. The finer version is almost indistinguishable to the original in profile. Watercolour paint was added to provide the visual comparison to the original staining that was left by the soft tissue.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BCE2CB7C-BB78-430F-B47A-08959FCE3E73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Digital touch replica of Confuciusornis Sanctus will be used in a number of ways. Firstly we will be using and evaluating the interactive and its information in our School fossil sessions (Key Stage 2 and A level) and will change the information and functionality of the interactive dependent on feedback and learning ability. Multiple digital narratives will be added to the sensors in the next 6 months. It will also be evaluated by children with a range of Autism spectrum disorder who require the information to be delivered in very particular ways.

These sections of digital information (text, audio, video and image) are placed on the sensors where they are relevant to the surface of the fossil. There are also a numbe of free sensors that allow for more general information to be added.
For example the area on the fossil around the beak is touch-sensitive and the information on the first narrative released is: 
 1) Sensor on the beak (Image showing calcium and phosphorus map)

&amp;quot;One of the most important features of Confuciusornis Sanctus, is its beak. It is the oldest known bird with a beak that didn't contain teeth, marking an important evolutionary step in the evolution of birds from dinosaurs.&amp;quot;

The aim is to make digital touch interactives as accessible as possible to all users; with and without disabilities. 
In these workshops the visually impaired users were observed as they physically explored the digtial touch replicas and the haptic Probos interface. They interrogate the objects and digital interfaces in very different ways to sighted people and it is important to understand how the sensors can be programmed specifically for their touch, so they can access and release the information programmed onto the object in a meaningful way.

The interactive worked well alongside the accessioned museum objects that we also brought along for the event. These were contemporary with the original Confuciusornis Sanctus specimen, however these could not be touched in the same way as the interactive. Using accessioned collections at these types of events is a normal part of Manchester Museum outreach session - what was useful to see was the way this outreach work could be complimented by these types of stone digital interactives, which independently deliever additional levels of information written by scientists, conservators and msueum educational experts relating to the specimens which could be interrogated separately. The information on the interactive was a good prompt for starting conversations after children and adults had brought up evidence on the screen.This additional resource was particularly useful when there were up to 10 individuals asking questions of the member of staff delivering the session.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6f341a69d04.91700783</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2006,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Bringing research to life: The recreation of a Confuciusornis Sanctus fossil 

The aims of the project are to connect the complex and ground breaking science undertaken by scientists at Manchester University and colleagues in the United States back to the original artefacts and to excite the public about recent breakthroughs in the understanding of the &amp;quot;colour&amp;quot; of fossil feathers using Synchrotron analysis. Digital Touch Replica technology allows the scientists work to be linked directly to the specific area on surface of the fossil where it is relevant, alongside further contextual information.

The University of Manchester research team is an international and interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers which in recent years has pioneered the use of non-destructive synchrotron generated X-rays in the chemical analysis of fossils. Growth of this activity has culminated in the recent formation of a new research centre based at the University of Manchester, the Interdisciplinary Centre for Ancient Life (ICAL). Synchrotron X-ray analyses have been used to uniquely image (on the scale of decimenters) and characterise in detail the chemical composition of a range of fossils including the iconic Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis Sanctus. These results have shown that parts of the original chemical composition of ancient organisms can be preserved over hundreds of millions of years and as such can give new insight into the original biochemical processes of ancient life. The most significant result from this study is the identification of metals affiliated with original melanin pigment within fossil feathers. Results from these studies can be found in the following papers:

It will be extracts, images and descriptions of this scientific work (and several levels of interpretation) that will be found and triggered from the hidden sensors of the Digital Touch Replica of the Confuciusornis Sanctus when it is explored and touched. The project also highlights the research potential of material evidence inherent in our museum objects and the collaborative work that is done to unlock these &amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;. 

At Manchester Museum we have a very active programme of handling real accessioned objects, facilitated on the galleries by volunteers. The volunteers will talk to the public about the history and context of the objects whilst the public hold, touch and explore the objects; however the most fragile, complex and important objects would never be allowed onto these tables, amongst the reasons for this are issues with handling and long term damage.

Accurate laser scanning and replication technology now means that very accurate replicas can be made of museum objects without touching and damaging the surface of the original; so a physical encounter with a replica of an object can now occur in the knowledge that the surface will be a faithful representation of an object that would normally be encountered behind glass doors of the exhibition case.
Digital Touch Replicas such as the one created of the Confuciusornis Sanctus are now a possibility because of the advancements and reduction in cost of 3D scanning, replication and the advent of much cheaper computer hardware components. The development of Digital Touch replica Interactives is a collaborative project between Sam Beath (Sportun) at Manchester Museum and the Mechanical Engineering Department at Loughborough University as part of her PhD research. One of the advantages of this group at Loughborough is that they have a spinout company Laser Optical Engineering which is able to take University developed ideas and turn them rapidly into products suitable for public use and ensuring the equipment is fully CE compliant; also providing a route to market if there is a public benefit for the product.

For this particular project a very accurate stone replica of a fossil was made and novel touch sensors are integrated below the surface, allowing information to be strategically placed onto the object and all the technology is hidden. This allows for a self-guided exploration of the object and the initial physical contact encourages the exploration of the form of the object, the material sensations and then information triggers when an area has been touched this may be relevant to the area of the specific area being touched or may be more general setting the context of the object, such as what is it? Why is it here? And what can I find out about it? 
Once the sensor has been triggered the information is released as images, audio or video through speaker or on an associated screen and can be tailored to the visitor's needs. 
Physical engagement with replicas can be rewarding for many of our visitors to museums, young and old; but is particularly important to those who have visual and other sensory impairments and those with learning disabilities.
The initial fossil chosen for the stone Digital Touch Replica project was the Thermopolis Archaeopteryx specimen; however we had difficulty obtaining the 3D scan data that would have allowed us to make a high resolution machined replica and on the Advice of Dr Nick Edwards chose to use the scan of Confuciusornis Sanctus specimen from the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota was chosen for a number of reasons. This species was published in Science and was essential in the 2012 Royal Society exhibit about the research on colour of fossil feathers. It is not an Archaeopteryx but is related and the interactive works in exactly the same way. 

The chemistry maps of Confuciusornis Sanctus are beautiful and show the different types of preservation, restorations are also apparent on one specimen and there is both hard and soft tissue preservation versus the archaeopteryx, which doesn't have much as far as soft tissue preservation. The person who owns the scan data at the Black Hills Institute is a long-time friend of our research group, was happy to offer the high quality scan data free of charge and as importantly is enthusiastic about getting the research out into the public domain.In evolutionary terms the Confuciusornis Sanctus is a very important species as it is the first bird with a beak.

 Once we had the scan data we worked with Stone Circle, a company that work internationally and largest stone masonry factory in the south of England to source the stone and ensure that it was the best quality possible. We had a choice of 4 limestones and chose the one closest in look to the original C. Sanctus fossil. A limestone was chosen that resembled the original fossil and then the blank machined stone surface was painted with the surface image of the fossil to resemble the soft tissue remains of as closely as possible. 
The scan data was then adapted to incorporate the sensors on the reverse of the relief and the areas of interest on the fossil were identified by Dr Nick Edwards and Dr Jennifer Anne so that the number of sensors and their placement could be established. Once this was done the electronic sensor board was produced to mirror the surface of the fossil and the identified areas of interest. The information that is presently on the fossil has been written by both academics and is written in a way that is accessible however it would need some interpretation if it was to be accessible to some of our visitors with different learning abilities. 
The next stage of the project is to understand and evaluate how this academic information can be explained and introduced in a way that makes it relevant to the object and encourages the visitor to want to learn more about the fossil, the museum collection and the science that has been undertaken on the object. 
The digital platform that delivers the information is capable of providing several narratives and the visitor/ user can decide on which information to interact with. It is only triggered if the object is touched and explored.

Digital Touch replicas and the haptic Probos (3D digital scans incorporated into a novel 3D haptic digital environment) have also been trialled successfully with visually impaired user groups. The AMBAVIs project (http://www.ambavis.eu/) is referenced elsewhere in the submission. Both technologies have proved to be successful in engaging visitors with sensory disabilities in new ways with Museum collections, stories and research and both technologies will be demonstrated by the visitor services team during the exhibition Object Lessons (May- Sept 2017) at Manchester Museum in which the Confuciusornis Sanctus digtial touch replica will be included. 

One of the aims of any successful museum is to encourage return visits by providing enjoyable environments that encourage learning and to attract visitors who have additional needs who have in the past felt excluded. For a University museum such as Manchester Museum it is also important that the visitors understand the importance and connection of the museum and its collections to the wider University research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>82C203D3-FCD0-40AB-A8EF-475E5B6D217C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>570fa080a2bb77.80476578</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objectives of the projects were met by producing a new type of accurate stone interactive that delivers the story of the object and the findings of the research scientists when touched.

It combines the hard work and collaboration of scientists and museum specialist from both the US and UK and bringing together a wide set of experience, including museum education, palaeontology, conservation, synchrotron science and exhibits design to produce a multi-layered interactive that can continue to evolve in the future as new findings are discovered and feedback from users are incorporated to make it a meaningful and enjoyable experience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research being done with non-destructive synchrotron generated X-rays in the chemical analysis of fossils is already ground breaking and engaging: Pigment patterns from the prehistoric past:http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=7199. 

This project seeks to widen its appeal and make it more accessible to a wider demographic of museum visitors.
The next stage of this project is for us to evaluate the learning potential that this fossil interactive provides for our visitors and school groups both in the gallery and as an outreach activity. 
We have the ability to offer multiple digital narratives from the same object and these can be programmed for many different learning styles and capabilities. The digital touch interactives have the potential to present the research science of colleagues at the university in a novel and entertaining way and directly relate this research to our museum collections and objects 
Interactives provide a way to get visitors to explore beyond the object itself in a more fun and engaging way then simple text. These types of exhibits combine visual, spatial, aural and physical types of learning, making the object and the accompanying information accessible to a wide spectrum of learners. These types of multilevel learning platform interactives should be further embraced by areas that wish to fully immerse their objects/ideas to the public. Other areas that could benefit from such interactives would be art museums, where objects are often hands off.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BAB55640-6513-4EE2-95B9-81CD001EDF89</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>570fa068dda7d3.50088692</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/M006662/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
