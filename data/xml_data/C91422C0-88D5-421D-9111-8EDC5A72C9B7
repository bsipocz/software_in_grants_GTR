The role of the Operational Research fellow was to identify where OR techniques such as computer modelling and simulation could be used to make use of existing data in providing policy with evidence, or develop models to aid decision making. Two case studies were undertaken:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>To assess the benefits of using Teledermatology across Wales&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Teledermatology is the use of technology in the diagnosis and triage of dermatology patients. The project considers the benefit to patients and clinicians of using Teledermatology. A simulation model was developed to represent the patient?s treatment pathway using teledermatology and compare it with the traditional approach. A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken to assess the costs associated with teledermatology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>To assess the benefits of introducing a ?Direct Access to a Midwife? throughout Wales&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>?Direct Access to a Midwife? is an approach where a pregnant woman goes direct to her midwife (on realising she?s pregnant) rather than going to the GP. The project developed a simulation model which represented the pregnancy pathway of the woman and considered the effect that ?Direct Access to a Midwife? has on her subsequent pregnancy path.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries from this Fellowship are the Welsh Government as the results of analysing the administrative data and developing the computer models will support them in policy and decision making. It will allow them to see how their data can be used to identify areas where changes could be made that would lead to improved outcomes. The computer models and simulations will be very useful in assessing different &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; scenarios. For example, in the case of a model that represents how cardiac surgery is scheduled the model can be used to investigate what happens if one of the surgeons is unavailable for a specific length of time during the day.
 The work carried out in the Fellowship will also enable the Welsh Government to see how the data that they have available could be used for further tasks thus reducing the need to collect more data which can be costly. The project may identify information that has already been collected but has not been used, or could be used in a different way. 
 It is envisaged that officials from the WAG will be very involved throughout the Fellowship. They will provide a valuable insight into the areas of administrative data that are of the most importance to the policy makers in the Welsh Government. They will also be extremely important when the computer models and simulations are developed and tested as they will highlight how accurate the models are and will provide expert opinion on parameters associated with the models. It is also expected that members of the Policy, Knowledge and Analytical Services group will provide expertise when the models are validated. It is very important that the final users of any model developed have had a thorough involvement in the development process as they will know that it accurately represents the system they want modelled and are more likely to trust the results it produces.
 The Health Modelling Centre Cymru (HMC2) will also directly benefit from this Fellowship. As well as providing expertise and advice into the project they will see how key Welsh administrative data sets can be used. They will also benefit academically by seeing how their expertise in Operational Research is used to develop the computer models and simulations for the demonstration projects. It is envisaged that any new techniques or methodologies that originate from this Fellowship will be taken up and used in future work carried out by HMC2. As the proposal states, there may be a need for further data to which HMC2 may have access. It is also expected that any key findings will be documented in reports and journals and the members of HMC2 will either contribute to those reports or be credited for aspects of the work. Members of the Health Modelling Centre will be involved throughout the Fellowship providing their expertise in analysing the data, developing, and validating the computer models. They will also be asked to review the &amp;quot;key findings&amp;quot; reports and technical documentation before it is circulated to the other stakeholders.
 Others who are likely to be interested are other organisations who collect large amounts of administrative data, for example the educational sector. It is envisaged that any lessons learned from this Fellowship can be applied to other public services in Wales. External stakeholders will be given an opportunity to provide an input into the project and to receive any results from the Fellowship. 
 Although this Fellowship is centred on administrative data in Wales, the methodologies may be applicable to similar data from other UK governmental organisations. It is hoped that members of WAG and the Health Modelling Centre will pass on their findings and experiences to colleagues in other similar organisations. 
 In summary, it is expected that whilst the internal stakeholders will directly benefit from this Fellowship, the methods, results and lessons learned could be applicable to a much wider audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Demonstrating the benefit of OR in maximising the use of existing health related data for the Welsh Government</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21F3234C-AA7B-462E-A8A0-229F180F9312</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 20 minute presentation at ORAHS 2012 on the Operational Research projects undertaken during my fellowship at the Welsh Government.
