This is characterised by relatively unsophisticated and ineffective information seeking based on a 'least effort' principle, and a relatively uncritical approach to evaluating information in terms of its authority and appropriateness in relation to task needs. Young people often display an over-reliance on the relatively uncritical use of major search engines, in particular Google; poor understanding of their own information needs and poor search strategies lacking an analytic approach; little time spent on assessing the accuracy, authority or relevance of sources before using information for academic work; inability to reduce large volumes of information; and satisfaction with poor quality information.\n\nThis is problematic in that a deeper (i.e. more reflective and critical) approach to information seeking, evaluation and use has been linked to academic performance, and is key to the development of the independent evidence-based learning and problem solving required to participate fully in work and personal life in modern society.\n\nThe aim of this research is to contribute to the improvement of young people's ability to develop and engage in deep critical information behaviour - to seek, find, evaluate and use information effectively. The research seeks to discover the nature, extent and pattern of occurrence of relatively deep and surface information behaviours amongst young people at pre-university and undergraduate levels. It also seeks to establish the pattern of development of information behaviour from relatively surface to deeper levels of information behaviour, and the the effects of surface information behaviour, as perceived by young people and those who teach them. The research will also focus on the extent to which - and how - the development of deep information behaviour be enabled and fostered.\n\nThe research will be conducted in 3 strands and will use a blend of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Strand 1 will employ a qualitative interpretive research approach, appropriate to building deep explanatory models based on data relating to participants' inner perspectives, which ultimately drive behaviour. Strand 2 will use a quantitative approach to explore the statistical generalisability of key aspects of the qualitative model developed in Strand 1. It will also provide a statistical picture of the pattern of occurrence of different information behaviours across a large representative sample of school and university students. It will generate a similar quantitative mapping of the perceptions of key stakeholders (teachers, lecturers and librarians) relating to the causes and effects of surface information behaviour, and the drivers and inhibitors to the development of deeper approaches. Strand 3 will entail the generation of a model integrating the deep qualitative understanding (Strand 1) with the complementary statistical evidence based on a large representative sample (Strand 2). \n\nThis mix of complementary types of evidence is intended to enhance the potential impact on practitioners and policy makers - the target audience for a conference planned at the end of the project. This conference will be held for invited teachers, lecturers, librarians, and those influencing school and university teaching and learning policy (Local Education Authority representatives; University Directors of Teaching and Learning). Its purpose will be to integrate the findings of the research within the broader knowledge base of researchers and practitioners, and to discuss strategies for improving the development and engagement in deep critical information behaviour by young people at school and university. The deliverable of this strand of the research will be a report focusing on strategies for achieving this.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project seeks to develop deep understanding of the information behaviours of young people, the developmental paths of such behaviour, and drivers/inhibitors to the development of deep critical approaches. It also seeks to map quantitatively the incidence and patterns of occurrence of relatively deep and surface levels of information behaviour. \n\nBeneficiaries of the results of the research will include young people at secondary school and university. They will benefit to the extent that the research informs their teachers, and those responsible for course and curriculum development, in relation to (a) the need for and (b) ways of facilitating and encouraging the development of deep critical approaches to information behaviour (information seeking, evaluation and use). The conference planned at the end of the project will also bring together representatives from the local education authority, schools and universities to discuss the implications of the research findings for practice and policy making, and strategies (pedagogic, curricular, etc.) whereby deep critical information behaviour may be facilitated and promoted. Participants will include teachers, curriculum developers, policy makers and university directors of teaching and learning. \n\nA report will also be made available as one of the project deliverables which will present the results of these discussions. Findings will be disseminated in professional outlets for teachers as well as academic journals, including professional journals and Web-based interest groups and discussion lists.\n\nEarly contact was made with Sheffield City Council's Children and Young People's Directorate, and the PI was invited to a meeting with the Learning and Achievement Service's ICT Strategic Education Team. Enthusiasm was expressed by the team for the project, and suggestions made to optimise the potential benefit to schools and LEA Advisors. These suggestions were incorporated into the proposal. The LEA have agreed to be represented on the project's Steering Group. \n\nThe letter of support from the Sheffield Local Education Authority's Learning and Achievement Service ICT Strategic Education Team notes: 'We see the results of this study as being significant for Advisers within the Service as well as schools and would want to share the results with a wide audience to help shape the way we prepare students for university and beyond. We would also be delighted to be part of the Steering Group as it would enable us to develop our work and thinking in a coherent way, shaping staff development and training and influencing our professional development offer.'</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>216115</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H03661X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
