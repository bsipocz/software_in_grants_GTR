The series aims to build dialogues and research networks that are international and interdisciplinary, that connect academics and practitioners and that bridge divides between social sciences, humanities and design.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The premise of this programme is that light is a material through which people organize social space, constituting light as an infrastructure of everyday modern life and interaction. At the same time lighting design and technology are a rapidly developing field through which central issues of built space are being rendered visible and often controversial. This seminar series therefore affords a first opportunity to develop social science methodologies, perspectives, knowledges and theories in relation to a central feature of everyday life and the technical, regulatory and design practices through which it is configured.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many professionals and institutions are actively involved in 'configuring light', and collectively have an enormous impact on a range of social and economic issues, most of which we hope to capture in our seminar topics, such as environmental costs, impacts on health and well-being, risk and safety, design of urban and domestic spaces, urban regulation and governance. Therefore impacting light-relate professionals has a considerable multiplier effect throughout the social field.

At the same time, these professionals have voiced a clear desire and need for dialogues with social scientists. Professional lighting practices involve core social assumptions and beliefs (eg, about the relationship between lighting and urban safety) that are known to be insufficiently evidence-based and requiring more social science informed knowledge and methods. At the same time, dialogues with social scientists, particularly in a multidisciplinary context, will generate new research questions, agendas, approaches and methodological innovations. Finally, we stress the significant research capacity within the lighting sectors themselves, particularly amongst manufacturers and designers. Hence, a significant seminar impact will be generating research collaborations across the academic-practitioner divide. We also note that dialogue between the four user constituencies we identify below is not always extensive; considerable social and economic impact may come from simply encouraging discussions amongst the beneficiaries within a social science context.

Given the seminar focus on 'configuring light', we have targeted several kinds of non-academic constituencies that comprise significant groups of active beneficiaries:

1. Lighting designers, architects and engineers: we have secured the support and participation of two of the most important practices in this sector: the lighting design group of Ove Arup and the Spiers and Major design company. We will also be inviting smaller lighting and industrial practices such as JLK DS and FourSquare, with whom we already work on joint research.

2. Urban planners and regulators: We have secured the active participation of LUCI (an international network that brings together urban lighting professionals in 65 cities). 

3. Manufacturers: We will be inviting researchers from major manufacturers, both directly and through their membership of other organizations (eg, Theatrum Mundi, NYU/LSE, which has already confirmed their participation, includes major lighting researchers from the corporate sector, such as Philips)

4. Professionals working in environmental and energy policy: we are currently in negotiations with EC departments charged with drafting light and energy policy.

As indicated in our 'Pathways to Impact' statement, we aim to mobilize social science and user dialogue for greater impact firstly through the choice of seminar topics: we have consulted widely to ensure that the topics are recognised matters of concern and debate amongst practitioners. This should allow use to demonstrate and develop the role of social science knowledges, approaches and methods in addressing the key practical and professional concerns of non-academics, as well as positively developing new questions and agendas that can have real impact on their practices of configuring light.

We will support this approach outside the seminars through dissemination strategies (for which we are also seeking administrative support but will also be supported through our location in the LSE Cities Programme, which is widely networked): eg, we will be circulating 'new agenda' documents from each seminar which summarise and promote new questions, agendas and approaches to the topic of that seminar; we will also use the website to circulate such documents, as well as working papers and new literature. Above all we know that web-hosted audio-visual presentations of key seminar discussions can have wide impact on practitioners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30392</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Sustainable Consumption Institute (SCI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaborations and Partnerships resulting from Configuring Light ESRC Seminar Series</gtr:description><gtr:id>7F89ED35-F9A0-45CA-BE55-516C76D0090E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See details above</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ea9eec551955.69039161-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Philips hosted a seminar in Eindhoven

We have therefore evaluated our impact in terms of the range of participants we have been able to draw into the seminar series to date. The 8 seminars held so far have had attendances of 30-50 people, almost always evenly split between academics from diverse disciplines and non-academic professionals drawn from lighting design, architecture, urban planning, city councils and voluntary organizations. The seminars have been notable for continued attendance by a range of organizations over the full series to date. The has involved non-academic participants in, firstly, discussions of lighting related topics as they can be re-conceptuatlised from a social science point of view, including methodologies; and secondly discussions leading to collaborations in subsequent research. 
We have detailed the latter under collaborations and partnerships, and further funding: the seminar series has been central to developing innovative research partnerships with the lighting designers Speirs+Major, and Arup urban lighting group; and have involved these and numerous seminar participants in a series of meetings on social inequality in public lighting.
The former impacts - those resulting from participating in the research seminar series - are clearly harder to document. Two significant cases: Mark Major (principal of Speir+Major) wrote a statement, now on our website, documenting his view of our impact on both his practice and the professional field as a whole; Arup urban lighting group has indicated the impact of our discussions on their 'night time design' approach in several documents (and Arup University publication on night time design, and the final report on our joint research in Colombia).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9CB4C9B7-30C4-49B7-B625-50AC8714144D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5846da66db76e7.10561949</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The award was for a research seminar series rather than research project, hence findings were not the aim.
