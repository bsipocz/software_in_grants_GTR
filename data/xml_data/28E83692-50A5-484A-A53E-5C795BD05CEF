Worldwide, seaweed farming provides income to 'millions of families' in rural coastal communities and has enabled women to become economically active for the first time, in areas where few opportunities exist. Yet outbreaks of seaweed disease and pests are threatening this industry, leading to dramatic (&amp;gt;15%) declines in yield, notably in three major seaweed-producing developing countries - the Philippines, Tanzania and Indonesia and is having catastrophic socio-economic impacts on the communities reliant on seaweed production. In the Philippines alone, losses over US$ 100 million a year were attributed to disease, representing 15% of their farmed seaweed production and similar reductions have been seen in Tanzania and Indonesia. 

OUR VISION for the Global Challenge Research Fund (GCRF) GlobalSeaweed* programme, therefore, is to grow the research and innovation capability of developing countries engaged in seaweed farming. The GCRF GlobalSeaweed* team will consist of international experts in algal biology, aquatic pathology, disease and pest identification, biosecurity and policy development. It will be a 4-year programme, primarily collaborating with senior seaweed specialists in the Philippines, Indonesia and Tanzania, but we envisage working with many other seaweed producing developing countries through the establishment of a GCRF GlobalSeaweed* Fund, enabling rapid action to emerging crises in the seaweed industry &amp;amp; fostering further international cooperation. 

GCRF GlobalSeaweed* aims to address three key 'Development Challenges' directly linked to the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals and these include:
 
Challenge #1: Secure and resilient food systems supported by sustainable aquaculture - develop innovative new detection methods for key yield-limiting seaweed diseases and pests on cultivation sites and in the wider environment and legislation/ biosecurity measures to prevent their introduction and spread: We will focus on identification of emergent diseases and pests and the development of early warning, risk-based detection protocols and robust national and international policies to ensure the security and resilience of this industry in developing countries.

Challenge #2: Resilience and action on short term environmental shock and long term environmental change - mitigate the sensitivity of seaweeds to fluctuating environmental conditions and climate change: We will empower our overseas partners to develop and test new commercial strains for increased resistance to the key yield-limiting diseases and pests under conditions of environmental change and embed the knowledge gained into practical farm management protocols to ensure maximum yield at the farm sites.

Challenge #3: Sustainable livelihoods supported by strong foundations, infrastructure and gender equality for sustainable economic growth and innovation - understand the socio-, political and institutional landscapes in our overseas partners regarding biosecurity, gender equality and risk management: We will work closely with local communities and national governments to develop a robust approach to policy development to promote sustainable economic growth of the seaweed industry in these countries.
 
Through addressing these challenges, GCRF GlobalSeaweed* will not only produce excellent scientific research, but train 24+ early career researchers, develop open access training materials and an unprecedented digital Atlas of Seaweed Disease and Pests, protocols, international technical and policy papers in collaboration with the FAO and United Nations University and organise special sessions at international conferences and sharing best practice events in collaboration with our overseas partners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>GCRF Global Seaweed* will work towards four types of impact: 'conceptual': contributing to understanding and influencing knowledge held by researchers, seaweed farmers and policy-makers; 'instrumental': impacts on policies and practices at community, national and international levels; 'capacity building': strengthening seaweed farmers' capacity to implement sustainable, gender equitable and resilient farming practices; and our research partners' ability to conduct high quality research and influence policy-making and practice; and 'connectivity': strengthening national and international community-research-policy-practice networks.

...on different groups of stakeholders.

a) Researchers specialising in seaweed production, wider aquaculture, and biosecurity for diseases and pests including; (i) early career researchers from our overseas partners in the Philippines, Indonesia and Tanzania, who will benefit immensely from a 6 month intensive training period in the UK and working alongside established seaweed specialists; (ii) the disease and invasive species research community who will benefit from the project's taxonomic, eDNA and biosecurity data which will be integrated into prominent international efforts through the South Pacific Communities Programme, Intercoast Network Tanzania, the Latin American Seaweed Network and the existing GlobalSeaweed network. Via existing links with international societies, we will also establish special sessions at their international conferences to bring together science and other stakeholders in seaweed aquaculture. Data on disease and pests generated during GCRF Global Seaweed* will also be made available to the wider academic community, through inclusion in the global digital Atlas, Molecular Collections Facility and herbarium collections at the Natural History Museum and DAC-list partner country (DP) repositories. 

b) National policymakers and practitioners in our three partner countries. 
Our science will contribute to regional assessments and policy formation in the Philippines, Indonesia and Tanzania, through existing links with the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Centre (SEAFDEC), and the Institute of Marine Science, University of Dar es Salaam (IMS-UDS) and new links with the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science in Sam Ratulangi University (FoFaMS). We will enhance our partners' existing policy engagement strategies by helping them develop detailed policy influence plans and we will develop national policy briefs 'from the ground up'; discussing our research findings with local communities and aquaculture extension officers to develop locally-informed recommendations at Sharing Best Practice (SBP) events, organised by each overseas partner. We will publish accessible working papers and collections of short policy-relevant essays on aspects of seaweed production and farming to engage national stakeholders. 

c) International policymakers 
To ensure impact on a wide range of developing countries, we will disseminate our findings via the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and UNU-INWEH. We will also strengthen relationships with the UK Department for International Development (DFID) to ensure that its policies are informed by the new science

d) Seaweed farming communities 
Our partners already work closely with local seaweed farming communities (&amp;gt;2M farmers in DPs alone). Combining our research findings with local knowledge will help develop appropriate recommendations for policy and practice, building a good shared understanding of how to develop farming practices that are resilient in the face of climate change, price shocks and other risks.

e) The wider public
We will use GCRF Global Seaweed* platform to engage and inform government officials (&amp;gt;250 in DPs) and the general public in our partner countries, the UK and internationally, through out website, Twitter, short documentaries and open forums, such as the SBP events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5419058</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P027806/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6CA01F47-BDE6-46F1-8679-A31D5317A885</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C640FECC-44CA-4B72-8D37-BE5E5DC0324C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interaction with organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C69AA8D-0736-45EE-BA77-D6E60B4C9893</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>680500C2-2663-446F-B37A-0D07C1ECE21F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant reproductive biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE2D53CC-F199-452E-A1FE-B63F4222D636</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
