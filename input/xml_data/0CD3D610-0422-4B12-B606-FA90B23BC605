Saponins have traditionally many applications in food and health care products, and there is an increased awareness of the need to use plant derived materials wherever possible to replace those derived from petrochemical sources - reducing the exposure of people and the environment to potentially damaging side effects such as exposure to pesticide residues. 
Saponins isolated from wild cropped fruit of common ivy, Hedera helix, show a number of very strong effects in controlling human and plant fungi and related species, and can be modified very simply to provide compounds that are extremely active against parasites such as leishmania species and acanthomoeba. These saponins differ in their structural patterns and thus their biological effects from those in other plants. A number of major markets have been identified for such products, but wild cropping can present significant problems once commercial scale-up is required. This proposal will build on the known ability to produce the saponins from ginseng in cell culture, to provide proof of concept that cell culture can be applied to the production of ivy saponins. It will further seek to provide proof of principle that the saponins produced in this way have the same properties as wild cropped material and that the process can be economic on a commercial scale.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit a number of different areas:
1. The public through the development of plant derived products for health care and other applications which are to replace
molecules showing undesirable side effects, often derived from petrochemical sources.
2. End-user companies seeking to develop a portfolio of new plant derived products to replace those derived from
petrochemical sources.
3. Companies in the supply chain dealing with the production plant derived chemicals by cell culture through
establishing new technolgy and new business.
5. The environment, through the reduction of the carbon footprint derived from the use of complex natural products to avoid
multistep modification of petrochemically derived feedstock.
6. The regional economy by the development of a total supply chain.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65502</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our company partner has now additional projects that benefited from the research results of our project. The company acquired skills and methodology. We all learned that plant cell culture is in principle a good technique but in order to get economically viable cultures, one needs to be aware of the complexity of the target metabolite. In our case, we would have required differentiated cells. We were very pleased to see the production of one valuable phenolic metabolite which is an earlier metabolite, thus we could prove that the system as such was functioning.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B6B97D63-D018-45A5-B88A-892E36B4ABF5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bb14b772c650.13898535</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has been finished now.
