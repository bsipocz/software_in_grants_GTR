The two systems attracting the most interest are polymer fuel cells (operating &amp;lt;100C) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (operating 500-1000C). The latter offer significant benefits in terms of fuel flexibility and cheaper (non-precious metal) electrode materials, but suffer from sealing/long term stability problems, as well as slow start up issues, associated with the high temperature operation. In this proposal we aim to target the development of solid oxide fuel cellls that operate at temperatures between 100-350C to overcome such issues. To this aim we will develop new proton conducting electrolytes that display high ionic conductivity in this temperature range, as well as electrode materials that operate with them. A key aim is to generate the proton conducting electrolyte in situ, under fuel cell operation, to allow a simplified cell production and operation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Fuel cells offer tremendous potential for improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with potential applications ranging from transport to stationary power generation. In particular, the development of low cost cells operating in the 100-400C range offers tremendous potential benefits, including allowing operation with less pure H2 fuels, and low cost electrode materials, mitigating the problems associated with currently widely researched polymer (&amp;lt;100C operation ) fuel cells and higher temperature (500-1000C) solid oxide fuel cells. As well as leading to wealth generation, this will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, fuel usage, and so has substantial benefits for the environment and hence society in general. Fuel cell devices are also part of the Government's policy towards a low carbon economy, and hence the work is of relevance to the instigation of that policy. The development of fuel cells operating in the 100-400C gives a number of potential other applications including as auxillary power units for transport applications. Commercial beneficiaries of the research will thus be fuel cell/hydrogen production companies in the UK and worldwide. Considering the early stage of this feasibility study no companies have yet been informed or asked for support , but through our existing contacts within the H2 and Fuel Cell Hub, the Fuel Cells and their Fuels CDT, the ERA framework, relevant Technology Strategy Board's Knowledge Transfer Networks (Chemistry Innovation, Materials) there are strong routes to exploitation. In addition, work from the project will be promoted at a range of conferences/meetings where there is a strong industry presence, including the annual Birmingham organised NEC hydrogen and fuel cell meeting, the annual Materials KTN Materials Research Exchange meeting, as well as at West Midlands RIC Climate-KIC meetings. The demonstration of this novel strategy to exploit Li ion conducting electrolytes that have undergone proton-lithium exchange offers a large potential to make a major advance in this area in allowing access to a new temperature range for solid oxide fuel cell operation that will maintain their benefits, while mitigating their problems. In particular it will help the UK to lead a field, that has traditionally been dominated by the more commercially advanced solid oxide fuel cells exploiting an oxide ion conducting electrolyte.
The research team has a strong background in public engagement through activities at the Thinktank museum, local schools and science festivals. This will be continued throughout the project, and the staff appointed will receive in-house training in this area with a view to running annual activities (e.g. Meet the scientist, How Science Works (Thinktank), Cafe scientifique, school talks and workshops).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196452</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P033822/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC4522D3-ABD6-432A-9268-0F772EA73CB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fuel Cell Technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
