This will be a new resource created out of an existing digital resource, the online Dictionary of the Scots Language (DSL), which was developed with AHRB funding in 2001-4. The HTS will be the first historical thesaurus of Scots and will be planned as a digital resource from the outset. This pilot project will act as proof of concept for a future larger bid for the HTS and will address the following questions: how can the current DSL data be queried and restructured to create a basis for the HTS; what are the essential components for each entry in the HTS and what is the optimal markup scheme; what type of search facilities will the HTS require; how can other complex linguistic datasets, such as the Historical Thesaurus of English, assist the compilation of the HTS and how may these be linked into its eventual output; how can the pilot HTS website incorporate multimedia and user-generated content to create a dynamic and innovative resource? 

The pilot project is planned to last fifteen months, starting in January 2014. It will focus on selected subject domains which are rich in Scots vocabulary-such as sports and games, food, and weather-in order to produce a working subset of the planned thesaurus which will be made available online by the end of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The full impact of this research will be felt in the creation of the complete Historical Thesaurus of Scots (HTS), for which the pilot phase will provide a model. The HTS will be of benefit and interest to the following groups of users:

1) academic researchers whose work incorporates historical linguistics, lexicography, or Scottish cultural and social history, from whom the HTS is a potential research tool

2) computational lexicographers and linguists interested in the underlying methodology for the HTS, both in terms of compilation and output 

3) universities for whom the HTS will provide a new teaching resource for the history of the Scots language and Scottish culture

4) Scottish cultural institutions such as museums and galleries whose collections relate to the content of the HTS, for example in terms of the social history or material culture of Lowland Scotland

5) professional lexicographers working on new or existing Scots language resources, for whom the HTS will provide new ways to analyse the content of the DSL

6) translators and creative writers working in Scots, or writers using Scottish themes or settings in their works, whether contemporary or historical

7) the general public who will be encouraged to contribute to the content of the Thesaurus and informed of progress through the project blog

8) schools who will be provided with sample teaching material based on the vocabulary of selected subject domains, such as weather and sports and games 

In addition, the experience which the project team and project partner will derive from the pilot will also inform future planned collaborative projects, such as the creation of a lexicographic Research Network for Scotland.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76346</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Education Scotland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Schools Materials from the Scots Thesaurus</gtr:description><gtr:id>F4953ABD-2C3D-4122-A29C-39EFC294F45B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These materials have since been published on the Education Scotland website (see URL above) and are freely available to schools across Scotland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddd4baa0a179.38272604-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Scots Language Co-ordinators are all trained teachers and contributed their expertise in producing materials for school-age children and teachers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Project Team worked with Scots Language Co-ordinators at Education Scotland to produce a series of teaching materials, for use in primary schools, based on data from the category of Weather in the Pilot Historical Thesaurus of Scots.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Language Dictionaries</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with SLD</gtr:description><gtr:id>6EAF9DBA-9C22-4A07-95F6-87AB893AA008</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The final PHiTS website is the result of this partnership, as the data could not have been gathered without the collaboration and agreement of SLD.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56de04640d6486.70222599-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>SLD gave permission for the Project Team to use electronic data from the Dictionary of the Scots Language as required.

In June 2014, we were invited to showcase our project to teachers at the launch of the new SQA Scots Language Award, and the HTS is now cited as a recommended resource in the Assessment Support materials which the SQA provides to centres. In 2015, we began a 'pilot within a pilot', to assess the potential for using HTS data to produce materials for primary and lower secondary education. We worked with the Scots Language Co-ordinators at Education Scotland (ES) to produce customised versions of our raw data, in the form of simple spreadsheets, which they then used to produce 'word mats' featuring categories of Scots vocabulary. The materials that Education Scotland developed were launched at the Scottish Learning Festival in September 2015 and are now available to schools and the general public via the ES website. Our Project Team also presented two workshops on using the HTS to teachers at a special Education Scotland conference in September 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>25E270DD-EAFC-42B7-BE6A-6F2FE568F419</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56de12876a88f7.53028249</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This pilot project has developed the methodology for creating an online Historical Thesaurus of Scots (HTS). It is intended as proof of concept for a future larger bid to compile a complete HTS, covering the Scots language from the earliest records to the present day. During the course of the project we have:
1) developed systems and search tools which allow us to query and extract data from the online Dictionary of the Scots Language (www.dl.ac.uk) and then categorise the data into semantic fields;
2) tested and devised methods for presenting and searching the HTS online, including methods of data visualisation, in a form that is both usable by researchers and also accessible to the general public;
3) trialled methods of generating user content for the HTS, by providing a facility for users to upload their own images and comments to illustrate and annotate the resource;
4) created a working subset of the HTS, focussing on two key subject domains: Sports &amp;amp; Games and Weather. This subset was launched via our project website in September 2015;
5) developed strong links and collaborations with partners such as Scottish Language Dictionaries and Education Scotland. In particular, we have worked with Educaton Scotland to produce schools materials based on the HTS data and we see this as a model for collaboration in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This findings of this project are now being used as the basis for a larger bid to create a full Historical Thesaurus of Scots.
