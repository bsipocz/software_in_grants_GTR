and assessment of clinical use</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/N004566/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Our aim is to make optical coherence tomography (OCT) accessible for clinical use in infants and young children. 
Optical coherence tomography provides scans of the back of the eye (the retina and optic nerve) in living people with the precision of a microscope. This has contributed, over the last 15 years, to significant progress in the diagnosis and treatment of retina and optic nerve diseases in adults. However, infants and young children have been deprived of the diagnostic progress as they cannot cooperate with conventional OCT.
The normal optic nerve and retina are not mature at birth and undergo significant changes until adulthood. However, to date little is known about the normal postnatal development. There are no normative OCT data for different ages and therefore OCT can currently not be used for children clinically. 
The advent of a new hand-held OCT allows scanning of infants, small children and people who cannot cooperate. However, to date there is little knowledge about its clinical use. 
Over the last three years, we have used the hand-held OCT successfully to characterise normal retina development and to compare retinal developmental in disease. This allows us to now use OCT for retinal diagnosis in children in Leicester ophthalmology clinics. 
Our objective is to improve OCT acquisition methods for children, to visualise for the first time the development of the optic nerve from birth to 6 years of age using the hand-held OCT device and to establish normative data of the retina and optic nerve in 12 different age groups (90 children per group). OCTs will be performed in a large amount of children with normal eyes to establish normative data. We will also scan the optic nerve in various optic nerve diseases in childhood and investigate to what extent OCT can help with diagnosis. For example, we will look at children who have tumours of the optic nerve (optic nerve glioma) or childhood glaucoma (high pressure in the eye with damage to the optic nerve). We will investigate whether vision can be predicted from OCT scans of various optic nerve diseases. We will investigate to what extent the OCT can help to improve monitoring of childhood glaucoma and optic nerve tumours and reduce the number of examinations under anaesthesia. We anticipate that this study will also help us to understand mechanisms of optic nerve anomalies. 
We are planning to develop automatic computer programmes to analyse the OCT images obtained during scanning. This will make the use of the OCT easy and user-friendly and enable the use in clinics.
Developmental abnormalities of the optic nerve and childhood optic nerve diseases, such as glaucoma, are leading causes of child blindness. We anticipate that our study will be an important step in validating OCT and making OCT accessible to newborns, infants and young children with optic nerve diseases. The normative database will provide the groundwork for using OCT in children and will be directly available to other OCT users (it will be shared with the OCT Company Bioptigen Inc.). The optimisation of the use of hand-held OCT opens a wide range of settings outside of the traditional ophthalmology or optometry clinics including intraoperative, primary care, developing countries and military medicine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution scans of the retina and optic nerve and has contributed to significant progress in the diagnosis and treatment of retinal and optic nerve diseases in adults. However, infants and young children have been deprived of the diagnostic progress as they cannot cooperate with conventional OCT.
The advent of a new hand-held OCT (HH-OCT) allows scanning infants and small children. Over the last three years, we have used the HH-OCT successfully to establish progression of normal human retinal development and develop a diagnostic algorithm for nystagmus. However the lack of normative data and knowledge about presentation of diseases prevents wider clinical use. The normal optic nerve is not mature at birth and is likely to undergo significant changes until adulthood. However, to date little is known about the normal postnatal development. Developmental abnormalities of the optic nerve and childhood optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma are leading causes of child blindness. 
First, we plan to optimise and acquisition protocols to enable fast and reliable volumetric scans. We then aim to establish a normative database for optic nerve and retina with OCT in infants and children. We will investigate to what extent OCT can help in improving diagnosis of childhood optic nerve disease. We also will explore whether visual acuity can be predicted from OCT scans. We will investigate to what extent OCT can help improve monitoring of childhood glaucoma and optic nerve glioma and reduce the number of examinations under anaesthesia. 
Software for automatic segmentation will be developed for easier and faster interpretation of OCT scans.
We anticipate that our study will be an important step in validating and providing access of OCT in young children with optic nerve diseases. The normative database will provide the groundwork for using OCT in young children.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries from the proposed research will be:
Parents and children through:
- enabling access to optical coherence tomography (OCT) for infants and small children who have suspected optic nerve anomalies. Currently, without normative data for different age groups OCT cannot be used clinically.
- earlier diagnosis will accelerate and facilitate appropriate care pathways for infants and small children, providing them with a more objective and targeting management plan.
- avoiding invasive and costly tests under general anaesthetic for ambiguous diagnoses.
- providing parents with an indication of possible prediction of visual acuity.
- enhanced health and quality of life.

Clinicians, such as ophthalmologists, paediatricians, neurologists, opticians and orthoptists may benefit from:
- a new and better diagnostic tool which can be used in the clinic setting.
- increased knowledge of the diagnosis and monitoring of several childhood diseases. For example in glaucoma and optic pathway glioma OCT may become the primary method by which this diseases are monitored. It is likely that OCT will help to identify specific retinal and optic nerve changes which can help to recognise genetic syndromes or inform genetic treatment.
-automatic segmentation will improve diagnosis and has a large potential also to facilitate adult OCT

Academics through:
- knowledge of normal development of ocular structures.
- study of mechanisms of disease in a novel way and identification of new therapeutic targets.
- Easier analysis of OCT scans with new segmentation software.

Paediatric ophthalmology clinics in the NHS and worldwide both in terms of time and cost through increased effectiveness and minimisation of resources.

The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, the NHS, NICE and other health policy makers by updating or developing guidelines to improve the care of infants and children. 

Industry by:
- Increased use and production of hand-held OCTs due to increased applications and availability of normative data for the first time. This is likely to increase quality and reduce costs of hand-held OCTs. 
- Easier and faster use of OCT analysis due to new segmentation software will also be applicable to adult OCT machines. 
- Commercialisation of the hand-held OCT by Bioptigen Inc. (the company producing this device) for clinical use.
A successful outcome will also improve the likelihood of relevant medical charities to raise funds for similar research.

The optimisation of the use of hand-held OCT opens a wide range of settings outside of the traditional ophthalmology or optometry clinics including intraoperative, primary care, developing countries and military medicine.

Our proposed project is in line with priority areas 2, 4, 5 and 6 from Fight for Sight research priorities (http://fightforsight.org.uk/research-overview) as well as disease specific priorities (Childhood onset eye disorders, priorities 2, 4, 5, 6; glaucoma priorities 3, 6; neuro-ophthalmology, priority 6 and refractive errors and ocular motility, priority 2) (http://fightforsight.org.uk/tl_files/Documents/Sight-Loss-PSP/SLV-PSP_Final_Report_WEB.pdf).
