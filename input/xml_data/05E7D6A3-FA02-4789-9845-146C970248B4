This will involve: Developing an understanding of the chemistry, design, processing and end usage of the product; defining analytical techniques to be used to quantify product performance; determine the roles and mechanisms of key ingredients; develop and test alternative, cost optimised products/recipes; assess processing and product life-cycle of new formulations to enable launch of new products. 
This is a KTP project which will employ and train an associate to develop competence in the management of research and development projects, from initial technical investigation through to manufacturing scale up. This will involve developing knowledge in specific processing, but also general product development project management knowledge which will be broadly applicable to industrial food R&amp;amp;D projects. The associate will work with various business functions involved in the market expansion of new products, including sales and marketing, finance, purchasing and production and will gain knowledge of all business processes involved in the launch of new products. In addition to the scientific objectives, the associate will undertake management training and a post grad diploma (level 5) in management, the opportunity for a further degree and some additional funding will be available for personal professional development. The position will be based at the company?s main site near Aberdeen, but will spend time on short visits at the Institute of Food Research for the lab based parts of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings were used by the company to develop new, more innovative, more functional and cost effective products.
The business has reported that it achieved all three original objectives: 
- developing a new product which has secured new contracts worth &amp;pound;570k 
- increased sales by &amp;pound;100k per year by improving existing branded products 
- delivered cost savings of &amp;pound;150k per year in existing products 

Therefore, the cumulative benefits in terms of increased sales and reduced costs are in excess of &amp;pound;800k. The business has benefited from the education and training in R&amp;amp;D technology and the techniques deployed are likely to lead to future new product development. 

Assuming that a third of the benefits could be attributed to each partner in the KTP, the input from IFR is estimated to be worth &amp;pound;270,000 to the supported business in terms of additional turnover and reduced costs. In addition to the benefits to the business, the scientist also received 4-5 months training at IFR.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>577F2F7F-C829-4135-87A6-52AA284AE334</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464a152d75687.88921542</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project showed that the functionality of the product depended on a range of length scales from the molecular properties of the proteins and polymers including composition and reactivity (Maillard), and molecular weight and aggregation behaviours. Up to the colloidal properties of the emulsions and other colloidal particles present. This enabled sequential sedimentation onto the surface of the product to optimise functional performance of the glaze.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings were used by the company to develop improved and more cost effective products, and take them through pilot and production scale processing.
