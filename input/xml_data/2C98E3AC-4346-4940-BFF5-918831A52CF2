This project will take results from a number of recent research projects focusing on resilience in barley production, and by working closely with a range of stakeholders such as those described above, develop skills and knowledge which enable farmers to change behaviour on farm which not only supports up-to-date science, but are based on the farmers unique needs and situation. 

Barley has been chosen because of its significance in UK crop production, the high level of research expertise within SRUC and JHI, as well as the significant challenges faced by the barley supply chain to reduce pesticide use, improve quality and quantity of supply and enhance environmental protection. However, this proposal will have transferable outputs which can inform how research is used on farm in other crop and livestock sectors. 

The project will set up a network of those involved in the barley sector, and encourage the exploration of what works well in the sector, and what barriers to improving practice for sustainable intensification and improved resilience exist. Once the network begins to explore these barriers, the project will facilitate a programme of interventions which will aim to overcome the barriers in a collaborative way. The research projects this proposal is based on involve a range of important partners in the barley supply chain such as industry, government, farm representatives and input suppliers. This proposal aims to enhance communication between these stakeholders so that benefits are experiences by all, not just by growers. 

The project will collect data throughout this process so that we can look at how working in a stakeholder group changes peoples understanding of a subject, and helps them develop skills which they are able to translate into changes in behaviour on farm - such as using a different forms of disease control, alternative varieties, making decisions about timing of fungicide and pesticide applications, and a range of other processes. 
Key words: barley integrated disease management, agricultural innovation, social network analysis. Key stakeholders: Barley growers, maltsters, buyers, whisky producers, input suppliers, barely breeders, chemical manufacturers, barley researchers, policy makers</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The excepted benefits would be improved uptake of barley management practices which will reduce reliance on pesticides (with associated benefits to the environment) and improve yield and quality through the following results:-
Improved stakeholder knowledge of up to date research in the barley sector through participation in two workshops where research output on barley IDM are presented, and the barriers to behaviour change are explored. The stakeholder group will also have access to an online forum where they can continue to interact. 

Improved communication with other members of the barley AIS through direct contact during facilitated workshops as well as post workshop interactions with the research team and the AIS. 

A significant benefit of this proposal is that there will be a fuller understanding of the barriers that exist and the motivations required for behaviour change which apply to the various stakeholders, as well as the individual, social and material context which must be understood so that behaviour change can be supported and subsequent KT tailored to suit these preferences and barriers.

The ability to be part of the process of designing interventions which meet their specific needs and are not top down. This co-production of interventions should enhance legitimacy of the interventions, and ensure they are designed with the specific needs of the stakeholders at the centre of the intervention. 

Delivery of at least three interventions to support behaviour change within the barley AIS and support improved management of barley disease management. These will be grounded in the process, however, examples might include the management of data between stakeholders such as input suppliers or retailers back to farm through interfaces such as a mobile application, providing in-depth training and support to key actors within the AIS and supporting them to disseminate that information to peers, if for example we identify opinion leaders or 'early adopters' who are influential within the AIS. Other examples of interventions based on SNA in other disciplines include identifying antagonistic actors who do not support the new approach and engaging with them to either enable them to see the benefits, or understand the nature of the barrier they present. Using SNA to identify 'bridges' which link sub groups of stakeholders, and therefore are crucial to spreading information, and supporting them in that role. 

Access to the barley AIS on future issues. The barley AIS will be a sustainable network of stakeholders who will be facilitated in continuing their interactions so that further research outputs can be disseminated, as well as information about barriers they face fed back into the design of future research programmes, such as those research packages this proposal is based on. The network will be supported through on going processes relating to monitor farm activities, agronomy conferences, trial open days, crop protection reports and other industry groups such as a proposed barley 'hub' - a proposal discussed with SRUC and JHI in conjunction with industry stakeholders at previous meetings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35430</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This short video took the discussions from the workshops held as part of the project, as well as identifying experts from the knowledge network created, and interviewed them based on the topics Barley growers felt they needs to know more about, or were unsure of in relation to IPM.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D469B119-D66F-4E86-AC9E-8F25D7F92971</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is yet to be measured but views and comments will be monitored to assist with measuring uptake.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>591466a9f2ac66.26586296</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>IPM Barley short film</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The workshops and follow up stakeholder contact supported by this award has resulted in the collection of data concerning the knowledge network associated with Integrated Pest Management of Barley in Scotland. This has been analysed to produce a Knowledge Network map using Social Network Analysis mapping soft wear. This award has also allowed a behaviour change model to be explored by stakeholders which has produced information on the individual, social and material contexts which influence behaviour across the barley supply chain. 
The key discoveries from this award are to identify the key experts on IPM in Barley and to use these experts to provide clarity to the supply chain as to the definition of IPM and what the implications are for growers, to identify organisations which are not intergraded into the knowledge network and help to improve their knowledge exchange to the supply chain, and to identify key barriers to behaviour change in this area.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A report on the behaviour change model findings will be disseminated to stakeholders and key policy makers.
