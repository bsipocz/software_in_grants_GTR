Following the 'subsidy revolution' (Elliott 1997), which granted youth-based participatory arts activities greater prominence in the UK since the late 1990s, questions about the value of such activities, and the most appropriate ways of understanding their outcomes, have been raised from a number of quarters (see, e.g., Belfiore, 2002, 2004; Merli 2002; Belfiore and Bennett 2008, Galloway 2009). Indeed, for many commentators, the growing emphasis on assessing and evaluating what have been termed the 'instrumental' outcomes of young people's arts participation risk ignoring what are, for most participants, the very aspects of the participatory encounter which serve to motivate them to engage in the first place: its 'intrinsic' value as arts activity.

This project seeks to contribute to recent debates urging the need to transcend the 'instrumental' vs 'intrinsic' impasse (Knell &amp;amp; Taylor 2011) by exploring the ways in which cultural value is understood by stakeholders involved in one novel participatory youth-focussed and music-based initiative currently developing in England: In Harmony-Sistema England. Our choice of this initiative offers a particularly fascinating case for exploration because, where most attempts to link music to forms of social good have employed popular music forms (as part of an effort to appeal to the disadvantaged young people with whom they work), In Harmony-Sistema England, taking its lead from the highly successful Venezuelan El Sistema initiative, adopts an orchestral model and engages young people using the 'high art' form of classical music. While the El Sistema model explicitly invokes the intrinsic dimensions of musical activity as a means of engendering growth and development in participating individuals, it does so with the conscious intention of generating spill-over effects which register at the level of what have been elsewhere termed 'instrumental' outcomes. Yet prioritised throughout projects' activities are those explicitly artistic goals and achievements which serve to motivate young people's participation. While the project has seen great achievements in Venezuela, it remains the case that relatively little is understood, within scholarly circles, about the transformative components of the programme and the ways in which participants' valuation of the cultural dimensions of the project translate into other kinds of (broader) effects.

In recognition of the different models of delivery and project partnership currently involved in the different incarnations of In Harmony-Sistema England, as well as the importantly differing local cultural conditions and subjective understandings of cultural value brought by different participants and stakeholders, this project will engage with the concerns sketched above by exploring three different In Harmony projects, located across England.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is designed to impact directly upon the evidence-base that informs cultural policy. In particular, it will allow those responsible for initiatives like 'In Harmony-Sistema England' to understand their success. It will do this in four ways. 

First, the project will offer a particular approach to the understanding and measurement of 'cultural value', one that negotiates the - often unproductive - dichotomy of 'intrinsic' and 'instrumental' value. 

Secondly, the project will provide findings based upon this alternative approach. By interviewing participants of 'In Harmony-Sistema England' projects, it will illustrate how project participants, teachers and others understand the benefits that have been derived from the initiative. 

Thirdly, the project will compare different forms of the 'In Harmony-Sistema England' initiative. This will allow us to comment on how the cultural value attributed to 'In Harmony-Sistema England' projects varies according to the factors which distinguish one project from another (e.g., geographical location and local cultural conditions; make-up of participating groups and host communities; nature of project delivery partnership and participating institutions; involvement of broader community beyond IHSE participants; mode, intensity and duration of project participation). 

Finally, through the theoretical and conceptual advancements made in approaching questions of 'cultural value', the research project will feed into the community arts evaluation literature, thereby connecting with wider debates about the value of community-based arts interventions and their potential effectiveness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Presentation of Research Findings - Understanding the Cultural Value of In Harmony- Sistema England</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A198E083-8692-4462-95D4-768A95F9EEB0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk produced discussion and questions

A Chameleonic Practice 
? There remains no agreed definition of CM and a number of recent developments appear to have stretched already-catholic understandings of CM into a further expanded form. 
? Adopting a broad definition of CM enables a sense of unity across the profession and provides practitioners with the flexibility to tailor their CM activity to the requirements tied to different sources of funding. We therefore enountered resistance to engaging with questions about what CM is. Instead, delegates sought to retain an understanding of CM as a 'chameleonic practice', capable of responding to shifting policy and funding agendas. 
? Problematically however, this situation risks obscuring the aims underpinning CM activity, thereby leading to challenges in clearly communicating the value of CM to external constituencies.

Mythologies of Practice 
? There appears to be a degree of 'myth making' around understandings of intent, process and impact in CM activity. This occurs, it seems, in order to maintain as open as possible a view as to how initiatives might achieve outcomes. 
? However, given the opportunity, many delegates would prefer a more robust, distinct and accountable identification of CM principles and practices. 
? With the National Lottery came the combination of significantly increased resources and apparent political interest in the area of CM. Yet this development created tensions for many in CM, as the personal development aspects of the work became less valued and policy-driven outcome objectives (particularly in terms of social inclusion and employability) became more pronounced.
? CM interests, purposes and practices (motivated by an ethos and informed by an ethical framework), should not only be situated in an understanding of the present operational context but also informed by an appreciation of the history of CM as an emancipatory practice. Explicit in this is the need for constructs of CM that confuse such a purpose - what we might call 'mythologies' - to be actively discouraged. 

Quiet Radicalism 
? CM has traditionally claimed to draw on 'radical', 'activist' or broadly 'political' motivations. We found little evidence of this in delegates' accounts of contemporary practice. Rather, delegates provided accounts of how CM practice has come to accommodate itself to - and position its value in relation to - the agendas of formal service providers (in education, health and social services). 
? This was figured as 'quiet radicalism'. Here CM practitioners meant that their approach was influencing the work of providers of other (primarily social and educational) services across a diversity of contexts.
? Yet the values of CM, closely allied to what are sometimes termed 'informal education processes', sit uneasily, in certain ways, with the objectives, measures and approaches typically to the fore within, for example, formal educational settings. 
? Some delegates were keen to draw attention to the ways work undertaken within certain settings and with certain agencies, threatened to undermine some of the core concerns of CM practice. 
? One question which emerged concerned the extent to which CM risks - in the course of its various accommodations, strategic re-configurations and adaptations - divesting itself of those elements and attributes capable of yielding the kinds of personal, social, cultural or community-level benefits which fall outside of the remit of its current funders' scope of interest. 

Quality, evidence, and faith
? We encountered contested understandings of quality, evidence, and evaluation. This was reflected in discussions about 'excellence,' and differing views about the relative importance of 'process' and 'product.' Since it was unclear what was meant by 'quality', it was difficult to know what sorts of evidence might be sought to prove value. 
? Where can we look for reliable, non-partial accounts of the results of an intervention? Capturing these is likely to be expensive in proportion to the cost of delivering interventions; and would require sophisticated data collection and analysis before and after the event.
? Stories and anecdotes are commonly used to provide accounts of successful practice, but the storytellers are often implicated in the project delivery - and commissioning - and so have a vested interest in the stories having a happy ending.
? It appears to be important to distinguish between outcomes that are 'measurable' and what delegates noted as 'important' 
? There seems to be a risk of confusing evaluation with advocacy. Evaluation should be independent and neutral, carrying a risk of uncovering failure; whereas advocacy is all about presenting the best possible case, and, if necessary, suppressing bad news.
? Much/most work is commissioned based on the hope/belief that something good will come of it. This faith, ideally, is shared by all parties to the activity.

Pathways to an elusive consensus 
? We encountered a persistent difficulty in drawing together the views of participants into a consistent, coherent account of CM and its activities and practices. The only consistency lay in the diversity of experience. The reluctance to be defined functions as a more or less deliberate strategy for keeping artistic, and most importantly commercial, options open.

The Role of Research 
? Considerable methodological difficulties thwart attempts to quantify the outcomes of participation in CM activity. Much of the research carried out to date has been considered anecdotal and has been criticised by commentators for its lack of robustness. 
? CM appears to lack either the terminological or pedagogical specificity through which to explain its processes to the uninitiated. As a consequence, potentially valuable dimensions of its practice and outcomes are often not effectively communicated to wider constituencies. 
? The field's longstanding resistance to definition and articulation appears to play into the current lack of understanding - both from within and without - of the core processes and mechanisms used in CM.
? The current lack of precise and clear analyses of the processes and mechanisms enacted within CM projects, and of the ways these variably connect with different outcomes in different contexts, therefore leaves the field unable to offer anything but an underspecified accounts of its benefits. 
? This challenge appears to be an especially important matter at a time when questions about the delivery of 'value' are - from the point of view of funders and policy makers alike - more pressing than ever.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings might be taken up by a range of agencies and bodies, including community music advocacy organisations (such as Sound Sense), community music activity funding bodies (such as National Foundation for Youth Music), community music training providers as well as feeding into cultural policy makers' decisions and expectations regarding community music.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A968264E-40BB-4A30-B34B-93EB04150950</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d59a253ffb00.76353286</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>72E260A2-FEDD-418D-92FD-2169ED5A0EE5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding the Cultural Value of In Harmony-Sistema England</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c232da12cc7211e1684ce5631b75cb8b"><gtr:id>c232da12cc7211e1684ce5631b75cb8b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rimmer, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463adb1a45af9.67485053</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>42FED5D4-6802-4051-B33B-07A60691444C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Music, middle childhood and agency: The value of an
