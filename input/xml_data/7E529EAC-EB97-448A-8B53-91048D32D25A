This trend has accelerated to the point where a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean is expected in the next decades. This represents an unprecedented change in scale and speed of sea ice-melt, unique for at least millennia, and also possibly in the history of human civilisation.

The impacts of melting sea-ice are predicted to be wide-ranging, from alterations in the distribution of local terrestrial and marine fauna and flora, to changes to the earth's climate systems and ocean circulatory patterns: large shifts in the distribution of marine fauna and plankton, reductions in the habitat of key species such as the polar bear, or an enhanced Arctic-mid-latitudes climate connection responsible for colder winters in Europe are amongst these impacts. Sea ice is a key part of Arctic climate and ecology. Its white surface acts as a mirror for the incoming solar rays, which are largely reflected back into space, instead of penetrating the ocean and getting trapped in our planet. Sea ice loss increases the amount of heat entering our planet, further accelerating warming. Sea ice melt also creates great volumes of freshwater, interfering with the global oceanic circulation. Arctic sea ice loss thus plays a big role in further warming the Arctic (which warms much faster than lower latitudes). This enhances plant growth, causing large changes in the tundra. Plus, many plants and animals have evolved in landscapes with sea ice that are now changing. The consequences of this for animals such as the polar bear, the Arctic fox, Arctic whales and seals, and Arctic plants remain poorly understood.

The anticipated large effects on climate and ecology are to date largely unquantified, due to the fact that Arctic biologists and climatologists are confronted with scarce and short information of past environmental conditions. The compilation of long environmental records for the Arctic would allow testing many questions about the effects of a rapidly changing environment. A much needed long (covering thousands of years) record of sea ice conditions for the whole Arctic is thus lacking.The aim of the proposed project is to produce it to answer key questions with direct implications for our society, namely: how changes in Arctic sea ice affect the global climate and the high latitude biota, and what can we learn from this for the future?

Past sea ice conditions are inferred from the analysis of material collected in the Arctic that constitutes evidence of past sea ice presence or absence (sea ice proxies). This material consists of molecules and microscopic organisms in dated sediment at the bottom of the ocean, ice cores and tree rings affected by sea ice, scars made by ice on beaches, and animal and plant remains like whale bones or driftwood. This project proposes a collaborative effort to combine all this information and produce a full Arctic picture of past sea ice dynamics.

Of all sea ice proxies, driftwood is the only one informing not only of past sea ice condition, but also of the drift routes sea ice took to deliver driftwood from the moment it entered the ocean to the moment it got deposited on Arctic beaches. Since the Arctic is so cold, driftwood is well preserved for more than 10,000 years. Existing material will be analysed using new techniques that can inform with improved precision about past sea ice extent and drift routes. Arctic expeditions will be organized to collect new material for key regions and periods.

This will help the scientific community to answer questions about the role of sea ice in Arctic climate and biology and its global consequences. It will also put current changes in a larger framework and improve our understanding of the effects that this huge environmental change will have on our planet, which is what I find most important and exciting about this research proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Arctic sea ice decline constitutes one of the most dramatic environmental processes on Earth ever witnessed by humankind, and the questions tackled by this project are especially timely within the current context. Being able to test an understand in a quantitative way hypotheses concerning the effects of changing sea ice to regional climate and ecology will potentially benefit not only Arctic researchers, but also will provide basic information for conservation strategies in the area and for a number of policy actors. Beneficiaries from this project will be:

1. Academic beneficiaries: ranging from a wide spectrum of disciplines, these will benefit from the conclusion of this research project but also by the use they will make of the databases produced during its completion. Please refer to 'Academic Beneficiaries' and 'Case for Support' sections of this proposal for further information on this.

2. Industry: large resource-extractive industries (both non-renewable - mining, oil and gas, and renewable - fisheries) will greatly benefit from the deeper understanding of the effects a decline on sea ice will have on several taxa (including marine and terrestrial mammals, fish, marine molluscs, vascular plants, lichens, birds, or plankton) and on key weather events relevant for the transport and infrastructure development in the area.

3. Local communities: results from this research project will provide local communities with new and improved tools to plan the future warmer Arctic, and to strengthen and concrete their claims.

4. Local/regional/international governments and NGOs: a deep understanding of the long-term relationships between sea ice and the Arctic biota and climate provide extremely useful planning tools to devise adaptive strategies under a series of scenarios.

Project results, aimed at being disseminated through the development of multiple deliverables (Peer-reviewed papers, Academic conferences, Summary for policy makers, a Webpage, and a Video - please read 'Pathways to Impact'), aim to contribute to a more resilient Arctic planning and conservation, as well as to a more realistic picture of the actual climatic and ecological effects of the current sea ice decline in the Arctic. The time frames for this effect are within the next few years to few decades, potentially aiding to attain better future adaptability of societies and Arctic biota. The would as well contribute to placing British polar science in an agenda-setting position.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>530018</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Lapland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Finland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Arctic Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Tundra shrub material sharing</gtr:description><gtr:id>350B3D2C-020C-4156-A83F-D152666DF601</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several publications in the past.

The press release, led by Climate Central, named &amp;quot;Climate change causes record warmth at Santa's home&amp;quot;, and with the collaboration of researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Melbourne, as well as the Dutch Meteorological Service, was featured on worldwide media outlets just before Christmas and my part in it was to explain the effects of sea ice on extreme weather events leading to reindeer mortality. The piece was also featured in &amp;quot;The Conversation&amp;quot; by a member of the team. Among the many news it generated, I share in here the link to Time, which included a video: http://time.com/4616520/arctic-warm-winter-humans-climate-change/
Such news should have a clear impact on the way society perceives climate change and its effects. Their impact is difficult to measure but the magnitude of the attention it generated beyond academy was large. A paper stemming from such study is planned, with imminent submission (Spring 2017).

2015
One of the three publications directly linked to the award this year is a Chapter on ecosystem services in the Arctic for which I am the lead author and which belongs in a document commissioned by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Arctic Council (a high-level intergovernmental forum that addresses issues faced by the Arctic governments and the indigenous people of the Arctic. It has eight member countries: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States).

The chapter gives an overview of the ecosystem services provided by nature in the Arctic and addresses their status, trends, and knowledge and data gaps. This report (http://arcticteeb.net) was presented at the 2015 Arctic Council ministerial meeting held in Canada, which counted with the presence of high-profile representatives from the 8 Arctic countries, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

Although I am unable to specify how these findings will be used in policy-relevant action at the moment, their discussion and presence in such an event is relevant beyond academia and span full societal aspects in the Arctic. The award holder will track future impacts of this kind of actions closely. Such types of actions were explicitly stated in the NERC IRF plan.

A website has been designed highlighting Polar Research at the University of Oxford (www.polar.ox.ac.uk). This is one of the initial objectives of my NERC IRF project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>952CC4B1-DB21-4C74-8C98-2C2A5B0C8209</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e078dc88fe73.41644077</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>2016
Key findings/milestones during the last 12 months (the second of the 5yr IRF):
1. Fieldwork
Two 8-day expeditions to the Svalbard Archipelago were done in the summer of 2016, with ~100 new pieces of driftwood collected. PhD student Georgia M. Hole attended one of these expeditions. A major expedition is planned for 2018. The summer of 2017 will be devoted to visiting Canada and the USA to resample and analyse existing driftwood collections.

2. Methodological advances
Nitrogen isotopic work has been successfully applied to tundra shrubs (for the first time) and full chronologies depicting Nitrogen availability by tundra vegetation or the 20th century have been developed. Nitrogen isotope chronologies can be used to infer nutrient status through time and space of tundra vegetation. Andrew Martin (the PhD student developing this work) plans to use oxygen isotope ratios as well to reconstruct snow depth and provenance using the same shrub material. This has involved the building of newly equipment - explained above. Moreover, a review on controls on tundra shrub growth has gone through several drafts already and should soon be submitted.
 
3. Edition of a Special Issue - Biology Letters (Royal Society Publishing)
Finalised, expect for one remaining paper. More than 15 papers published altogether. 

4. Research outcomes
A. Rain-on-snow during winter with a return to freezing temperatures in the tundra can form a thick layer of ice that cause reindeer starvation due to their inability to access the lichens and grasses underneath the snow layer. Such events can be catastrophic. We found links between the occurrences of this events in the Yamal Peninsula of Siberia and sea ice conditions in the Barents and Kara Seas. Results were published in Biology Letters in 2016.

B. Tundra productivity and sea ice: a study based on remote sensing data from Svalbard has been finalised and led by Marc Macias-Fauria. The study shows very clearly that the influence of sea ice on tundra productivity depends on the distance and quantity of sea ice to the shore during the growing season, and that such coupling can be broken of sea ice is absent or away from the shore in this key period of the year. The study has been submitted and is currently under peer review.

C. A map of biomes for Northern Eurasia was produced using an extensive network of fossil pollen for the region, showing changes in biome distribution from 21ka to the present (i.e. from the last glacial maximum to the present). This work was published in Quaternary Science Reviews.

2015
Key findings/milestones during the last 12 months (the first of the 5yr IRF):
1. Fieldwork
A successful field trip to Nordkapp in northernmost Norway to collect driftwood samples to be used in methodological developments. Plus, a field trip to northern Finland to collect tundra shrub material to be used in dendrochronology.

2. Methodological advances
Three out of the four initial proposed methodologies to determine the provenance of arctic driftwood (which gives information on past sea ice occurrence and movement) have been successfully tested and shown to work: dendrochronology, wood anatomy, and radiogenic isotopes. Of these, radiogenic isotopes had never been applied to driftwood. Radiogenic isotopic work has been performed partly in collaboration with Prof Don Porcelli's team at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford. The fourth method (ancient DNA extraction) will be tested during the current month, in collaboration with the &amp;quot;Palaeobarn&amp;quot; research team at the University of Oxford, led by Prof Greger Larson.

Nitrogen isotopic work has also been successfully applied to tundra shrubs (for the first time) and full chronologies depicting Nitrogen availability by tundra vegetation or the 20th century will soon be developed.
 
3. Edition of a Special Issue - Biology Letters (Royal Society Publishing)
One of the objectives of the 5yr project is the edition of two special issues in international peer-reviewed journals. The one on the coupling between sea ice and Arctic biota is fully under way at the Royal Society journal Biology Letters. It counts with over 20 contributions (all research-based papers on the topic) and it will be published before the end of 2016. A session on the topic was organised at the 2015 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, convened by Marc Macias-Fauria and Eric Post (Penn State, USA). 

4. Research outcomes
Intense work has been done on the impact of climate change on the tundra ecosystem. Two high-profile publications have resulted, one in Nature (co-led by Marc Macias-Fauria), which identifies the tundra ecosystem as a hotspot of sensitivity to climate globally, and another one in Nature Climate Change, which focuses on the finer grain sensitivity of the tundra biome to climate change. More publications re being prepared on this topic, which tackle sea ice directly (at least two more high-profile publications are expected or 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The methodological advances will most probably be applied by many other researchers once they are published and made available to the research community.

The Biology Letters special issue on the coupling between Arctic biota and sea ice is the first compilation on this topic and should be very highly cited. It will serve as a key reference to have if one aims at understanding the wide range of ways in which these systems are interlinked.

The published material has had high impact in the research community and beyond, having been reported by international outlets such as the BBC, the New York Times, or the Washington Post, among many others.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6700F7C7-1792-4F3C-BAAC-620A9F1DB53B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e07e756b6087.15761126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation of publication on an intergovernmental ministerial meeting (Arctic Council)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E9647794-C2EA-48E6-A4B1-7298150210D1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0971971c947.90802668</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://arcticteeb.net</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>An extensive and comprehensive search for already existing Arctic driftwood material has been undertaken.
