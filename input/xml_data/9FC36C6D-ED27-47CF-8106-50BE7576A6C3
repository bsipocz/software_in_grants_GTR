Although pastoralists are socio-economically important segment of the population, they are subjected to harsh environment and extreme poverty with poor infrastructure and social services. As a result pastoralists have poor health status with high infant, child and maternal deaths. Cognizant of the challenges and socioeconomic importance, there have been continental and national efforts to improve the livelihoods of pastoral people. Ethiopia introduced a community-based Health Extension Program (HEP) in the pastoral areas to address the poor health status and achieve equitable health outcomes. The HEP model, which was originally designed and piloted in 2004 for adaption to the context of the agrarian sedentary population, was introduced into pastoral areas with minor adjustments on human resource taking into account the cultural context, language and scarcity of high-school graduates.
Although there has been a significant improvement in the performance of the health system in the country, the impact has been less successful in the pastoral areas demonstrating that the adaptation of the HEP model to pastoral areas was not based on adequate consideration to the local context. We propose to follow the following steps to develop an appropriate public health interventions for pastoral settings: 1) description of the local context including existing health systems; 2) selection of potential interventions; 3) testing interventions (feasibility, acceptability and efficacy); 4) formulation of appropriate public health intervention; 5) implementation at a scale; and 6) monitoring effectiveness and adequacy. 
The purpose of this 'development grants' proposal is to address the first two steps, which will be used to develop a well-informed research project (moving forward through the steps) for submission to the 'full-scale research project grants'. We aim to describe the morbidity patterns, characterize the context and identify health determinants, and address the question as to what are the most appropriate interventions for pastoral areas. We will describe the wider context and barriers to service delivery to inform the design of strategies that ensure acceptability and service utilization addressing the question as to how to most effectively delivery health interventions building on existing structures. We will also explore existing venues that are potentially adaptable for service delivery in the pastoralist setting and address the question as to how to most effectively delivery health interventions using existing social events and services.
The study will be conducted in Borona zone, Oromia region. It will involve documentation and analysis of contextual factors and existing health services. The research will employ basic epidemiological study based on health facility records and registers, and community level surveys. Behavioral and social processes that put the pastoralist community at high risk will be described through qualitative study. Process evaluation will be conducted through case-study approach to thoroughly examine the underlying context at various levels of implementation and stakeholders using key informant interviews and Community Focus Group Discussions. The designing process of potential health interventions will involve community participation, adoption of innovative and adaptive approaches, and consider cultural sensitivity.
The study will contribute to achieving equitable health outcomes and the MDGs in Ethiopia and beyond, and to ensure the widest use of the research findings, we aim to establish a collaborative partnership involving policymakers and relevant stakeholders. Results of the research will be communicated through presentations in national and international conferences, publications, the Internet, and mass media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>To address the high child and maternal mortality rates, Ethiopia introduced a community-based Health Extension Program (HEP) in the pastoral areas. Despite this initiative the impact has been less successful demonstrating that the adaptation of the HEP model did not consider the pastoral context. We aim to describe the pastoral context in terms of the morbidity patterns, identifying risk factors and health determinants, and address the question as to what are the most appropriate intervention packages for pastoral areas. We also aim to describe the wider context and barriers to service delivery and explore existing venues that are potentially adaptable for service delivery in the pastoralist setting addressing the question as to how to most effectively delivery health interventions building on existing structures and social events. We also aim to use this information to identify possible interventions for the pastoral context. The ultimate objective of this 'development grants' project is to provide information for the development of a well-informed research project for submission to the 'full-scale research project grants' with the aim of testing potential interventions and formulating appropriate public health intervention.

A collaborative partnership involving policymakers and relevant stakeholders will be established to ensure the widest use of the research findings.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>a) Policy makers/Managers/Health workers: 
First, there will be knowledge relevant to policy and practice on the distribution of morbidity, health and health care behavior, implementation of HEP and beneficiary perception that will be available immediately. This knowledge will be used to change their decision-making and service delivery practices. Second the proposed research will develop and implement innovative service delivery model and provide knowledge on cost and delivery strategies. This will address policymakers' knowledge needs on the delivery and financing of health services and will enable them to use it make policy and practice changes in the delivery of innovative HEP to pastoralists and development of implementation and delivery guidelines for use by health workers. 

b) NGOs and Civil associations
There will be findings that are relevant to policy-related work of NGO Beneficiaries globally, nationally and regionally that are concerned with promotion of pastoralist development and health. They can easily embed this knowledge in their policy and health program activities. For example policy forums to which NGOs contribute and health service delivery activities in which the NGOs are involved. For instance, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO can make the findings available to their health programs and influence service delivery policy through their policy forum.

c) Pastoralist Community and community organizations
The third main category of user for our research relates to groups such as traditional clans leaders, pastoralist community associations, traditional medical practitioners, the participant community beneficiaries. We will seek to contribute here to bringing community perspective and actively engaging them will form an essential part of our research soliciting their advice, contributions and feedback at all stages ensuring community empowerment and ownership.

Social Impact
Traditional clans who have strong influence and well acceptance and trust from their respective communities will get engaged and play the role of mediators on avoidance of risky health behaviors and promotion of access to health care services. .This study will document and mobilize the influence of the clan heads in solving local challenges for the government to consider the traditional approaches to get things done. Such input of the local communities will be critical to the implementation of the envisioned innovative health services strategy which focuses on improving acceptability of health services, health promotion and prevention measures by the pastoralist community resulting in improved access to and utilization of quality health services that would lead to reduction in morbidity, mortality and disability and promote health.

Economic Impact
There are several areas in which the economic impacts of this research project can be expected both in terms of overall economy and cost-effectiveness of the health system. This is because a healthy community reduces pressure on existing health system, also reduces inequalities and means that pastoralist community can be productive fully employed in the pastoral economy, which increases gross domestic product, generates higher incomes for citizens, and increases tax revenues for the government. Healthier people also possess greater physical and mental energy this indirectly enable pastoralist people to take their education further and equipping them to better manage their own health and use healthcare facilities more effectively. Another economic benefit would be the employment benefit from community members that would result from the implementation of the new adapted PHC model for pastoralists. There is also anticipation that the introduction of mobile phone technology for health service delivery that would have an added value to improving efficiency in service delivery and the improved market for the commercial sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>119638</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oromia Regiona Health Bureau</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ethiopia, Federal Democratic Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership for pastoral community engagement</gtr:description><gtr:id>54149024-BE70-41D2-B2DB-B8F1F194B406</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaborative research proposal entitled &amp;quot;Formative evaluation of networks of health development army to improve immunization coverage in pastoral communities of Ethiopia&amp;quot;; was developed by the collaborating organizations.

Their increased interest and commitment has facilitated the engagement of the key stakeholders at Borena zone level.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda31e224484.43373724</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>Pre-2006,2006</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C697C7E1-ED40-44CC-B866-AA6E10376C1F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Key stakeholders that were identified during the project proposal development process as well as other stakeholders identified during the implementation period were contacted and engaged in the project. Eight major stakeholders were engaged. These included Zonal level offices: Pastoralist Development Office, CARE Ethiopia, GOAL Ethiopia, Women Affairs, Women Federation, Women Association, Education Office and various district health offices. The research team and members of the regional and zonal health offices visited the offices of the various stakeholders for meeting with managers and key members of the stakeholders. A total of 20 managers and members attended the meetings and discussed about the project and what each stakeholder can contribute to the project implementation. All the stakeholders (governmental and non-governmental) agreed upon having evidences from the project for adjusting health program implementation in the pastoral area and ensured their continued support in the process.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58caae3951c9d0.24976386</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2006</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>199427</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Innovations in Increasing Immunisation Thematic Window</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>TW10.1076</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>033826CB-6DED-4DD7-8966-92EC3AFA1F14</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d7284734f2a3.69831280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evaluation of Health Extension Program</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>495BFF5F-C920-42B7-8CCA-4EE422C24B98</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca7759aadcb6.18628630</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The intervention is called Health Development Army (HDA). It is a broad-based community mobilization platform, which involves grouping 20-30 households who reside in the same sub-locality into development teams, and then, each team is organized into one-to-five networks of six households living in the same neighborhood. The members of the networks are women. This intervention approach was conceived as a result of the MRC funded project. During the initiation stage of our project, our research team was involved in stakeholder engagement activities to create awareness of the objectives and methodology of the research project. During these multiple discussions with various key stakeholders in Borena zone, in addition to the inappropriateness of the existing Health Extension Program for pastoral context, another key challenge voiced by many was lack of community mobilization and participation affecting the pastoral health system. To address this challenge and strengthen community mobilization and ownership, we designed networks of women development army based on a similar approach designed for agrarian communities in Ethiopia. This community engagement approach is being subjected to formative evaluation through funding secured from the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie). The 3ie funding (PI: Hailay Desta Teklehaimanot) started in January 2016. At this stage, women have been organized into development teams and one-to-five networks. The leaders of the development teams and one-to-five networks have received training and equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to enable them influence their respective members on promotive and preventive health services. Draft intervention strategy has been developed, which will be followed by a series of evaluations and revisions to come up with the best community engagement approach for pastoral context. The health impact of the intervention approach will evaluated through the measurement of pre- and post-intervention immunization coverage. The pre-intervention household survey has already been undertaken prior the implementation of the intervention.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A5E53DD-CC6F-49BC-8CC8-1CA4B8911CDB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>While the intervention is being subjected to formative evaluation and before the project is completed, the Zonal Health Department and Zonal Women Affairs have started to implement the intervention in all villages of the zone.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0794b70f752.93079178</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Community engagement</gtr:title><gtr:type>Health and Social Care Services</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2016</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The public health intervention under development is a primary health care strategy for pastoral community, which is the main objective of the research project.
