The mass production of texts was impossible, and a work could survive only if someone wanted to read it and thereby went to the trouble of finding or making a copy. In the time of Charlemagne most copying took place close to the Rhine and the centre of his empire. In the High Middle Ages most copying took place in France, and Paris emerged as the centre of the learned world. In the Renaissance Italy replaced France, and first Florence and then Rome were the most important centres of learning. In general, far more copying took place in the fifteenth century than in previous centuries. I study the process by which eight works of literature (Curtius Rufus' Historia Alexandri Magni, Vitruvius' De Architectura, Porphyrio's commentary on Horace, Dictys' Trojan War, Cicero's speeches Pro Murena and Pro Sexto Roscio Amerino, and Cato's and Varro's treatises on agriculture) survived from antiquity until the first printed editions. This has led me to examine some 500 manuscripts and incunables (that is editions printed before 1500). Such a study has various uses. First, editors of these texts need to know which are the best manuscripts to use. One establishes the best manuscripts by looking at the errors shared by the manuscripts. This allows one to construct a stemma or family tree, and from a family tree it is often obvious which manuscripts need to be used by editors. In general, these manuscripts will have no surviving ancestors. This is the first systematic study of all the witnesses to these works, and for the first time it will allow a complete understanding of the various manuscript traditions. It will also allow the critical apparatus (that is the place below the text where editors cite manuscript readings) to be improved for all these authors, but most radically for Dictys, Cicero, and Curtius. My work on Curtius confirms a lesson already taught by others but sometimes ignored: editors should not ignore fifeenth-century manuscripts. Second, the process of the transmission of classical Latin texts from Antiquity to the Renaissance is an important and interesting subject in its own right. A consequence of the need for each text to be an individual copy is that some texts were not widely diffused. The general outlines of the process are well-known, but there is still much work to be done on the detail. No one read the speeches of Cicero that I study until c.1400, when a copy of them turned up at Cluny; this copy was carried off to Italy by the famous humanist Poggio Bracciolini, and I study the diffusion of the text in Italy. By contrast, of some fifty manuscripts of Cato and Varro only two were written outside Italy, and plainly these texts were hardly known in northern Europe before printing. Much of my work is concerned with this process of diffusion, especially in Italy. Third, manuscripts of classical Latin authors are studied also by e.g. paleographers, historians of culture, and art-historians. Scholars in these disciplines need to know where manuscripts were produced. In this my work can help. For given the difficult conditions under which texts spread it is likely that manuscripts of an author in a certain locality will share errors in common. This means that the genealogical families that my stemmata produce can often be used by e.g. art-historians to help in the localization of manuscripts. Many of the best results of recent research in the field have been achieved by paleographers and classicists making use of each other's expertise. This has led to an exciting transformation in our study of manuscripts, especially those of the Renaissance: no longer are manuscripts just impersonal artefacts represented on a stemma, but they can be related to a locality, and often to afigure of flesh and blood. I hope that my studies will help make further advances.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28373</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E003508/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>89068F3B-44C7-45D9-92CB-8BE148301439</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Reception</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
