This is because walking and cycling can improve the life chances and health and wellbeing of each city inhabitant -- irrespective of their socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, age -- with hardly any adverse impact on the lives of fellow inhabitants. Research on how walking and cycling in cities can be encouraged is burgeoning and provides many compelling insights. However, insights about the role of infrastructure in stimulating urban walking and cycling are limited because the focus is typically on the 'hardware' of cycle lanes, sidewalks, bike sharing schemes, road design, urban design and so forth; the 'software' of governance, regulation, information provision, maintenance and repair as well as the embedded knowledge, know-how, meanings, values, aspirations and emotions are not always given the emphasis they deserve. Moreover, the research is often set in cities in the global North and assumes insights and concepts that has emerged from there as universally valid and easily transferable to cities in the global South. 

This international research project will adopt a broader understanding of infrastructure and develop original empirical and theoretical insights on the basis of comparative research in the UK, the Netherlands and the state of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo in Brazil. The activities undertaken by the Oxford team focus on the role of community-led initiatives in London to encourage walking and cycling and in creating infrastructures that are conducive to these practices. The Oxford researchers will make an inventory of the heterogeneity of recent community-led initiatives in both cities, covering such issues as what they consist of, who are involved, what the goals are, and who benefits. The Oxford team will also critically evaluate if and how such initiatives can contribute to a large-scale transitio towards low-carbon urban mobility. A mixed-method approach consisting of document analysis, interviews and focus groups will be adopted, and the team will engage with local communities, policymakers, interest groups and other stakeholders in various ways. It can be expected that, apart from creating academic outputs, the project will contribute to: social learning among community-led initiatives through the sharing of experiences and good practices; to greater reflexivity about how policy, governance and regulation affect community-led initiatives; and to the creation of more effective support structures for such initiatives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a wide range of potential beneficiaries of the research. These can be divided into direct and indirect potential beneficiaries.

Direct potential beneficiaries include individuals and organisations who are involved in the project:
1| interviewed individuals with a leading role in community initiatives to encourage walking and cycling in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo
2| interviewed policymakers in both cities 
3| participants in the focus groups in the selected neighbourhoods in those cities
4| attendees representing community initiatives, walking and cycling interest groups, and the policy community in those cities
5| individuals and organisations included in the e-mail database that will be constructed and continually updated

Indirect potential beneficiaries are not directly involved in the project but may benefit from visiting the project website, from the policy and project briefings, or from the responses by direct beneficiaries to the project's engagement activities. These indirect potential beneficiaries include:
1| People, NGOs and businesses involved in community-led initiatives to encourage walking and cycling in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo (and not directly engaged by the project), in other cities and areas in the UK and Brazil, and in locations elsewhere
2| policymakers and transport planners at both national/state and local/city levels in the UK, Brazil, the Netherlands and elsewhere
3| walking and cycling interest groups and lobby groups in the UK, Brazil, the Netherlands and elsewhere
4| socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo 
5| pedestrians, cyclists and the general public in the UK, Brazil and the Netherlands

The identified stakeholders may benefit in various ways from the project. As detailed in the 'Pathways to Impact', they may develop a better understanding of what community-led initiatives there are in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, what benefits they generate and for whom, which challenges and barriers they face, and what thcontribution can be to a wider transition towards 'just' urban mobility. This knowledge may have a number of more specific effects. It may lead to:
- the diffusion and sharing of good practices (first-order learning) among grassroots initiatives to encourage walking and cycling;
- greater networking among such initiatives;
- greater reflexivity (second-order learning) among policymakers, planners and interest groups about how current policies and governance structures, including funding schemes and consultation/participation mechanisms, both facilitate and complicate/frustrate community-led initiatives;
- enhanced (government) support and reduced (regulatory) barriers for community-led initiatives; and
- greater knowledge about, and visibility of, community-led initiatives to encourage walking and cycling among pedestrians, cyclists and the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>265926</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Groundwork</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Informal collaboration with funder of grassroots organisations</gtr:description><gtr:id>19201DD2-C7F9-4475-A4CB-45E0AD39E637</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1417a70a3c7.23042297-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Prospective participant contact information was provided</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Stakeholder meetings and policy recommendations</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Transport for London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Informal collaboration with regional governmental transport organisation</gtr:description><gtr:id>D60E7EFE-2DEB-403A-B963-8A1EC4AFEBE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c14233f064c7.95524752-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Prospective participant contact information was provided</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Stakeholder meetings and policy recommendations</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Second stakeholder workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72EDB6AE-4B9D-4FB9-8D4C-78BAE9FE5FDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The second stakeholder workshop provided the opportunity for UK and London policy makers and walking and cycling third and private sector organisations, such as Transport for London, and Sustrans, to engage with preliminary findings, and steer subsequent research and engagement.

Our first two workshops at St. Luke's Community Centre (90 Central Street, London), one held on the 20th of April, 2016, and the other on the 13th of March, 2017, were opportunities to bring stakeholders-government decision makers from all levels, and representatives from grassroots walking cycling and intermediary organizations-into active participation with our research, helping to guide the direction of inquiry. The second workshop allowed us to share some of our preliminary findings with participants and collect interests in subsequent engagement and research activities. 
Similarly, fieldwork interviews running between September 2016 and March 2017 have offered an environment for knowledge exchange and reflexivity on the part of both the researcher and participants. For example, several participants articulated their appreciation of the way the interviews helped them re-conceptualize, and create new visions for, their respective organizations. Mention of findings from earlier interviews sometimes evoked responses from subsequent participants such as, &amp;quot;I had never thought about that way of attaining free bicycles, what a good idea.&amp;quot; In this way there was a cross-fertilization of ideas across the interviews performed.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7E35ADB7-8805-486D-9154-8B9C2B828554</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56b8a90c715b08.60074612</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project is a collaboration of researchers in the Universities of Oxford, Utrecht (the Netherlands) and Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the overall project seeks to answer the question of which features of the urban environment, governance of physical infrastructures and of local communities in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, The Netherlands, and/or United Kingdom influence walking and cycling and how can they be optimised to achieve sustainable urban mobility for all. The Oxford team focuses on grassroots innovations in infrastructures for urban walking and cycling in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo. It aims first to develop an inventory and typology of such innovations based on: which actors/actants are involved, and in what capacity; where they are in the city and their geographical scale of influence; and, what vision(s) on the 'good life' (collective wellbeing) and justice they embody. Secondly, it critically evaluates if and how these bottom up innovations can contribute to socially just transitions in urban mobility. 
Although not yet half-way through the three-year project, several objectives have thus far been met or exceeded. So far a database of over 150 largely active grassroots walking and cycling innovations in London, and their representatives' contact information. A typology of these organizations has also been created. This includes the nominal categories of Social Need, such as the cycle training needs of those with disabilities, or women's and gender variant individuals' need for bicycle maintenance training; Mode, namely walking, cycling, or both; Infrastructure, which might include cycle training, group walks, maintenance and repair, or signage and navigation; and, Organizational Type, such as charities, cooperatives, or social enterprises . So far over 30 interviews and 5 focus groups have been conducted in London and generated large quantities of qualitative data, a substantial portion of which has been transcribed and analysed. A map of the initiative locations, relative to the lower deciles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation and walking and cycling rates, has been produced. The database and map are not currently publicly available; this will be done when an academic paper on the topic has been completed and accepted for publication. We have also held two workshops in London, each with approximately 20 stakeholders from relevant organisations and policymakers. 
The walking and cycling grassroots innovations that we have so far investigated represent attempts to encourage environmentally friendly transport in ways that simultaneously attend to social inequities. That is, they are tailored by their originators or maintainers to fit the walking and cycling needs of otherwise overlooked and underserved communities such as low-income groups, ethnic or religious minorities, refugees and asylum seekers, those with physical, mental, or learning disabilities, women, gender variant individuals, and younger older &amp;quot;dependents.&amp;quot; They could also be said to support social learning and community cohesion. In this way they hold the potential to cultivate changes in the transport system that are not only more sustainable, but also more socially equitable. 
However, most of the organizations struggle to survive, particularly with respect to financial and human resources and work spaces. The initiatives they run thus flood and ebb over time. That said, the values, work and educational experiences, social networks, experimental risk taking, and often selfless dedication and care of the key actors make many projects surprisingly resilient.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Grassroots innovations may be supported, and their benefits maximized, through more and more long-term operational funding from national or local government, and protection through regulatory measures and tax shielding. Nonetheless, desire for upscaling, or identical replication, of any one project should not be assumed automatically. To do so would be to ignore the benefits of grassroots innovations that would be undermined or depreciated through growth that follows mainstream business models. It is perhaps then better to facilitate and assist grassroots project initiation, and then provide operational support regardless of aspirations for growth. However, rather than simply &amp;quot;transferring&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;plugging in&amp;quot; a universal, formulaic policy solution in all places and at all levels of government, each government body and/or funding agency will have to tailor supportive policy and funding requirements that attend to the uniqueness of the particular local contexts.
These findings have been shared with government decision-makers, grassroots organizations and intermediaries at the second stakeholder meeting. As the analysis continues and confidence in the findings' credibility and dependability increases, expanded versions of them will be published in the form of briefings and policy recommendations on the project website. A range of academic publications will further report on findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3FE77F25-F3BC-4C74-80C2-62738656338F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b8a8d6c1acc2.53838849</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Use of multiple, synchronised, digital audio recording devices with lapel microphones to simultaneously interview participants while performing activities in busy and sometimes noisy environments (e.g. during bicycle repair workshops).
