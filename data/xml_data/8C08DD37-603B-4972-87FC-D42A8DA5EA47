This has been a result of various factors. Firstly, 'positive' factors, such as the recognition of the rights of people with learning disabilities and changes in policy and service philosophies towards more 'self-directed' models. Secondly, the increasing pressures being placed on services: ageing populations, reduced resources, and competing priorities has led to changing thresholds of qualification for services, often removing people with mild and moderate levels of learning disability from service entitlement altogether. However, given that the very idea of 'learning disability' implies additional support needs, the removal of services for people currently considered 'learning disabled' throws into question what that status even means.&lt;br />&lt;br />In a series of three seminars, the team will:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>bring together researchers from a wide range of disciplines (history, geography, philosophy, psychology, sociology) to identify new ways of thinking about learning disability&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>share the outcomes of this seminar with people with learning disabilities and their families to shape a new agenda&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>engage with policy-makers to consider the implications for policy and practice.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The key purpose of the seminar series is to produce a new conceptual framework that will impact on three interrelated groups beyond academia: people with learning disabilities, their carers and families; service providers and social care professionals; and policy makers (including national and local government, and the third sector).

An evidence base dominated by essentialist approaches and, by implication, professional and planning practices derived therefrom, are inadequate for dealing with future challenges to service provision. The development of a 'contextual model' of learning disability, and dialogue with service providers, service users, and policy makers thereon, will assist them directly in responding to key economic and demographic challenges.

The seminars will not provide policy makers, service providers, or users with blueprints for the future of service provision, it is beyond our scope and purview to do so. What the series will do, however, is to help put that service planning process and the negotiations amongst those directly involved (policy makers, professionals, service users and carers) on a more rational and constructive footing. This will encourage more creative and innovative thinking in response to future challenges.

At present, concepts of learning disability locate it as a 'condition' within individuals, rather than a social status that is the outcome of highly contingent and contextual factors. Such notions of learning disability, and service ideologies, also fail to recognise its extremely historically, culturally and spatially mutable nature. Introducing these elements, in the form of the contextual model, allows for a greater recognition that future possibilities for service provision are more open and flexible than we might currently suppose. We will help policy makers, service providers, and users to think of different possible futures.

The seminar series will take place (2012-2013) in a period of sustained change in policy and financial frameworks in social care in the UK. The seminars will be extremely well placed to engage with the key actors and organisations in informing and shaping this new social care landscape to make it more suitable, responsive and effective for the needs of people with learning disabilities, their families and carers. 

The seminars will also provide an innovative forum for dialogue between people with learning disabilities, their families, service providers and policy-makers. The contextual model and the use of creative methods to stimulate discussion, particularly in seminar two, will help facilitate these new dialogues.

In addition, the series will have a number of other important impacts:

-Dialogues: Direct involvement of non-academic participants in the seminars, to co-produce with academic participants, a 'contextual model' of learning disability. Overall, the series will establish a new forum for dialogue and new networks between the various parties. 
-Blogging and social networking: Extension of the dialogues into the blogosphere and the use of social networking, to engage people with learning disabilities, professionals and service providers (use of separate virtual spaces for the different groups).
-Consultation and training: Potential end-users of the research can commission the project team to facilitate staff training and help with policy development drawing on the contextual model.
-Research futures: New more productive cross-disciplinary research links and opportunities, relevant to policy makers, service providers and people with learning disabilities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14955</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'Rethinking Learning Disability', reports on the whole seminar series, but particularly uses extracted segments from video-recordings of the presenters in Seminar 3.

A voice-over was provided by Johnnie Crossan, postgraduate student at the University of Glasgow. The video is available on the 'Wordpress site' rethinkinglearningdisability.net, linked to Seminar 3. The research team is exploring the possibility of creating DVDs of the video to send to key personnel in Scottish learning disability policy and practice. The anticipation is that the primary users will be: academics in the field of learning disability research and education; policy-makers in the Scottish (and perhaps wider) learning disability field; professionals and practitioners in the field; third sector and campaigning organisations in the field; and possibly people with learning disabilities and their families/guardians/advocates (especially for Seminar 2).</gtr:description><gtr:id>201FA4CA-9937-4360-B171-448C3EA03C80</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3538830590.93619789c9ee2e2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Rethinking Learning Disability</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Inform Theatre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Disability hate crime</gtr:description><gtr:id>B39FD9A5-C7AB-4AA0-B8D4-E636FFC0B3CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is ongoing at this point.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54650623622d43.41895322-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In conjunction with Dr Hall, Inform will work on the development of materials and performances designed to show the experience of hate crime as experienced by people with learning disabilities.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Dr Hall has continued the research partnership established with Inform Theatre Group for the Seminar Series in another project on disability hate crime.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Southern Cross University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Young people with cognitive disability: relationships and support</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A09552C-432E-473E-8F67-35115928602D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not yet at dissemination phase.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c53f300109.25516501-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Australian universities are the direct hosts of the research, which is an Australian Research Council Linkage Project.

The Scottish Observatory for Learning Disability was also initially established with an essentially 'health' focus, albeit broadly defined. Although serving as an important counter-point to the much more social and rights-based approach of the earlier Same as You? (2000), the findings of Rethinking Learning Disability stress the importance of not losing sight of wider issues. This was further reflected in concerns and issues generated in seminar two, by people with learning disabilities themselves, highlighting the importance of capturing people's lived experiences and the relevance for policy development.

The impact of this finding was already becoming clear in the concluding seminar. This included the participation of the primary civil servant behind the drafting of Keys to Life, the civil servant who will be taking forward the new policy programme, as well as Professor Anna Cooper, director of SOLD. At this event, a virtual dialogue was established with the findings of the first two seminars, and a new dialogue about taking forward key messages and findings - particularly around localisation and contextualisation - into policy and practice.

Professor Philo is now an Advisory Board Member of the Scottish Observatory for Learning Disability - directed by Professor Anna Cooper, a presenter at seminar three. This presence means that the 'contextual approach' to learning disability, central to the project, will be fed into the work of SOLD.

A further important, though unplanned, area of impact lay in the co-production methods involved, particularly in seminar two with Inform Theatre. This built an important and empowering bridge between the actors and the Universities. Dr Hall has continued his involvement with the group, using the approaches of the seminar series in a project on hate crime. Seminar two also produced benefits for the participants of Garvald Edinburgh, with Dr Hall had pre-existing contacts. Such links, especially involving bringing people with learning disabilities into the university, can bring important benefits in themselves, in terms of promoting social inclusion. In addition, the increasing use of co-productive approaches to research ensure that research agendas are consistent with the lives and aspirations of people with learning disabilities, and the process and findings also lead to tangible and meaningful improvements in the lives of individuals, families and communities.

For the Rethinking Learning Disability seminar series, therefore, there was no clear distinction to be made between the generation of research findings, knowledge exchange and impact. Although the balance shifted as the series progressed, all three seminars involved aspects of all three elements.
