For some, recovery has been achieved because economic growth is restored, albeit still relying on personal debt, consumer spending and asset-price inflation. For others, a continued dependence on finance-led growth is not recovery because there is no rebalancing away from the UK's dependence of finance and services toward manufacturing, creative industries or revitalizing the small and medium-sized enterprises. For still others, the very concepts of GDP growth, recession, and recovery are remnants of an old paradigm that cannot account for unpaid labour in the home, the ecological limits of growth, the realities of a global economy or the potential for technology to fundamentally change every day experiences of economic life. In short, recovery is a fundamentally free-floating concept with no inscribed a priori understanding of what it entails as a public policy or political objective. 
This seminars series moves the debate about the UK recovery forward by introducing an alternative 'discovery' framework. Over three years a mix of events will open-up a much needed dialogue that imagines alternatives to finance-led growth it Britain. They will promote interdisciplinary dialogue across the social sciences and create a platform for collaboration between academics and third-sector groups researching the UK economy. This offers new avenues for knowledge exchange with potentially exciting results. It is through dialogue with other researcher practitioners and stakeholder groups that new concepts, ideas and languages of progress are revealed. This multifaceted conversation will help to promote the viability of new voices offering alternative accounts of Britain's problems and new ways of thinking about how to solve them. 
Recovery does not speak for itself through strategically selected indicators of enhanced production or growth; rather it is something that needs to materialise in people's lived experience of 'the economy'. With this in mind we are able to discover new possibilities for economic, political and cultural innovation. We begin by challenging the established orthodoxy of equating 'recovery' with the end of recession-or, the UK economy producing more economic outputs in one quarter than in the previous quarter. We start with the questions have yet to find answers to: how to recover, how to grow, how to stabilise the economy? While including the social dynamics of uneven recovery: whose recovery, whose growth, whose economy? The 'how' speaks to traditional social science objectives of understanding problems and potentially offering solutions; the 'whose' makes space for rethinking of recovery/discovery as everyday practice. Overall exposing and questioning the political priorities embedded-often in an unspoken way-in 'the recovery' debates.
This makes charting the degree to which key concepts enable, shape or limit particular understandings of how the UK economy can move forward possible. For example, the orthodox use in the singular of concepts like recovery, growth, production, consumption and investment do not capture the differentiated experiences of economic life across gender, racial groups, generations, or regions within the UK. To think about a single recovery rather than multiple trajectories of often competing recoveries is therefore to silence some people's experience of economic life. We can already see that GDP growth can exist at the same time as a cost-of-living crisis because of the uneven (re)distribution of the burden of recession and gains from recovery, with women taking a particular heavy share of the costs while getting a smaller share of the benefits. Importantly, it is increasingly clear that we need a long-term solution to the environmental challenges that our current global economy creates. Addressing these problems requires more than just a return to growth and more extensive debate than the news or election cycle generally permits.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This seminar series creates a much-needed platform for engagement between academic and non-academic researchers to incubate new ideas and new ways of understanding the challenges to the UK economy. This research agenda has the potential to have wide-ranging political economic and policy implications that speak directly to social welfare and economic policy goals. Efforts to overcome orthodox understandings of growth and recovery will translate into novel and creative ways to combine the lived experience of growth and recovery with explicit policy goal such as gender equality, sustainability and competitiveness. 

The potential value of our programme of research seminars can be evidenced by the wide range of beneficiaries of participation in this project:

Civil society, advocacy groups, and trade unions: this series has the potential to influence organisational culture and practice within the various participating third sector groups, in particular those that develop their research and policy prescriptions into something that influences public debate, public policy or academic research. These groups will benefit from the collaborative platform that allows them to present and develop their policy positions and collaborate with academics in the co-production of a public interest report as well as digital content. Potential participants: War on Want, Oxfam, Trade Union Congress, GMB, UNITE, Citizens Advice Bureau, Violence Against Women Trust. 

Educational sector: the results of this seminar series have the potential to transform evidence-based education policy, professional practice or community service. In particular our mini-conference offers education professionals and volunteers the opportunity for information exchange through exploration of the pedagogical challenges of teaching on the economy in a rapidly changing globalized world. Potential participants: People's Political Economy, Post-Crash Economics Society, Economic Literacy Project.

Policymakers, regional and local authorities: public sector beneficiaries include policy makers working on national economic planning that are sympathetic to Andy Haldane's call for a fundamental re-thinking of finance-led growth among the political and policy elites. By hosting seminars in the North of the UK we can explicitly aim to address the geographical rebalancing of the UK economy; therefore, we will provide fruitful avenues for Regional and Local Authorities to engage in debates and benefit from our findings. Potential Participants: Lewisham and Lambeth Council, Sheffield council, South Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP).

Think tanks: research and advocacy institutes will work with us to develop innovative methods of knowledge exchange and/or co-production of outputs. Potential participants: NESTA, ippr, New Economics Foundation, Resolution Foundation.

Cultural commentators/press, general public: one aim of the project is to explore and translate jargon around discussions of austerity and the Recovery. The general public and the press will both benefit from exploration of an alternative language, one that brings down barriers to real communication about issues and reduces distance between the public and the economy. Potential participants: Aditya Chakrabortty (the Guardian); Carl Packman; Larry Elliot.

All the above will be invited to participate in various seminars offered as part of this series, in particular the two Collaborative Encounters Events. These events attempt to unpack the research process in ways that disrupt conventional representations of research as a linear, whilst at the same time posing questions about the authorship and ownership of knowledge production that are often otherwise foreclosed in conventional research. This method attempts to develop a collaborative model of cross-sector and interdisciplinary research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30356</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Recovery to Discovery (#RethinkRecovery) is a digital repository for all the collaborative and collective outputs generated as part of the ESRC Seminar Series 'From Recovery to Discovery'.

Key
questions included: Moving beyond orthodox indicators of labor market performance (such as unemployment and GDP), what evidence bases can be used to empirically analyze and capture the full set of labor market challenges? Since the economic crisis of 2008-2009, has labor unfreedom has intensified at the bottom end of the labor market? How have working conditions, remuneration, and collective bargaining rights been impacted for the low-waged workforce? The workshop generated new thinking about the overlaps and boundaries between forced labor, modern slavery and legal yet precarious forms of work.

The workshop was held at the Sheffield Town Hall on 26-27 May 2016. It was attended by twenty scholars and five expert labor market practitioners from across the UK and Europe. The public roundtable was attended by a dozen students. Some events initially scheduled for the 26th were moved to the afternoon of the 27th, due to industrial action at the University. 

The workshop has yielded a series of articles co-published on the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute website and openDemocracy.net, an open access digital media website with 9 million readers (launched 4 July, 2016 - to be completed 15 August 2016). A proposal for a special issue in an academic journal is under development.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>577d350d33d559.13516822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2016/05/31/speri-woerrc-workshop-real-recovery-will-require-decent-work/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Financing the Future - Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51601CD8-922B-4A93-B7CA-3C913B9CD518</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Information shared and discussion among participants from the British credit union trade associations expressed an intention is to use some of the project funding to bring visitors from other countries where credit unions have achieved a much larger scale of operations, so that it will be possible to learn from their successes.

The aim is to provide a series of collaborative workshops that support capacity building amongst and between academic and non-academic researchers, activists and actors working within the political economy. The starting point was contested notion of 'recovery' and efforts to discovery new policy solutions. Over the course of different style meetings these seminars are developing an interdisciplinary program of research that moves this debate from a 'recovery' from financialisation to a 'discovery' of potential futures for the UK economy. By framing our uncertain future in terms of &amp;quot;discovery&amp;quot; we are exploring the wider social crisis of growing inequality and falling standards of living as well as new ways out of long-term predicaments like the ecological limits to growth without returning or falling-back on economic fundamentals. We are committed to developing forms of knowledge that allow multiple types of expertise to be mobilized to address the very real economic threats the UK faces.

The events seek to provide reciprocal learning experiences and facilitate ongoing conversations and debates that encourage new terms of debate when thinking about UK economic 'recovery'. The ongoing activities encourage academic participants to explore non-traditional forms of research, explore innovative methods and co-production of outputs and dissemination of new information, and to build networks among a diverse group of leading thinkers in order to start crafting alternative strategies to tackling the current economic malaise. At the same time the events encourage non-academic participants to engage with scholarly debates and learn from and contribute to the re-shaping of our understanding of recovery.

A digital hub 'Recovery to Discovery' area of www.perc.org.uk was established in June 2015 to promote events, disseminate outputs, host content and embed Twitter streams. This is a dynamic web space that pushes the boundaries of conversations about the economy and acts as a repository for information stemming from PERC's various research streams, including Recovery to Discovery. It also gives research users ample opportunity to access, engage and contribute to the discussions and research questions explored throughout the seminar series. Currently the website is averaging 570 unique visitors monthly.

We are in the concluding phase of this award and PI, Johnna Montgomerie, is regularly invited to give keynote addresses at academic as well as civil society conferences based on the innovative events this seminar series hosted. Importantly, the open access publication 'Forging Economic Discovery' engaged a range of expert networks across the third sector and policy makers seeking to shape and articulate the wider significance of changing the direction of economic policy in contemporary Britain; because the topic is timely and important which provides the right context to increased the uptake of ideas to find alternatives to financialised growth. We can trace key impact generating activities back to this collaborate publications: specifically, the Labour Party invitation to contribute to the Shadow Chancellors New Economics Lecture Series, the Green Party taking up the proposal for National Debt Audits, the PSA Commission on 'Crisis of Care in Britain'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A808A780-F6D4-40F6-8AD7-8AC374F67ED9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d95e77df7ce4.22017374</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Conference: 'What are the Alternatives to Financialisation?'

A two-day conference entitled 'What are the Alternatives to Financialisation' was held in London at Goldsmiths (March 19-20, 2015). Over the two days, there were over 70 people present, representing academics from diverse disciplines in various UK universities (undergraduate, postgraduate, post-doc, professional), civil society actors and activists, media, think tanks, authors and independent economic analysts. This was a challenging and dynamic event that helped to build networks and to create a platform for engagement among like-minded people seeking new ways of thinking about the economy. Speakers included: Ann Pettifor (Director of Policy Research in Macroeconomics), Andrew Gamble (Author of Crisis Without End?), Steve Keen (Kingston University), Mat Lawrence (Institute for Public Policy Research), James Meadway (New Economics Foundation), Ruth Pearson (Gender Budget Group), Andrew McGettigan (Author, The Great University Gamble), Brett Scott (Author, Heretics Guide to Global Finance), Engelbert Stockhammer (Kingston), Mick Moran (Manchester). Each day included plenary sessions by a combination of key academic and civil society actors working in diverse fields relating to the political economy. Each session was followed by an 'Open Space' break-out session offering opportunities for collaborative discussion and issue/solution identification drawing on the diverse expertise held by participants.

Workshop: Discovering and Discussing the Hidden Costs of Recovery: Challenges faced by UK households

A two-day seminar was held in Sheffield in collaboration with the Sheffield Political Economy Institute (SPERI) entitled 'Discovering and Discussing the Hidden Costs of Recovery: Challenges Faced by UK Households.' (April 16-17, 2015). The event brought together academics and practitioners from UK charities and advocacy organisations. The workshop analysed the gendered costs of recovery and the expanding crisis of social reproduction. Through discussion and debate led by early career scholars and practitioners, this workshop endeavored to rethink recovery in a radical way, taking gender and social reproduction fully into account. Over the 1.5 days 30 people attended the workshop, including 15 academics, 5 PhD students and 10 practicioneers. 

Rather than using a linear and hierarchical model of knowledge transfer, these events utilized an 'Open Space Technology' group dynamic to encourage inclusive conversations amongst participants and research partners. Typically a workshop agenda is set out before invited guests and participants arrive on the day, which facilitates participant-led collaborative agenda setting. While having a basic structure to the event, we were open to shaping the agenda 'along the way'. This method offered the non-academic partners an opportunity to shape a future research agenda stemming from their relevant experience, encouraging them to explore both the opportunities and barriers to developing much-needed collaboration among like-minded actors.

Seminar: Learning and Playing Political Economy
A one-day seminar entitled 'Learning and Playing Political Economy' was held in Warwick, October 9th, 2015. This one-day seminar was an opportunity for scholars of political economy to discuss and debate how they teach the many facets of this interdisciplinary field of study. A teaching focus workshop seeks to bring the same peer-led engagement of research focused workshops &amp;amp; conferences to the teaching element of academic work. All participants were encouraged to share their teaching methods by bringing along course outlines, teaching resources (newspaper articles, films, blogs etc.), assignments, social media tools, games and simulations to share with the group - with a particular focus on the seminar theme, i.e. our understanding of recovery. The morning session focused on 'Decolonising Political Economy', which took seriously calls to no longer simply reproduce dominant orthodoxies by reflecting on the European Enlightenment bias in the political economy cannon. The afternoon session focused on 'Learning Political Economy through Games and Simulations', which seeked to foster collaborative engagement on how games can transform how political economy is taught and learned. The Innovations in Teaching Political Economy workshop build on from a successful series of events the University of Warwick and Goldsmiths over the past five years. We seek to bring teachers of political economy together to debate and discuss the pedagogy of political economy. We are not seeking to devise a definitive way of teaching political economy but to promote innovative practices through peer-based learning. We are currently working on developing the digital outputs from this one-day workshop.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Forging Economic Discovery in 21st Century Britain is an Ebook publication that emerged from Alternatives to Financialisation conference. It comprises a series of 12 essays written by a wide-range of academic and non-academic experts, each engaging with the conference theme their own area of specialism. The aim of the book is to bring key thinkers into dialogue about what needs to change in our understanding and analysis of the state of the UK economy, speaking to the groundswell of interest in wrestling 'the economy' away from the orthodox economics expertise that dominates elite policy circles. The book was published for free by Smashwords and distributed in .mobi, .epub and .pdf formats to major book retailers internationally.
