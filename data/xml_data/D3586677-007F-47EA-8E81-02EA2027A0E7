Both for deriving the model and for its analysis it is crucial to understand the dynamical properties of an ODE. Nonautonomous ODEs are equations where the right-hand side explicitly depends on the time t, e.g. through a time-dependent force. They include asymptotically autonomous systems, where the right-hand side tends to an autonomous, i.e. time-independent, function as time tends to infinity.

Although the equation converges to an autonomous one as time tends to infinity, not all properties of the limiting autonomous equation carry over to the nonautonomous one. In particular, the basin of attraction of a solution consisting of all points approaching this solution, is a nonautonomous object and can only be determined by considering the nonautonomous equation.However, not only the analytical, but also the numerical analysis of nonautonomous ODEs faces the difficulty that any interesting set is unbounded in the time direction.

The main purpose of this project is to develop new tools, both in dynamical systems and in numerical analysis, to overcome this problem and to derive numerical methods for the analysis of nonautonomous systems. Within dynamical systems, the infinite time interval of the nonautonomous system will be transformed into a finite one; in numerical analysis a method will be developed to distinguish between the different dependencies with respect to the time and the space variables.

This includes not only meshless collocation, but any numerical method. Although the project is mainly concerned with asymptotically autonomous dynamical systems, it might lead to the development of similar methods for the treatment of general nonautonomous systems. A method in meshless collocation which distinguishes between different variables will have an impact on general interpolation and collocation. Applications to dynamical systems are not only restricted to the calculation of basins of attraction in asymptotically autonomous systems, but will have an influence on periodic ODEs and nonsmooth systems. The method to calculate basins of attraction in asymptotically autonomous dynamical systems will be transformed into a computer program and will directly benefit all researchers in applied disciplines such as physics, biology, medicine, chemistry and many more who study dynamical systems. This impact will be on a medium timescale. Through these applications, the method will - on a larger timescale - indirectly benefit the people in the UK and abroad. For example, through the collaboration of the PI with Prof. Wagner (Sport Sciences, University of Muenster, Germany), the method will be used for the analysis of time-dependent human movements. This will enable us to make predictions about optimal muscle activation for stable and energy efficient movements in order to achieve a certain goal in sport or, for patients with missing limbs, to develop prostheses and to fit them individually. The immediate impact on researchers in Dynamical Systems and Numerical Analysis will be achieved by publications and presentations at conferences. The researchers involved in this project as well as the students in their groups will benefit from learning new skills through the frequent meetings of the groups which are facilitated by this project. At the end of the project, a computer program will be a visible and applicable product that summarises the methods and will be of interest for applications. Further development of this computer program could lead to an economic product to increase the competitiveness of the UK. The close collaboration of the PI and the CI with researchers in Sports Sciences and industry, e.g. Airbus, are an excellent route of publication of the results to the non-mathematical community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6568</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wendland</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E504C40-8515-498C-8BD0-C28FB39621C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Giesl &amp;amp; Wendland.

The first main result deals with exponentially asymptotically autonomous system, where the right-hand side converges exponentially fast to the limiting autonomous system. The second main result develops a similar method for general asymptotically autonomous systems. In both cases, the infinite time interval of the nonautonomous system was transformed into a finite one. This transformation reflects the speed of convergence of the asymptotically autonomous system to the autonomous one as time tends to infinity. These new methods have been studied theoretically, including error estimates, and, moreover, they have been implemented into a computer program, available at the website http://www.maths.sussex.ac.uk/~giesl/asymptaut.html together with a summary of the results.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Asymptotically autonomous systems arise through time-dependent mechanisms or forces in a variety of applications ranging from physics, biology, medicine, chemistry to economics and climate studies. Methods for the analysis are vital both for deriving appropriate models, to study their properties and to make predictions. The computer program which was developed in this project, will be beneficial to the industrial applications community. The computer tool could possibly, for example, be further developed for use by a climate institute to make weather and climate forecasts, by the public sector to make predictions on the development of the population or the economy, and by the private commercial sector to build machines governed by external time-dependent forces. The transformation of nonautonomous ODEs to a finite time-interval will help to make nonautonomous ODEs treatable numerically since any numerical method can only use a finite number of points. Thus, the theory developed in this project will benefit researchers working in the numerical treatment of nonautonomous ODEs - here numerics is not limited to meshless collocation, but includes all different numerical methods. This new technique will also be of interest for people working in the theory of nonautonomous dynamical systems. The computer program will directly benefit all researchers in applied disciplines such as physics, biology, medicine, chemistry and many more who study dynamical systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>077DC129-7FCA-4EDE-A459-BEC1B68E0883</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-767683499.27634337796f796</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.maths.sussex.ac.uk/~giesl/asymptaut.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Matlab code to compute basins of attraction in asymptotically autonomous Dynamical Systems.</gtr:description><gtr:id>81719BA9-0BAB-446E-9E1E-FB5B9C71A232</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The program is available from the website of the author.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cecadc2e546.35452974</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Software Matlab</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.maths.sussex.ac.uk/~giesl/asymptaut.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>86343815-DC92-4AC2-A6B6-8EA4B836816B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Numerical determination of the basin of attraction for asymptotically autonomous dynamical systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nonlinear Analysis: Theory, Methods &amp;
