This project set out to test these claims through a review of the evidence base relating to local experiences of new migration. An extensive literature details the situations and experiences of migrants in the UK. Glimpses are provided into ways in which migration is being experienced in different ways in different places. Little effort has been put into describing and explaining this variable geography. A small number of studies provide useful insights into different dimensions of place important in shaping experiences of migration but say little about their relative importance or interconnectivity. Little evidence also exists about what works, where and why in terms of promoting trust and understanding and nurturing positive relations between new and long-standing residents. Two key priorities for future research emerge from this review. First, the development of conceptual models of causation relating to the pathways through which place informs and is impacted on by migration. Second, greater understanding of how to actively promote cosmopolitan practices in the context of new migration and analysis of good practice in bridge building between new and long-standing residents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26294</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Public opinion has coalesced around the view that new migration is having a major impact on settled residents in effected locations.

It is difficult to glean any significant insights from available evidence base about what works in terms of promoting positive community relations. Interventions have rarely been subject to any form of evaluation. Information about local initiatives typically takes the form of short vignettes, which describe but make no effort to evaluate the effectiveness or efficiency of interventions. There is little or no evidence of attempts to examine the context, inputs, strategies or methodologies of initiatives. Nor has much effort been put into assessing the outputs and associated costs and benefits of the numerous activities targeted at meeting the challenges raised by new migration. Specific initiatives are referred to as examples of good practice, but no evidence is presented to substantiate these claims.



There is therefore an urgent need for more rigorous evaluation of local initiatives aimed at building bridges between new and long-standing residents. Consideration needs to focus on 'what works for whom in what circumstances?'. This emphasis reflects the fact that the effectiveness of different interventions will vary depending upon the circumstances and situation in which they are introduced, an important consideration given evidence of the very different experiences, outcomes and challenges associated with new migration in different places. Armed with a greater understanding of what works under what circumstances policy makers and practitioners will be better able to decide which approach to implement in what conditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E4CFFA96-1A49-45EE-B1DD-01CD43E7C62A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8796407476.809256775ed582</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/Funding-Opportunities/Research-funding/Connected-Communities/Scoping-studies-and-reviews/Documents/New%20Migration%20Neighbourhood%20Effects%20and%20Community%20Change.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J500573/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
