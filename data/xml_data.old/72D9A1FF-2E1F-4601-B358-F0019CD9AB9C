&lt;p>The aim of this study is to help to understand why private sector malaria patients are less likely to receive ACTs, and what factors act as facilitators and barriers to receiving them. There will be a particular focus on the responsiveness of demand for ACTs to price, and the potential effects of interventions to reduce the price of antimalarial medicines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data collected from households and sources of malaria treatment in Benin, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia will be used to describe whether treatment was sought, from where, what antimalarial was received, the price paid for the medicines, and total costs of treatment. Statistical modelling will be used to ascertain which factors are important facilitators and barriers to receiving an ACT. These models will then be used to predict how changes in ACT price, household income, distance to outlets, etc., might affect the number of patients treated with ACTs.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The treatment of malaria in developing countries takes place in a complex and pluralistic environment, we believe that a better understanding of treatment seeking behaviour and demand for antimalarials will benefit a wide range of stakeholders, from people in communities where malaria poses a substantial risk to well-being to the many national and international agencies working to improve access to treatment in endemic countries.

The research findings have the potential to benefit people suffering from malaria (~250 million cases per year worldwide, of which 86% occur in Africa) by strengthening policies to improve access to antimalarials. Better information about the factors influencing demand will help to identify key barriers to access in different settings and to adapt policies to maximise their impact.

In the study countries, government bodies active in setting malaria case management policies and in regulating the pharmaceutical sector will benefit from having access to high quality data on the health seeking behaviour of their constituent populations. This will assist the identification of targets for action, and the design of evidence-based interventions to increase access to treatment. For example, better information on the elasticity of demand for ACTs, could lead to better predictions of demand response to subsidy programmes, thereby improving demand forecasting and reducing risks of under- and over-supply by national procurement agencies. This, in turn, will lead to fewer treatment stock-outs at health facilities and more efficient use of scarce government resources for health.

This research should also improve understanding of the role of the private commercial sector in supplying antimalarials in endemic settings and, where this is found to have potential for public health impact, lead to greater involvement of this sector in medicines distribution.

The UK Department for International Development has identified malaria as a key priority, and developed a business case for investing in malaria control based on the high burden of the disease in terms of mortality, health care cost and impact on economic growth and development. DFID is an important funder of the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria, a global initiative to subsidise ACTs. Improved evidence about the characteristics of demand for antimalarial medicines will be used by DFID and other agencies to shape malarial control interventions.

Other bilateral and multilateral agencies (eg. the Global Fund, UNITAID and the WHO) and civil society organisations (eg. Malaria Consortium and Population Services International) engaged in the procurement and distribution of antimalarials may similarly benefit from the output of this research. As these organisations commonly provide funding to improve access to antimalarials, project outputs may also contribute to the better targeting of funding, the design of more effective interventions and also of more informed evaluations (eg. setting benchmarks for success).
 
Our work on ACTwatch has also put us in close contact with organisations involved in antimalarial market shaping and demand management activities, such as the Clinton Health Access Initiative (conducting global ACT demand forecasts and research on maximising the impact of subsidies for ACTs) and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (a public-private partnership developing new antimalarials also engaged in action research to improve ACT access). While the project outputs will directly benefit these organisations by providing them with crucial market intelligence, they may also lead to the development of better tools to predict market behaviour. Similarly, ACT manufacturers will benefit from stronger evidence on which to forecast demand, allowing them to better plan to meet demand when there are important market changes, such as subsidy programmes or large increases in donor funding to purchase ACTs, leading to a more reliable supply of medicines.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>144031</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presentation at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38740824-1CD2-425D-9C80-E230BABD777B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interacted with conference participants during the poster presentation.

To adequately capture and analyse this diversity of healthcare markets, we developed a novel method of combining household and treatment source data to better characterise household access to malaria treatment. This method also allows for demand functions to be estimated using exogenous measures of supply-side characteristics, overcoming a limitation of conventional healthcare demand studies, which typically rely on self-reported data from patients and caregivers. 
We found large differences in household access to malaria treatment across urban and rural locations, and across countries. While nearly all urban households had reasonable access to at least one treatment source stocking the recommended medication, artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), household access was lower in rural areas. The gap between urban and rural access was smallest in Uganda, moderate in Benin and Nigeria, and largest in Zambia. Rural access to providers stocking ACTs improved between survey rounds in Benin, Nigeria and Uganda; however, no change was observed in Zambia. Several personal and household characteristics were found to influence the decision to seek care for malaria from a source outside the home and the choice of treatment source. The strongest predictors of these choices varied by country. For example, in Uganda treatment outside the home was more likely to be sought for boys than girls; while in Zambia it was more common for younger children to receive external treatment than older children. Regarding choice of treatment source, a caregiver's positive attitude toward the efficacy of ACT increased the likelihood of choosing a public/non-profit health facility over private sources in Uganda and Nigeria, while better caregiver knowledge of the main malaria symptom had a similar effect in Benin. Wealthier households in Uganda, Nigeria and Benin were also more likely to seek care from more expensive treatment sources, such as from retail pharmacies rather than public health facilities.
Among the supply-side factors influencing demand, treatment sources farther from home were less likely to be chosen, and this effect was consistent across the study countries. In contrast, the price of malaria treatment appeared to have a smaller effect on the choice of treatment source and on the choice of antimalarial. When interpreting these results in light of the large shifts in aggregate ACT demand observed in countries with an ACT subsidy programme, three explanations are possible. First, these changes may have been driven by improvements in access. Second, aggregate demand shifts may have been due to adult demand, which could be more price sensitive than paediatric demand as captured in our household data. Third, our price elasticity estimates could suffer from endogeneity bias. The latter two hypotheses cannot be tested, as data on adult demand for antimalarials were not collected and IV methods to correct for endogeneity cannot be applied for multinomial discrete outcomes using standard econometrics packages.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are relevant to many actors across public, private and third sectors who work to improve access to malaria treatment and healthcare more broadly in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. These actors operate at international- and national-levels, and include multilateral and bilateral agencies, governments, civil society organisations, researchers and the private commercial sector. 
The methodological innovations developed have the potential to influence how access to health care is measured in LMICs, particularly where private providers are an important treatment source and for conditions that may be treated by informal types of providers. By incorporating this approach into evaluations of interventions that aim to improve healthcare access, our research could also lead to better explanations of why such complex interventions either succeed or fail.
Our findings have also led to improved understanding of the key demand drivers for malaria treatment. In particular, our finding of the high level of sensitivity of demand to travel distance to providers could be used to optimise the design of interventions to improve access to antimalarials, including the setting of optimal ACT pricing and subsidy levels, decisions on the issuing of new provider licenses by regulators, and investment planning for new health infrastructure.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E0551023-BDD0-43EE-9173-C2B35846E46B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>551937f08c4ee2.76809527</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Project case study highlighted in the SDAI Phase 1 Research Impact publication</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF954042-2BD6-44E3-ABDD-3B139A519A23</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6e454e37243.09881006</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/themed-publications/sdai-phase-1-research-impacts/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Guided by recent conceptual developments in the definition of access to health care, we have developed as part of this project a novel approach to that integrates data on treatment seeking behaviour from individuals and households with realistic appraisals of the community-level health care system to produce people-centred measures of health care access. Using access to malaria treatment in four endemic countries as a case study, we have also illustrated how this novel approach can be used to provide a more complete and integrated understanding of access to health care from the perspective of households in complex and dynamic contexts through the production of objective and meaningful indicators that can be compared across contexts and over time. The approach could be readily adapted to examine access issues for other health conditions, informing policies to improve access and providing richer explanations of why such complex interventions either succeed or fail.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0FF57D92-7FAA-4FCF-A4A7-76E8229F0B59</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have also extended this novel people-centred approach to measuring household access to health care to develop choice set datasets that we have used to assess the determinants of treatment seeking behaviour.
