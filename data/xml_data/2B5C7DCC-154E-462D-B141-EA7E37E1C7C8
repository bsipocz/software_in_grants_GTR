In addition dolomitic limes, containing magnesium, exhibit enhanced properties when compared to their pure lime counterparts, however there is limited knowledge of the underlying reasons.

Lime based mortars are ideal candidates to replace cement mortars in many applications where lower strength is an advantage such as new build housing, forms of construction utilising organic fillers such as lime-hemp, and conservation and restoration applications. Indeed lime mortars offer many advantages over cement in terms of moisture permittivity, ability to accommodate movement, self-healing properties and ability to sequester carbon dioxide. Cementious binders are produced at much higher temperatures compared to lime and have large carbon dioxide emissions associated with their manufacture.

Atomistic modelling provides a unique opportunity to probe these mechanisms at a fundamental level thereby elucidating the processes responsible for developing the properties of industrial importance. Many existing and past studies of building lime binders have focused on bulk properties for instance through large scale bulk property testing, whilst not taking into account atom level processes. In recent years the cement industry has employed atomistic modelling of hydrated silicates as a means of understanding material behaviour. 

Recent studies have demonstrated that the morphology and composition of a lime crystal can influence the carbonation process, and by association mechanical behaviour. In addition magnesium containing dolomitic limes show improved performance in many respects including strength development. Rate of carbonation is an extremely important issue as this can dictate the speed at which a building can be erected and therefore the associated costs. The ability to improve the carbonation rate and therefore hardening rate through control of composition and morphology will lead to enhanced products with better environmental credentials. 

In the first instance this proposal seeks to develop atomistic models to describe the important aspects of lime binder behaviour and validate these against laboratory samples. Atomistic models will generate Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns for direct comparison with experimental measurements. These initial models will then be developed further to investigate firstly carbonation and then time dependent and plastic mechanical properties. 

Additionally the research will investigate the underlying reasons for the improved performance observed in magnesium containing dolomitic limes. The project is expected to bring long term benefits to the construction industry over the coming decades. In the shorter term industry will benefit through planned workshops and site visits which will showcase the application of atomistic modelling to lime manufacturers. The project will support the development of enhanced projects through the new knowledge gained.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main thrust of this project is to use a combination of experiment and atomistic simulation to give an improved understanding of lime at a fundamental level and to link that understanding to the properties that make limes attractive to the construction industry. Academia, industry and society will benefit from this project primarily through a greater understanding of the way lime behaves in construction materials. In particular the knowledge gained will be essential for the greater exploitation of lime in the future through engineering the crystalline morphology and composition. Understanding of the important processes responsible for movement (creep and shrinkage) and hardening (carbonation) will impact the construction industry through better and more efficient use of lime.

Data from the project will impact the policy makers responsible for building regulations by allowing standards to be based on our scientific results for lime mortars. A greater understanding of the hardening and movement characteristic will impact thin wall construction by providing quantitative information to architects and engineers relevant to the prediction of long term behaviour from fundamental materials properties. The proposal will impact the conservation and restoration industries who exploit lime for its vapour permeable properties. 

A significant impact of the project will be guidance for material specifications issued by the manufacturers. The greater depth of knowledge of lime carbonation behaviour will impact long term durability by promoting the optimisation of these materials. This will thereby support government targets to reduce the use of materials with high embodied energy such as Portland cement. The atomistic models developed during the project will provide a foundation upon which more complex models to address important issues such as the influence of ions leached from low embodied energy and waste materials can be based. Such materials include pulverised fuel ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, silica fume and organic fillers such as hemp. Lime displays a propensity to react with airborne pollutants such as sulphur dioxide. The atomistic models developed will provide the foundation needed not only to model such interactions on the surface of buildings, for instance in a lime render, but also to inform upon surface reactions of industrial flue cleaning materials. Under polluted conditions dolomitic lime can display increased reactivity and this project will contribute towards elucidating the role of magnesium. 

The post-doctoral researchers working on the project will gain valuable experience of the experimental and modelling techniques in addition to experience attending and presenting at conferences. The large amount of publishable data expected to be generated from the project will provide opportunity for the post-doctoral researchers to gain experience in writing technical reports and for journal publication. The project investigators who, between them, are professional members of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) will provide relevant training and support on continuing professional development (CPD). Such activities will be appropriate for progression through these institutions, or similar. Provision to allow each PDRA, to attend post-doctoral training courses (as appropriate), will provide an enhanced research and development environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>646152</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Workshop on the Application of Nano-lime for Consolidation of Weathered Stones</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4062252-8BD5-4D71-9BFD-1AF95BCBE690</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many of the heritage buildings in the UK and around the world are built from natural limestone. These stones are susceptible to a range of mechanisms which result in damage and deterioration of the surface. Both weathering and environmental factors, including atmospheric pollutants, can lead to significant increases in porosity and mechanical weakening. Application of a treatment designed to consolidate and strengthen the surface is a common remedy, however there are numerous examples of inappropriate use of incompatible treatments leading to greater damage. Material compatibility is of key importance, and in the case of limestone, nanolime is of great interest to the conservation sector. However a lack of knowledge into its long term performance means there is no reliable guidance for its appropriate use. 
The workshop was attended by over 70 representatives from organisations working in conservation in the UK. This was an effective opportunity to disseminate the research directly to practitioners and ensure immediate impact of the most important findings. The direct impact is a reduced risk of buildings being subjected to harmful practices leading to subsequent damage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cdef20156c37.17026078</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Innovation in Low Carbon Cement and Concrete</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>462BD4B7-E830-4CF3-96E7-1BC29DE58D10</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sponsored under the Newton Fund Researcher Links scheme, University College London (UCL) and China
Building Materials Academy (CBMA) are jointly hosting this workshop on the theme related to low-carbon
cement and concrete in University College London between 21st - 24th September, 2016. This workshop is
aimed to create a platform where the early career researchers can be mentored by established researchers
to speed up their career development and also to bring together the communities from cement chemist,
concrete technologist, engineers and physicists from both academic and industrial background from the UK
and China to share their latest research outcome and innovations in order to promote industrial application
of low-carbon cement and concrete in real world.

In the next three days, 40 oral presentations and 14 posters will be presented by senior researchers and,
mostly, early career researchers from both the UK and China. Two additional sessions have been purposely
designed to facilitate the career development of our young researchers.
