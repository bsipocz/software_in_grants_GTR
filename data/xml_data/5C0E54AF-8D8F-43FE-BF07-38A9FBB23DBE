It is a common disease that affects approximately 1:100 people worldwide. Cells from the blood move into the joints where they trigger inflammation causing stiffness and swelling, which eventually leads to irreversible joint damage and disability. Estimates suggest that 40% of patients are unable to work within 5 years of diagnosis. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis and current therapies are often toxic or their use by the NHS is limited by the cost. One of the leading therapies is only given to 10% of patients in the UK due to the high cost of manufacture. In addition, these therapies have many side effects and not all patients respond to treatment. Thus, there is an important medical need for the development of new more affordable therapies with fewer side effects.

We have recently identified a possible link between toll-like receptors (proteins on cells that are normally used by the body to sense infections and tissue damage) and the inflammation found in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients. During this work we discovered chemicals that could control these receptors. When tested in joint tissue removed from rheumatoid patients having joint replacement surgery, we noticed that these chemicals could also reduce the inflammation in this tissue that is associated with the disease. To develop these chemicals into a drug that can be used in the clinic we first need to understand exactly how they work. To do this we will perform experiments that are comparable to going fishing. The chemicals will be used as bait to pull out the targets that they interact with in human cells. These targets will then be studied in detail to help us understand how they control toll-like receptors and inflammation. This will provide important information that is needed for the development of new therapies for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease effecting 1% of the worldwide population. It is characterised by a progressive joint destruction leading to increased disability and mortality with no known cure. Current therapies include disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs which are often toxic and biological therapies (antibodies and soluble receptors) specifically targeting immune mediators. Not all patients respond to these therapies, with some becoming refractory to treatment over time. In addition, the use of biological therapies is often limited by cost, particularly within the UK. In recent studies we have identified a potential role for a subset of the toll-like receptor family (TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9) in the production of cytokines from human RA joint tissue. As part of that work, it was discovered that mianserin a low molecular weight 5- hydroxytriptamine (5-HT) receptor antagonist was able to inhibit TLR function at higher concentrations as an off target effect. The same concentration was able to inhibit the spontaneous production of cytokines from human RA synovial tissue cells. Further investigation revealed that mianserin could therapeutically halt disease progression in vivo, in a murine model of RA. Mianserin itself does not represent a therapy as the off target effect requires doses higher than could be used safely in the clinic and in addition is associated with undesirable antidepressant effects. However, this early work suggests that it may be possible to develop a low molecular weight therapy for RA that would function by inhibiting a subset of TLRs. To make this possible novel structures will need to be designed to remove the 5-HT receptor antagonism activity whilst increasing the affinity for TLR inhibition. To make this an achievable goal it will be essential to identify and validate the mechanism which leads to these beneficial off target effects. This study aims to identify the molecular target responsible for the inhibition of TLRs and to investigate the downstream signalling pathways that are inhibited so that we can further our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie RA pathogenesis and initiate a programme of drug development for the future treatment of RA.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252621</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Chemistry Imperial</gtr:description><gtr:id>88C17552-365A-41D7-82FE-3B68A6254CE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of data for a successful MRC grant application</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>Er1k6LxExr2-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Conjugation of small molecules with reactive groups to allow for them to be used in affinity purification to determine the molecular target of these molecules.
