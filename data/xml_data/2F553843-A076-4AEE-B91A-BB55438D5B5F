Nationally there are a number of governmental bodies interested in research on 'threats to national infrastructure' including the Cabinet Office, the Home Office, Civil Contingencies Secretariat and CPNI (Centre for Protection of the National Infrastructure). There are also regional authorities which might be interested and I have previously worked with the Emergency Planning Department of Essex County Council, Essex Fire and Rescue, London Resilience and Birmingham Resilience. Internationally, groups such as the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) will be beneficiaries as will third sector organisations such as the Institute of Race Relations (who have taken an interest in my work on security and equality).
Within the wider public the leadership activities which I have considered are beneficial in terms of increasing public awareness of this issue as they are engaging and show how inter-disciplinary working is necessary to meet future threats to the national infrastructure. 
There are three particular benefits arising from this research.
Firstly, in terms of improving national security the research identifies those factors which are most relevant to dealing with threats to national infrastructures in context. For example, the research considers how protection of the national infrastructure is influenced by welfare systems, economic factors and equalities. This is important in terms of identifying factors that are significant in infrastructure protection particularly in times of economic recession and social change. Through the use of case studies and policy interviews this research will be important in considering how threats to the national infrastructure can be considered with reference to the national, social and economic context. These factors will be disseminated not only through academic publications but also through reports and the project website. The impact of this is likely to be significantly enhanced through the integrated leadership activities which have been planned.
Secondly, in terms of shaping and enhancing the effectiveness of the public sector the research considers the extent to which policy borrowing and international sharing of practice may be of benefit in protecting the national infrastructure. Those working in the public sector in this area will be the subjects of this research as well as generating new knowledge.
Thirdly, this research will develop important skills for the researchers involved in terms of inter-disciplinary and cross-sectoral working which are vital for the future of research in this area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>457531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk on response to infrastructure failure</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C1CF037D-BD12-4E7F-89F9-E4E446EE0760</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor John Preston gave a talk to a consortium of pupils from Surrey schools on response to infrastructure failure (11th October, 2013).

In the event of a failure of the electricity supply, a water failure or a telecommunications outage we need to know how people will respond and how to manage that response. This project considered the different ways in which threats to infrastructure are managed in five countries (UK, US, Japan, Germany and New Zealand), how populations respond to those threats and how this knowledge can be used to aid response in the event of a major infrastructure failure in the UK. This report considers the findings and impacts of this project

FINDINGS

A. Managing infrastructure threats: a globalised picture?

Through analysis of national policy documents, archival research and expert interviews it became clear that there was no 'global consensus' on how to manage infrastructure failure. Countries had very different polices in terms of how they would manage a national emergency of this kind and this had implications for the ways in which different sections of the population were treated (Preston, Chadderton and Kitagawa, 2014). In each country it was found that path dependence was key to understanding how different national governments developed their own ways of dealing with infrastructure failure and population response. Once countries had adopted a policy trajectory it becomes difficult to change.

In the United Kingdom, an analysis of the history of major catastrophic infrastructure failures showed that few lessons were learnt over time and that institutional inertia means that it is difficult for industry and government to change practices (Preston, 2014a). This also applies to population response. Even where the government considers that public information needs to be changed the resistance of other government departments, the scale of the issue and public apathy means that this is difficult to achieve (Preston, 2014b). Wider military objectives in the UK have sometimes influenced plans for dissemination of public information material in times of crisis (Preston, 2014b) and have even influenced wider public policy (Chadderton, 2014). In the United States, the use of Executive Orders and super-ordinate agencies (such as the Department of Homeland Security) to construct plans for infrastructure failure was commonplace from the early cold war. This was a different approach to the United Kingdom but it was not immune from inertia. We consider that there was no 'Golden Age' in the United States of preparing populations for catastrophe (Preston, 2015a) and that inequalities of race and class persisted in governmental plans to change school infrastructure for resilience (Preston, 2015b). In Germany infrastructure protection and education of the population for disasters has been centrally led by the German Federal Office for Civil Defence and Disaster Assistance, which was set up in response to the 9/11 attacks on the US, and extensive flooding of the River Elbe in 2002. However the federal political system meant that civil defence and infrastructure protection laws vary in each German state and change was hard to implement. Germany has a state-funded civil defence volunteer force, the Federal Agency for Technical Relief, which has existed in this form since shortly after the Second World War. The force is highly trained and has an excellent reputation, but, inequalities of gender and race persist. Germany traditionally tends to avoid high-profile campaigns about disaster preparedness due to narratives of the German democratic nation as secure and peaceful, which originated at the founding of West Germany in 1949, and continue to shape contemporary political narratives (Chadderton, 2015). We therefore found that even when countries shared a common language and policy networks (US and UK) or were on the same continent with economic and political union through the EU (UK and Germany) there were significant differences in policy.

In countries which face major natural disasters that impact on infrastructure - Japan and New Zealand - there is no commonality in approach. For Japan, preparing for forthcoming disasters, including mega earthquakes and volcano eruptions, has been an urgent and necessary national agenda, particularly since the Japan Great East Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011 (Kitagawa 2015b). Developing ways to 'live with' natural disasters has been promoted by policy-makers, experts and communities (Kitagawa 2015a). Under the Basic Act for National Resilience passed in 2014, cross-sectoral policies have been implemented in preventing and mitigating disasters and in developing resilience in the population. Like Japan, New Zealand faces very serious natural disasters and protection of the critical infrastructure and preparedness of the population are high on the political agenda but New Zealand adopts a very different approach. The Ministry for Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM) leads on this, with their vision of 'Resilient New Zealand' and focus on the 4 'R's': Reduction, Readiness, Response, Recovery. There are CDEM organisations at three levels: local, regional and national. Very innovatively, the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act (2002) states communities should manage their own risks. Therefore, although both countries adopt a lifelong learning approach to managing infrastructure failure, Japan's approach is 'top-down' compared to New Zealand's 'bottom up' approach.

B. How individuals and communities act in infrastructure failure

Although countries have very different policies and methods of preparing for infrastructure failure, there are striking commonalities in the ways in which people and communities act. We analysed ten major disasters and catastrophes across the five countries to consider the behavioural factors which were of greatest significance (Preston, Chadderton, Kitigawa and Edmonds, 2015). We found that there were striking commonalities in behaviour. Individuals behaved rationally, engaged in mutual aid and would not break with social or societal norms unless it was necessary for immediate survival. At a community level, there was strong evidence of community learning and organisation. Individuals and communities learnt together to solve collective action problems in an infrastructure failure. 

Through an analysis of community learning we have developed a new model for community learning in infrastructure failure (which can be applied to any disaster or emergency). We distinguish between three forms of community learning in an infrastructure failure:-

1, NAVIGATION: Incremental, small loops of learning, experimentation and learning from events as they arise. The current paradigm of community learning for a disaster predominates. Communities deal with events as they occur and find solutions quickly.

2. ORGANISATION: Experimentation leads to new methods of resource allocation and mutuality in an incremental fashion. This leads to new methods of community organisation.
3. REFRAMING: The disaster is reframed, either through drawing parallels with historical events or adopting new paradigms of disaster management, even questioning the ways in which disasters are managed.
We see that there is a move from navigation to organisation and reframing in infrastructure failure. Social media and new social movements mean that in disasters such as Hurricane Sandy (2012) applications such as Twitter and Facebook help with rapid community organisation. In addition, new social movements such as Occupy Sandy, an offshoot of the Occupy movement not only provide support for those who have lost access to infrastructure, but also reframe the way in which resource distribution is considered.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In developing tools for infrastructure and community response to infrastructure
