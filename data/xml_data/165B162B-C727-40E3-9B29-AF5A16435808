Supported by the EPSRC DTP, Warwick will fund a total of 66 3.5 year studentships starting in the academic years 2016-17 and 2017-18, across our Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, the School of Engineering and Warwick Manufacturing Group. The Warwick DTP programme will deliver engineers and scientists with in-depth, advanced research training, as well as a broad understanding of their subject area, to address important 21st Century questions linked to EPSRC research areas and aligned to Warwick strategic priorities.

The Warwick EPSRC DTP offers: 
 An opportunity for the next generation of young researchers to address key strategic priorities in engineering and physical sciences. 
 An exceptional programme of research training with opportunities for interdisciplinary research and industrial collaborations. 
 Access to world leading technologies and state-of-the-art facilities. 
 Excellent standards of supervision, management and mentoring. 
 Ongoing career advice to enable students to explore the impact they can have in a wide range of sectors and so develop and manage their careers. 

Warwick is ever present in the lists of the UK's greatest universities; we ranked 7th in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), and 6th in the 2016 Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide. Research in EPS is one of Warwick's key strengths; four of Warwick's EPS departments were ranked in the top 10 of the 2014 REF rankings (Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics) and seven were ranked in the top 10 of the 2016 Complete University Guide (Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Warwick Manufacturing Group). Our EPS postgraduate researchers work alongside the world's top academics and we provide state-of-art research facilities and infrastructure.
Our PhD students are offered a broad range of training opportunities on topics which aid training and are critical to a life beyond PhD research. All EPS PhD students are enrolled on the accredited PG Certificate in Transferable Skills in Science (www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pioneers), which provides graduates with a skill set appropriate for any future career, develops critical analysis and encourages reflective thinking. 
EPSRC DTP studentships will be available through each of our EPS academic departments. Studentships will be pre-allocated by discipline, the breakdown for which is anticipated to be as follows:

Discipline No of Studentships
Mathematical Sciences 20
Manufacturing and Engineering 24
Physical Sciences 15
In addition to the above, it is anticipated that 7 studentships will be awarded to strategic research programmes, such as the Energy Research Accelerator (http://www.era.ac.uk/) and the Alan Turing Institute (https://turing.ac.uk/).
Subject to confirmation from EPSRC, the above DTP allocations will be approved before Dec 2015 and individual projects agreed with host departments. DTP opportunities will then be widely advertised on web sites such as jobs.ac.uk and findaphd.com, as well as on the web pages of departments and the University.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4824774</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509796/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
