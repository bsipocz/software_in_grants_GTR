&lt;em> proof competencies&lt;/em>, i.e., their abilities to investigate whether and why 'things work' in mathematics by means of the logical structure of the mathematical system rather than based on the teachers' authority.&amp;nbsp; Proficiency in proof can provide students with a basis for deep learning in mathematics and prepare them for advanced mathematical studies.&amp;nbsp; Yet, even high-attaining secondary students face serious difficulties with proof and prior research offered little guidance about how teachers can help students overcome these difficulties.
&lt;br />
&lt;br />The project took a step towards addressing this problem.&amp;nbsp; Organised as a design experiment in two secondary mathematics classes over a period of two years (when the students were in Years 10 and 11), it aimed to generate theoretical and practical knowledge about how secondary teachers can better support students' learning of proof.&amp;nbsp; The project focused on high-attaining students: given the limited prior research knowledge about how to improve students' understanding of proof, it was strategic to focus, as a first step in a long-term research programme, on a student population that offered better chances for success.
&lt;br />
&lt;br />The project showed the feasibility of the goal to develop high-attaining secondary students' proof competencies and identified the generation and resolution of 'cognitive conflicts' as a key contributive factor to that development.&amp;nbsp; There was also evidence that the students who participated in the project achieved better GCSE results and were more likely to pursue advanced mathematical studies than previous student cohorts in the same school.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The 'cognitive conflict' approach to mathematics teaching : the case of proof</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>3536F336-E0FC-4ACF-B419-8DC1591082AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited research presentation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9245398835.5075932aff360a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The 'cognitive conflict' approach to mathematics teaching : the case of proof</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>CAE2C506-1844-4A95-A12B-BBD02E7CC1B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A major idea of the 'cognitive conflict' approach to mathematics teaching is that, by

creating situations where students' current understandings do not hold, students will feel

the need to resolve the emerging contradictions in their understandings. Yet, students

tend to treat contradictions as exceptions and thus do not experience a cognitive conflict.

We will present a theoretical framework that aims to cast light on conditions that

increase the potential of contradictions to generate a cognitive conflict for students.

Also, we will use findings from a four-year design experiment to support the proposed

framework and exemplify its application in the domain of proof.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6362098489.29392052ab6174a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://www.maths-ed.org.uk/colloquia/L2009.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Enhancing students' proof competencies in secondary mathematics classrooms</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>E9AF094D-9884-4AD4-B82A-6DDB4A86FF75</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop to the secondary mathematics mentor teachers who work with secondary mathematics teacher trainees enrolled in the University of Cambridge Secondary Mathematics PGCE Course, University of Cambridge, Cambridge.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-970784855.04797182abe3b28</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Classroom-based design experiments in educational research : a study on the 'cognitive conflict' approach to mathematics teaching</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>5D192C8E-B6E4-45E1-83D5-7345A95F8254</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The design experiment methodology has been created to address issues central to the study of teaching and learning, primarily the need to develop theoretically grounded and empirically tested instructional interventions in actual classroom settings.

? Evidence form the project showed that the participating secondary students not only improved their proof competencies, but also achieved better general mathematics results in national examinations and were more likely to pursue advanced mathematical studies than previous comparable student cohorts in the same school. Thus the project contributed to the current efforts to address pressing societal/economic needs for increased capacity and better future workforce in mathematics-related professions. 

Improving mathematics teachers' professional practice through collaborative research:
? The project was carried out collaboratively with two secondary mathematics teachers and was designed in a way that promoted professional reflection and development. Evidence from the project showed lasting impact on the professional thinking/practice of the participating teachers, and also spread of this thinking/practice to colleagues in their school. Furthermore, the project has contributed already to the career advancement of one of the participating teachers: the teacher's work in the project featured prominently in her successful application for Advanced Skills Teacher status.

Improving mathematics teachers' professional practice through wider dissemination:
? The project has reached professional audiences through a range of dissemination activities in England and abroad, communicating its research findings in forms that are tailored to the needs of teachers, policy makers, and curriculum developers. One project output, a publication in Mathematics Teaching, has been found particularly helpful by groups of mathematics teachers as well as projects and initial teacher education courses that aim to develop highly skilled mathematics teachers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4807371C-42D4-47D0-A6C3-D249A686492F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54483dbca6eb39.66254136</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project was organised as a design experiment in two secondary mathematics classes in an English state school. It involved development, implementation, and analysis of the effectiveness of six lesson sequences in the two classes over a period of two years - when the students were in Years 10 and 11. The lesson sequences aimed to enhance students' proof competencies and mathematical proficiency more broadly, ranged from one to five 50-minute periods each, and were implemented by the teachers of the classes (each teacher worked with the same class in Years 10 and 11). The student participants were all 61 students who, during the first year of the project, belonged to the school's highest and second-highest attaining Year 10 classes - set 1 and set 2, respectively. These students achieved levels 7 or 8 in the end-of-Year 9 SAT exams. 



The project offered new insights into methodological practices for creating a credible picture of students' proof competencies. First, it showed that conclusions about students' proof competencies based only on (even extended) survey data can be seriously misleading, and highlighted the importance of testing such conclusions with follow-up interviews. Similarly, it showed that (even extended) student written arguments during a lesson can support conclusions that consistently understate the quality of students' proof competencies when compared with the quality reflected in students' oral presentations (during the lesson) of the same arguments.



Both participating classes - sets 1 and 2 - achieved better end-of-Year 11 GCSE results when compared to the corresponding sets in the same school the previous two years (the end-of-Year 9 SAT results of corresponding sets were comparable). In addition to the generally-improved GCSE results, the school witnessed an unprecedented increase in the number of students from sets 1 and 2 who opted for A-levels in Mathematics and Further Mathematics: from 33 and 3 students in a 'good' past year to 44 and 8, respectively. So there is evidence that the project not only better prepared students for advanced mathematical studies but also generated more interest among them for such studies.



Three features of the lesson sequences (design and implementation) appeared to have had a major role in the growth in students' proof competencies in both sets: (1) the students' encounter with carefully-engineered 'cognitive conflicts' that challenged students' misconceptions and created in them a need to modify existing inaccurate understandings about proof; (2) the teachers' critical role in helping students resolve emerging conflicts and develop understandings that better approximated conventional knowledge; and (3) the social interactions facilitated by the teachers that enabled students to learn from each other.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) The lesson sequences developed by the project can inform curriculum development and can be used by teachers, textbook authors, and teacher educators.

2) As I explain below, the scientific findings of the project set a foundation for future research that could explore what it might take to scale up effective teaching practice in the domain of proof. 
 The project followed a 4-year design experiment, which I had conducted with Gabriel Stylianides in the United States to address some similar research objectives but with undergraduate students. The current project's findings showed that some suitably modified versions of the lesson sequences that we originally developed and used in the American study played out in remarkably similar ways in England. Also, the lesson sequences produced remarkably similar learning outcomes among secondary students when they were implemented faithfully to their design. These findings are important, for prior research and practice showed that such highly desirable learning outcomes are atypical among secondary and undergraduate students. Their replication in two different cultural settings and with two different student populations opens a window of optimism that it is possible to scale up effective teaching practice in the domain of proof. Yet, some fundamental questions arise. For example: What general principles can be derived from the modification process of the focal lesson sequences from one setting to the other? What kind of support did the secondary teachers receive that enabled them to faithfully implement the lesson sequences in their classrooms? How might that support be systematically documented so that it can be effectively communicated to large numbers of teachers?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E7DBE951-E561-4F3A-8BE7-5E12CFE670ED</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6890180881.032889779b977e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AD5C1D05-DE4F-4B46-9299-65D433280C37</gtr:id><gtr:title>Breaking the equation 'empirical argument = proof'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mathematics teaching</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f481ae5cc02999fda8e8ec90512764fc"><gtr:id>f481ae5cc02999fda8e8ec90512764fc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Andreas J.
