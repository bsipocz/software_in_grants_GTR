One common and important class of glycoprotein is the 'N-linked' variety, and many of these molecules are essential for life playing important roles related to development and good health. The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex is the biological machine that adds N-linked glycans to proteins whilst they are being made inside the cell. Whilst the oligosaccharyltransferase of higher organisms is a large enzyme complex with a number of different components or subunits, bacteria have a much simpler enzyme with only one subunit that appears to perform a similar role. Such comparisons have led us to question the function of the various extra subunits of the human oligosaccharyltransferase machinery, and in particular to ask how one particular additional subunit, called ribophorin I, might act to alter or improve the production of glycoproteins. We recently discovered that ribophorin I acts as a non-catalytic subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase. In practice this means that whilst ribophorin I is essential for the N-glycosylation of some proteins, may others do not need ribophorin I at all. We propose a model where the oligosaccharyltransferase complex has a central machine called the STT3 protein, and suggest that it is this component that does the actual 'work' of N-glycosylation. The role of ribophorin I would then be to assist this central machine by somehow helping unusual or difficult proteins to be delivered to the STT3 protein correctly and in a way that allows them to be efficiently glycosylated. The aim of this project is to investigate exactly what ribophorin I does and to establish how it carries out its role as part of this larger machine. To do this we will answer two fundamental questions: firstly, what are the properties of a protein that mean it needs the help of ribophorin I in order to be properly N-glycosylated; and secondly, how does ribophorin I actually assist the core STT3 subunit so that these proteins can be dealt with efficiently by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Protein N-glycosylation in eukaryotes is typically catalysed by a large multisubunit complex, the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). Whilst the STT3A subunit of the OST complex is essential for function, the ribophorin I subunit is only required for the N-glycosylation of some precursors. Our current working hypothesis is that ribophorin I acts as a chaperone or escort to promote the N-glycosylation of selected substrates by catalytic STT3 subunits. This project will use small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to manipulate the levels of STT3A or ribophorin I expressed in mammalian cells and then exploit these modified cells in various ways. To identify the feature(s) that make a precursor protein ribophorin I dependent, we will screen numerous different substrates to establish the effect of ribophorin I depletion upon their N-glycosylation. To ensure our screen is as wide-ranging and unbiased as possible two distinct approaches will be used. Firstly, many different proteins will be individually analysed using a cell free assay, and secondly a global screen of protein N-glycosylation will be performed in a cell culture based system. This combination will allow us to classify as many proteins as possible, and the resulting dataset will be analysed using bioinformatic approaches to identify common features/motifs. Predicted interacting motifs that prove to be characteristic of ribophorin I dependent substrates will be experimentally validated using a combination of chimeras and targeted mutagenesis. Finally, in vitro cross-linking will be exploited to follow the interaction of nascent glycoprotein precursors with the subunits of the OST complex. By combining cross-linking with siRNA mediated depletion of ribophorin I or STT3A, we will establish at what stage of the N-glycosylation pathway ribophorin I acts to facilitate the process and additionally seek to identify key regions of ribophorin I that mediate its role in substrate presentation at the OST.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>357840</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Proteins are one of the key building blocks that make up the cells of our body and many important proteins are in fact &amp;quot;glycoproteins&amp;quot;, that is they have strings of sugar residues attached to them. These sugar polymers, or oligosaccharides, are often essential for the protein to work correctly, and if the oligosaccharides are not added, or not properly formed, this can result in health problems and specific diseases. Understanding the glycosylation of proteins is also an extremely important part of our ability to produce biopharmaceuticals based on natural glycoprotein products, for example recombinant forms of blood clotting factors. One of the major types of oligosaccharide added to proteins is the so-called &amp;quot;N-linked&amp;quot; variety, and there is a complex cellular machinery that makes such glycoproteins. In more complicated cells, such as those of our body, N-linked glycoproteins are made at a specialised location within the cell - a membrane enclosed compartment known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The cellular machinery responsible for protein N-glycosylation is the oligosaccharyltransferase, and it adds the N-linked glycans to growing protein chains as they are threaded into and across the ER membrane. Once completed the glycoproteins are then either delivered to the cell surface membrane or secreted from the cell. The oligosaccharyltransferase is made up of several different subunits, and the goal of our project was to try and understand how it works, and in particular define the function of particular subunits within the complex. 

For this study we have focussed on two subunits, ribophorin I and OST4. We first proved that OST4 really exists in human cells, since its occurrence was only theoretical before we started this project. We then took away ribophorin I or OST4 by blocking their production (using small interfering RNA) and asked what effect this had upon two things: 1) the stability of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex; 2) the capacity of the cells to N-glycosylate proteins. In both cases, we find that reduced levels of ribophorin I or OST4 result in a destabilisation of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and less efficient N-glycosylation of some proteins. Taken together, our data suggest that human cells have much more capacity to N-glycosylate proteins than is usually required. However, when normal levels of the machinery are artificially reduced,as we have done in this study, the N-glycosylation of some proteins is clearly affected yet for other proteins there is no effect. Thus, the sensitivity of different proteins to oligosaccharyltransferase levels is variable, and we speculate that this relates to complicated features such as exactly where N-linked glycans are added to a protein and how quickly the protein folds up as it is being made.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our studies highlight that in order to exploit protein N-glycosylation to our long-term benefit, we will need to understand the contributions of individual oligosaccharyltransferase subunits and specific features of the protein that is being N-glycosylated, ideally within the context of global cellular protein synthesis. Achieving these long-term goals will impact on both our understating of the molecular basis of diseases resulting from defects in protein N-glycosylation, and our ability to optimise the production of recombinant glycoproteins suitable for use as biopharmaceuticals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>15EC19ED-1B91-480F-AA7E-A0EFCC2E6E27</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc6b3a4653a9.95184489</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B27749AA-55F4-420D-BA8A-B516A2569DA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Eeyarestatin I inhibits Sec61-mediated protein translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of cell science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d8e99f97fb3a80c2d7ecb3ed4ab51a12"><gtr:id>d8e99f97fb3a80c2d7ecb3ed4ab51a12</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cross BC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9533</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546352b28e9f89.43505752</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD057EC8-862E-46D3-B8C8-E76A8389E4C4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Delivering proteins for export from the cytosol.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature reviews.
