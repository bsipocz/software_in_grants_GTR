keyboard instruments (i.e. pianos); electronic digital keyboards; synthesizers; and music
technology including both hardware and software. We will also create a new market for
instruments for digital music composition and performance. These markets as a whole are
now approximately $14bn per annum.
In the field of music, there is a growing divide between traditional and high-tech ways of
making music. On the one hand, traditional instruments have many inherent limitations built
into them, but are capable of great depth of expression. On the other hand, powerful new
digital ways of making music and editing sound have emerged that have changed the way
music is created, recorded, edited, and performed. Despite the benefits, these new
technologies are often:
? inaccessible without formal training
? difficult to integrate into a coherent system
? difficult to use in real-time
? generally time-consuming
? impossible to use a musically intuitive way
? costly despite having limited functionality
In sum, the digital revolution that has changed personal computing, phones, photography, and
many other fields has not yet fully come to fruition in the field of music production.
The Seaboard, based on patent-pending technology, will fill this unaddressed niche, by
solving these problems and bringing about a radical integration of these two previously
separate ways of making music.
In order to ensure that we take advantage of this opportunity, we aim to conduct enough
research to enable a first product version of the Seaboard to be sufficiently refined and include
the necessary minimum-function set for successful market entry. To do this, we need to
complete our proof of concept research, testing, and validation process before developing a
pre-production prototype.
We seek to deliver products that will change the way that people create music and put the
tools of high-quality music-making into more peoples hands. London in particular and the UK
in general is a world centre for design, music, and culture, and we believe that with the TSB's
help, we can make a contribution towards its growth as a global hotspot for innovation.
Completing our key objectives for proof of concept will put us in position to create a preproduction
prototype to a specification that is based on evidence from potential customers.
We need to bridge the gap between our current stage of innovation and where we need to be
to optimize the feature and specification set for market entry, and the TSB ?proof of concept?
grant would help us enormously to do this.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710025</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
