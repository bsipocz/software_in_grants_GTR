This is placing unprecedented pressure on global WEF resources, a situation that will be exacerbated with a shifting climate. To meet this demand and to ensure long-term WEF security there is a need for integrated, efficient, and sustainable resources management across the sectors. This is essential to enhance and maintain quality of life, and requires the overall system to adapt over appropriate timescales. Analogous to the human immune system, resilience can be enhanced by learning from shocks to the WEF nexus that lead to recovery and adaptation through improving the systems long-term memory. Through shocks to the system (vaccination in this analogy), society is provided the opportunity to improve resilience and sustainable management of the WEF sectors. In this context, shocks are represented by: 1) historic events, 2) controlled experimental manipulation, and 3) defined inputs to models. This project will identify the interconnections between Water Energy and Food (WEF) through the development of an integrated framework and will reveal the vulnerabilities in the system and the diverse connections between the three facets of the nexus. The project consists of three work packages (WPs) that cover a diverse array of scenarios for both aquatic and terrestrial systems integrated with a social science and economic modelling. In WP1 the response of aquatic food organisms to the shock of delivering the water and energy infrastructure plan will be investigated, culminating in the development of planning decision support tools based on integrated hydrodynamic and agent based models. WP2 will take an experimental, field based, and modelling approach to investigate the response of agriculture (focusing on soils and crops) to flooding under alternative climate change scenarios and based on historic data. The social aspects of shifting agricultural regimes, e.g. greater use of bioenergy crops in areas liable to flooding, will be investigated and quantified. WP3 will provide the social and economic modelling that will gather and analyse data obtained from the case studies and provide feedback to improve the models. Further, WP3 will investigate potential barriers to dissemination and uptake of the results within institutions and by end users that may benefit with the view to develop approaches that ameliorate for this. This work package is also dedicated to ensuring delivery of impact which will be enabled through close collaboration with several non-academic partners including industry. Delivery of the project will be managed by a team with diverse interdisciplinary expertise (including engineers, ecologists, agriculturalists, mathematicians, and social scientists) from the Universities of Southampton, Bath, London, Nottingham, Aberystwyth University, Loughborough University, University College London, HR Wallingford, and supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council. The team has a proven track record in project management, and strong links to industrial partners and other end users. The project will benefit industry, regulators, government, academia and the general public. The findings will be disseminated to: the academic community through publication of high impact research articles; the public through engagement via national and local media and internet and social networking platforms, and a structured Outreach programme involving schools and local science exhibitions; government through political outreach; and key stakeholders via relevant publications and participation in steering group workshops. The outputs will enable regulators to improve guidelines and to streamline the decision making processes for the benefit of industry and the nation as a whole.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The challenge of developing and maintaining sustainable Water-Energy-Food (WEF) systems is of national and international importance. The economic success of the UK over the next century will be influenced by todays strategic decisions on how to maintain WEF security and supply in the face of risks posed by ageing infrastructure, increased geopolitical insecurity, and climate change. The UK must successfully develop low carbon WEF sectors and protect biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. This project will have far-ranging and long-lasting impact through the benefit provided to industry, regulators, government, and the wider public. Primary beneficiaries are the energy, water, and food industry. WP1 will provide a water and energy infrastructure planning decision support tool that will enable the electricity generating and water supply sectors to better identify potential environmental impacts and shocks to aquatic provisioning ecosystem services (e.g. fisheries) of proposed infrastructures development. This will improve efficiency of planning and reduce costly delays in the consenting process (see RWE statement of support). Secondary industrial beneficiaries include consultants and other technical specialists tasked with conducting impact assessment and scenario planning for large-scale infrastructure projects. The regulator will benefit through enhanced quality and confidence of information on which decisions are made, thus improving the regulatory and consenting process (see Environment Agency statement of support). Government will benefit through greater capability of delivering the &amp;pound;466 Billion UK infrastructure plan essential to maintaining economic competitiveness and quality of life within the constraints of stringent environmental legislation (e.g. EU Water Framework Directive and Habitats Directive), while enhancing security of supply of water, energy, and food. WP2 will improve resilience of the UKs agriculture and bioenergy sectors in the faceof climate change and increased intensity and frequency of shocks (e.g. flooding, droughts, changes in policy). Potential agriculture response to climate shocks, including a potential shift to bioenergy crops, will be evaluated to improve understanding of how resilience may be enhanced. This will benefit the agriculture and bioenergy sectors and related industries, such as environmental consultancies, through the development of integrated modelling approaches that couple empirical (laboratory and field) evidence with numerical modelling of hydrological processes. Policy makers and regulators (e.g. Defra) will benefit from the evidence obtained from the scenario-based modelling. The modelling framework will help the regulators and policy makers with evidence-based decision making. WP 3 will enhance the project's outreach to government and institutional stakeholders by integrating econometric analysis and social science modelling to inform economic and governance audiences. WP3 will integrate all project elements and their different (social and natural) scientific approaches. WP3 will provide a model grounded in empirical observation to assess how project stakeholders 'learn' from nexus shocks to enhance resilience. This will provide guidance on the appropriate type and magnitude of shock mitigation and response. This is of direct value to industry, regulators, local government and national offices (e.g. the Civil Contingencies Secretariat). Stakeholders involved in the project will benefit from policy briefs and recommendations. Overall, the general public will benefit from a securer low-carbon water, energy, and food supply in the face of predicted shortages, reduced costs of more efficient and sustainable WEF systems, a less degraded and more resilient environment, and future benefits generated through the investment in transdisciplinary nexus research and the associated spin-offs to other academic disciplines.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1581409</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Terravesta Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Terravesta in Field Trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F287DFF-6BD5-4AE5-8CC9-AD086A2CB4FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Press releases and radio reports (see section on outreach)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c04050e028b7.95750101-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Terravesta provide the VTN team with information on their business, access to sites, reality checks during co-collaboration and idea generation, and opportunities for media outreach.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Terravesta (www.terravesta.com) are a supplier of the bioenergy crop (Miscanthus) to power generation companies.

Over four days the event attracted in excess of 100,000 visitors and was televised on the BBC's prime time Countryfile programme. The University of Southampton was the only science tent invited and we had the largest exhibition space. With a range of staff and students on hand to explain VTN research we found that engagement was extremely high with a long linger time, return visits and original visits due to word of mouth.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd642d4377e3.30744371</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nexus.soton.ac.uk/meetings-events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>VTN Southampton ABM workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>74749E1D-ACD6-4BAE-8C3A-8E9FBE0BCEDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In an effort to widen participation and provide added value to the VTN project this workshop was held in collaboration with the EPSRC funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Infrastructure Systems (CDT-SIS), the International Centre for Ecohydraulics Research (ICER), and the Institute for Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR). Participants discussed methods to quantify animal movement trajectories using a range of techniques including video analysis, particle tracking, hydroacoustics, and telemetry. The use of the data for the development of predictive tools, including Agent Based Models developed as part of the VTN project, was considered.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd68814f3355.77080275</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nexus.soton.ac.uk/meetings-events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Wales interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71364B35-8326-4B75-BAA6-96818E35E0F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Co-I at the University of Aberystwyth, Sarah Purdy, gave an interview to BBC Wales to disseminate information to the General Public on the possible use of Miscanthus on flood-prone land (15/01/16).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c03cf5ab17f8.35893451</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar given to DEFRA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>904E29C8-9BA1-42CC-BBFE-117782B43049</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-I from Cambridge, Shaun Larcom, provided a seminar for the Farm Business Unit at DEFRA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c03dc7306873.03059035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press Release Farmers Guide</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BE082E6-1765-43D2-B990-D017066E1F19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Farmers Guide Article prepared by the University of Aberystwyth on how Miscanthus trails could provide solution for flood problems of the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd69f7864103.39606010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nexus.soton.ac.uk/media/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paul Kemp BBC radio solent interview regarding the Nexus</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DEDB890-26AE-40F6-9880-74AABF7A0F34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The radio interview was to describe to the general public the challenges faced by society in the WEF NEXUS sphere and to explain the aims of this project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd6939138bf8.81121959</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nexus.soton.ac.uk/media/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>VTN Hockerton Housing Project Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>607B2258-0CD6-4AB6-8DD0-EA352AE4840A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The whole VTN team reconvened for the third workshop at the Hockerton Housing Project in Nottinghamshire. The workshops included a skype meeting with project partners at the Swedish University of Agriculture to discuss validation of the Agent Based Model. The VTN project engaged through discussions of NEXUS thinking with the staff on the sustainable housing project (commenced in 1998) which was designed to be sustainable and consists of five troglodyte earth sheltered homes with a heating system based on thermal mass storage, passive solar gain, and super-insulation and buffer zones. The small community generates electricity with two wind turbines, maintains its own water supply and waste water treatment, and produces much of its own food.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd6802dc5ba2.06536693</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nexus.soton.ac.uk/meetings-events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vaccinating the Nexus Website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7653ABB-539D-41C4-B9FD-ADF5649E9A39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of the Vaccinating the NEXUS project website.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c03e3b1dced0.95861717</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nexus.soton.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>36000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>RWE nPower</gtr:department><gtr:description>RWE nPower partial sponsorship of EPSRC funded CDT-Sustainable Infrastructure Systems (CDT-SIS) student</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>RWE AG</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1021EDDF-208E-467E-9786-4FE987A6077E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd62429370a7.91966346</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As part of the VTN project the University of Bath have developed an impedimetric sensor for monitoring the microbial activity in soils. They have also developed a self-powered sensor that informs on the quality of soils in terms of nutrients and eventual presence of toxic substances (e.g. pesticides). These tools inform on the healthiness of the soil after extreme climate shocks and assist informed decision on the crops to plant on a specific soil. We have tested the sensors in the lab with soil samples from Aberystwyth, in flooded/non flooded areas. We are now working at integrating the sensors with a wireless acquisition system to test the sensors in field and particularly in Tauton, along with commercial sensors installed by Loughborough University.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D017C58A-6B6B-4613-8B74-C4C359E72EAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Demonstration of the impacts of this tool has not yet been realised.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd93c0af78b4.34245416</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Soil sensors (University of Bath)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Universities of Southampton and Nottingham in collaboration with HR Wallingford are developing an Agent Based Model that can be integrated with hydrodynamics models (e.g. of rivers or estuaries) to predict the movement of eels at potential sites for infrastructure development. By developing this tool for the critically threatened European eel, as species listed by ICES, we will reduce the need to conduct studies using real animals thus impacting the 3Rs (see www.nc3rs.org.uk/3Rs). This will reduce the number of animals used and need to conduct invasive techniques (associated with telemetry) which can cause animal pain or stress.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A69A8BCD-B243-47AB-8502-B938E2232435</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is currently too early to demonstrate impact for this tool as it is still under development and evaluation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd956867a851.04195241</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Agent Based Model for eel movements at infrastructure</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://nexus.soton.ac.uk/research/</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AE0E16D8-59EB-4062-97E5-47535097FA5F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impedimetric paper-based biosensor for the detection of bacterial contamination in water</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/506fcc3ea2fcaa8815fbc23f4fdf252e"><gtr:id>506fcc3ea2fcaa8815fbc23f4fdf252e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rengaraj S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7a0ba93a589.27924336</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N005961/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
