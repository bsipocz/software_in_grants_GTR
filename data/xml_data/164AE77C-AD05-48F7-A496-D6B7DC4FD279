This is a 1-year proof-of-concept academia/industry joint development grant and we are developing ways to improve protein expression for the production of a range of pharmaceutical drugs, known as 'biologics'. These are protein-based drugs, and include artificial antibodies against a range of diseases, such as cancer. The methods we are developing are to improve the yield in industrial production and will be applied directly by the co-applicant pharmaceutical company, Lonza.

The current report is after 6 months into the grant and while we are on track with building the test systems specified in our application, we have not yet reached the testing phase. We are on target with a series of detailed milestones, which are judged formally by Innovate UK. 

Detailed Summary of work so far:

Synthetic gene networks are being tested to improve the yield of biologics. They consist of a gene encoding for biologics and genetic elements that induce or inhibit production of biologics, promoters and repressors respectively. The function of each synthetic network is validated by insertion into a commonly used manufacturing cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)) and the protein yield is assessed. In the first instance promoter and/or repressor combinations are being validated by expression of reporter proteins. These proteins are easy to detect and correlate with the function of gene networks. Such preliminary testing enables the refinement of promoter and/or repressor combinations. Optimised promoter/repressor combinations will be used subsequently to test expression of biologics.

Three gene network designs are being tested in parallel, each with increasing levels of risk, complexity and novelty. The first gene network uses a well-characterised system that has been shown to increase yields compared to standard manufacturing processes (Misaghi et al 2014). It comprises a promoter that is only active in the presence of chemicals called tetracyclines. At present, genetic material encoding the tetracycline promoter and reporter proteins have been synthesised. For real-world application, a gene encoding for biologics is due to be coupled to the tetracycline promoter.

The second gene network exploits endogenous promoters that are activated when cell populations are high, i.e. the stationary growth phase. Lonza provided data that characterises all promoters in their proprietary CHO cell line and this was used to successfully identify 10 candidate promoters. During this task it was also evident that phase promoters induce low levels of protein expression. Based on this new result we have designed two strategies to enhance expression. First, a synthetic enhancer has been incorporated into our gene network to increase production. Genetic material containing phase promoters, enhancers and reporter proteins have been constructed. An alternative gene network uses synchronised repressors to control protein expression. The first repressor mediates persistent inhibition of protein expression. The second repressor is coupled to a phase promoters and inhibits the first repressor. In this way, gene expression is only permitted during the stationary growth phase. Construction of this gene network is dependant on preliminary tests to identify a suitable phase promoter.

The final gene network aims to provide self-regulation of the industry standard manufacturing process. Current methods use promoters that induce persistent expression of biologics- a process associated with reduced yields. We aim to use endogenous promoters activated in response to high levels of protein to induce repressors. These molecular sensors should inhibit protein expression when levels are high, but become inactive when protein levels decrease. Literature evidence was used to identify 7 promoters that fit this profile. Genetic material containing promoters and repressors has been constructed. Validation of more complex synthetic gene networks is still ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is an industry development grant and is awarded 50%-50% with the pharma company Lonza, who will apply the results in their industrial pipeline for the production of biologics (e.g. antibody drugs).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E7139AEA-D3D2-4B64-A66B-3079F68123A1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d591e6abeb53.27022460</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M028933/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>18D298A9-FFE3-432F-B077-E3B703272E29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemical engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>11093A5C-4232-4625-96BA-FC7E5BA96CE2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Protein engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9031EBB8-791D-4466-9E80-80F98BCB26E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Protein expression</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
