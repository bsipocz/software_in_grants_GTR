The purpose of the network is to improve understanding of the historic, current, and potential roles that community music (hereafter CM) can play in promoting community engagement, within the terms of the AHRC's 'Connected Communities' initiative. Given that CM activity in the UK is currently negotiating a period of relative austerity, the network organisers see this as a crucial moment to critically reflect on the contemporary condition of CM and to revitalise understandings of its (potential) role in connecting communities. Such a revitalisation of understandings of CM stands to benefit not only the AHRC's 'Connected Communities' initiative but also to connect with the 'Big Society's emphasis on localism, voluntarism and community empowerment.

In the UK, CM has undergone significant shifts over recent decades. Undoubtedly, these shifts have been due - in no small part - to what Everitt (1997) has termed the 'subsidy revolution' facilitated by the funding opportunities made available by the National Lottery. One key development accompanying the upsurge in state funding has taken the form of 'increased expectation and an emphasis upon 'outcomes'' (Price 2002: 3). This has brought important changes in the ways those involved in facilitating CM activities both go about and think about their work, something perhaps most evident in the 'noticeable shift in focus...from collective to individual outcomes' (Matarasso 2007: 449). Such a shift is also indicative of a more subtle yet significant move away from CM's longstanding concern with issues of community empowerment, participatory processes and democratic decision-making practices (including learning about community-level decision making and grass-roots organisation processes). Such concerns, articulated within a broader philosophy of empowerment and reflected in the work of writers such as Saul Alinsky, Carl Rogers, Ivan Illich and Paolo Friere, were central to community development theorists and the burgeoning community arts movement of the late 1960s/early 1970s alike. Over time however, their centrality has been diminished for a CM movement which, as a recent AHRC 'Connected Communities' scoping study notes, has been primarily 'resource-oriented rather than actively reflexive' (McKay and Higham 2011: 6).

To date, this resource-orientation, on the part of CM managers and practitioners, has served to inhibit a productive dialogue between the former and those commissioning, funding and developing policy relevant to CM activity, with the result of obscuring the potential contribution of CM activity to community development. The formation of this research network, comprising of academics and researchers with expertise in the areas of informal music education and community cultural development (including the authors of the aforementioned AHRC scoping study), established CM funders and commissioners, experienced managers and respected practitioners will provide a forum within which to both explore the potentially valuable dimensions of CM for community development and formulate a future research agenda through which to respond to a series of core concerns facing CM initiatives in the UK.

The network organisers have developed a series of structured network events, engaging key stakeholders at appropriate junctures, in order to address issues including: 

- Individual and collective motivation to participation 
- CM participation as a pathway towards community engagement/activism 
- Evaluation of different models of developmental practice and community engagement 
- Community as a site of democratic expression and/or oppositional critique 
- Freedom and control in community engagement 
- Relationships between intent, process, and outcome in CM activity 
- Ethical issues in CM practice</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The knowledge exchange enabled by this network will generate a programme of research which will facilitate a deeper understanding of the respective constraints and opportunities facing different stakeholder groups - from policy makers and commissioners to CM practitioners on the ground - and lead to the development of responses capable of realising the full potential of CM activity in terms of community development. In placing particular emphasis on ways of enhancing CM's role in terms of participatory practices, democratic decision-making processes and community empowerment, the network's activities hold out the promise of impacting upon CM activity (and thereby communities) at the national and international level. 

There currently exists no national forum in which academics and researchers, CM commissioners, practitioners and funders share relevant expertise, knowledge and experience to address the challenges facing CM. This network will therefore provide a long-overdue integration of scholarly and stakeholder perspectives and a much-needed opportunity for each of the parties involved to benefit from the insights of the others through a programme of workshops (employing arange of techniques including nominal group technique and small group research approaches) addressing a series of core themes (as detailed above). Within the workshops, shared and/or contested understandings and creative approaches will be encouraged within the parameters of the network's stated objectives. 

It is expected that CM practitioners and organisations will gain insight into ways of most effectively focussing, representing and enhancing their activities at the level of community development and engagement. They stand to gain a stronger understanding of CM project participants' motivations to participation, the opportunity to integrate perspectives from community (cultural) development into their activities and to critically explore effective models of CM evaluation. At a time of restricted funding availability for CM activity, practitioners and managers will also gain new insights into methods of sustaining community-level cultural activity and enhancing levels of community control and decision-making. 

This project also has the potential to disclose to local authorities, other government agencies, institutions and relevant policy makers, a number of ways in which CM might best be supported to enhance its role in encouraging community development, sustainability and engagement in the UK. Specifically, commissioners, funders and policy makers will gain insight into the ways in which their funding criteria, practices and routines impact upon the nature of CM activity. CM stakeholders will thereby be positioned to think beyond prescriptions which have, to date, limited the potential benefits achievable through CM activity. In this regard, the impacts of the network's activity are also likely to be of benefit in terms of the practices and understandings of other community art forms.

Further, by involving representatives of a range of organisations, practitioners and researcher/academics operating in the UK, the network will lead to the development of bonds of collaboration with the potential to impact beyond the lifetime of this network. By also disseminating network findings through international fora (such as the Community Music Activity Commission of the International Society for Music Education), the impacts of this network's activities will be international in scope. 

Taken together, the impacts outlined above will serve to increase the effectiveness of CM in contributing to community development and cohesion. In particular, by examining the potential of CM activity to encourage stronger community engagement/activism and to embed knowledge of community organisation, deliberation and empowerment processes, the network has the potential to make a key contribution to the broader aims of the AHRC 'Connected Communities' programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24021</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Published article in 'Sounding Board' the journal of community music</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>22CA9132-E4C0-43EF-8C09-1A5FDAF776CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article was warmly received by journal editor.

? There remains no agreed definition of CM and a number of recent developments appear to have stretched already-catholic understandings of CM into a further expanded form. 
? Adopting a broad definition of CM enables a sense of unity across the profession and provides practitioners with the flexibility to tailor their CM activity to the requirements tied to different sources of funding. 
? Problematically however, this situation risks obscuring the aims underpinning CM activity, thereby leading to challenges in clearly communicating the value of CM to external constituencies.

Mythologies of Practice 
? There appears to be a degree of 'myth making' around understandings of intent, process and impact in CM activity. This occurs, it seems, in order to maintain as open as possible a view as to how initiatives might achieve outcomes. 

Quiet Radicalism 
? CM has traditionally claimed to draw on 'radical', 'activist' or broadly 'political' motivations. We found little evidence of this in delegates' accounts of contemporary practice. Rather, delegates provided accounts of how CM practice has come to accommodate itself to - and position its value in relation to - the agendas of formal service providers (in education, health and social services). 

Quality, evidence, and faith
? We encountered contested understandings of quality, evidence, and evaluation. This was reflected in discussions about 'excellence,' and differing views about the relative importance of 'process' and 'product.' Since it was unclear what was meant by 'quality', it was difficult to know what sorts of evidence might be sought to prove value. 
? There seems to be a risk of confusing evaluation with advocacy. Evaluation should be independent and neutral, carrying a risk of uncovering failure; whereas advocacy is all about presenting the best possible case, and, if necessary, suppressing bad news.

Pathways to an elusive consensus 
? We encountered a persistent difficulty in drawing together the views of participants into a consistent, coherent account of CM and its activities and practices. The only consistency lay in the diversity of experience. The reluctance to be defined functions as a more or less deliberate strategy for keeping artistic, and most importantly commercial, options open.

The Role of Research 
? CM appears to lack either the terminological or pedagogical specificity through which to explain its processes to the uninitiated. As a consequence, potentially valuable dimensions of its practice and outcomes are often not effectively communicated to wider constituencies. 
? The field's longstanding resistance to definition and articulation appears to play into the current lack of understanding - both from within and without - of the core processes and mechanisms used in CM.
? The current lack of precise and clear analyses of the processes and mechanisms enacted within CM projects, and of the ways these variably connect with different outcomes in different contexts, therefore leaves the field unable to offer anything but an underspecified accounts of its benefits.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this research project should inform future research on the development of community music practice in the UK.
