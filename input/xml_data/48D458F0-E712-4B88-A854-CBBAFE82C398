As such it is universal and can be a means of bridging disparate areas. Some examples of groups are the integers (with addition), the symmetries of a polyhedron (with composition of symmetries) or the fundamental group of paths on a surface. To understand these abstract objects, we need to represent a group in some way. We do this by considering it as a collection of transformations of space. The group may already have natural representations, as happens often in physics, e.g., orthogonal groups, or they may be obscure and involve transformations of very high dimensional spaces (for example the 'monster' sporadic group requires a 196,883 dimensional space). Further we need to study not just one representation of a group, but the entirety of the representations of that group. An object capturing this information is a module category. 

Our interest is in the modular representations of a group, that is those over a field of prime characteristic p. Here it makes sense to refine our module category. Instead of studying the group itself, we study its blocks. Study of the module category of a group amounts to study of the module category of each block in turn. An invariant associated to a block is its defect group. In a block with trivial defect group all representations are essentially sums of copies of a single representation, but the structure of representations of a block of large defect can be very complex. 

We compare module categories of blocks using Morita equivalence. Morita equivalent module categories are in a sense 'the same'. A fundamental question is addressed by Donovan's conjecture, posed in the 1970's, which predicts that for a fixed defect group there are only finitely many Morita equivalence classes of blocks. Donovan's conjecture is both simple and fundamental to our perception of the subject. If it is true, then in theory we could classify module categories of blocks, whilst if it is false, then the subject is even wilder and more unpredictable than we imagined.

The PI, in a recent paper with Kessar, K&amp;uuml;lshammer and Sambale, gave a classification up to Morita equivalence of blocks of quasisimple groups with abelian defect groups when the prime p is 2. This is a tremendous tool not only for verifying cases of Donovan's conjecture, but for going further and classifying the Morita equivalence classes of blocks with a given defect group. This has been done in very few meaningful cases and doing so would shine a light in an area which is currently very dark. 

A large part of this proposal is to exploit the above paper to give precise descriptions of the Morita equivalence classes in a range of cases, as well as to prove Donovan's conjecture in an even wider range of cases. It is also to investigate the general phenomenon of Morita equivalence between blocks of finite groups, particularly in the situation of Galois conjugate blocks as considered by Kessar. Here the situation is very mysterious, in that there exist Galois conjugate blocks (which are almost indistinguishable) that are not Morita equivalent. This will involve some algebraic number theory, and is crucial to our understanding of Donovan's conjecture.

The principal outcome of the project will be detailed information on Morita equivalence classes, providing an invaluable resource for future research. A website will be constructed to make this detailed information available and to record progress on Donovan's conjecture and the classification of Morita equivalence classes in general. 

The project involves knowledge of finite groups of Lie type, of homological algebra, number theory, group theory and representation theory, and will benefit from collaborations with the strong algebra community both in the UK and outside.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the primary aim of the project within representation theory will be concrete. There is little data on the diversity of Morita equivalence types amongst wild blocks of finite groups, as is evidenced by the fact that the main, and longstanding, conjecture in this direction only asks whether there are finitely many (for a given defect). Taking advantage of tools only recently available we will produce detailed information on possible Morita equivalence types for a range of p-groups, providing a useful data resource for the algebra community. This data will be kept on a website, which will also include a record of progress in the area.

We hope to help direct future activity by beginning the exploitation of this resource ourselves, refining conjectures involving the invariants related to Morita equivalence, for example the Cartan matrix. 

The proposal includes a workshop to be held in 2016. This is intentionally early in the project, so that it will bring together potential collaborators beyond those already identified and create a focus on the application of the classification of finite simple groups to Donovan's conjecture and related problems. Collaboration will be an important part of the project, with the attendant knowledge transfer and exchange of ideas. 

The question of the relationship between Galois conjugacy and Morita equivalence is also fundamental, and is not yet receiving the attention it deserves. The problem involves algebraic number theory, and the proposed engagement with number theorists has the potential to transform our understanding.

Long term impact is hard to predict, but one pathway is as follows. In the medium term the proposed research will feed into the large effort to understand global-local determination in blocks. A global-local theory would have potential for wide applications because it allows the reduction of problems to simple local situations. Such situations could arise whenever symmetry is involved.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>317853</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Morita equivalence workshop, Lausanne</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD1F6372-5FB0-4348-A822-4950355C1E89</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop titled &amp;quot;Morita equivalence problems for blocks of finite groups&amp;quot;. 5 day workshop forming part of &amp;quot;Local representation theory and finite groups&amp;quot; semester at the BIC, EPFL, Lausanne.
