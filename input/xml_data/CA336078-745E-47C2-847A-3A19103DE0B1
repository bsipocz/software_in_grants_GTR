care: the critical role of carers and other adults is a seminar series involving the University of Oxford (Rees Centre for Research in Fostering and Education, Department of Social Policy and Intervention), Institute of Applied Social Research, University of Bedfordshire and Department of Social Work, University of Gothenburg. The shortage of carers willing to foster teenagers is particularly acute. Specific challenges include offending, sexual exploitation and asylum seekers. The seminar series will develop a new research network to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Influence policy and practice by engaging practitioners, foster carers, care-experienced young people, service providers, researchers and policy makers in an interactive programme&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Develop a new international research agenda on fostering teenagers by bringing together different disciplines (social work, social policy, education, psychology, sociology, criminology, law) and countries&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Improve understanding of the concept of parenting: it will explore and clarify concepts of parenting and their relationship with foster parenting&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Take a lifespan perspective: it will focus upon teenage parenting and fostering and how this relates to earlier and later parenting and fostering focusing on the longer term effects.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Each seminar will be a full day for 40 people. Postgraduate students will present posters that will go on the web.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The applicants have ongoing involvement in public, independent and voluntary sector organisations providing direct opportunities to influence practitioners and policy makers with the outcomes. User engagement maximizes both the relevance of the research outside academia and thereby its impact (Rickinson et al., 2011). Interactive activities help move beyond dissemination to impact.
 The applicants work with social workers, youth workers, psychologists, therapists, teachers, health workers and policy leaders/strategists. The applicant is a member of the British Association of Adoption and Fostering Research Group and of the Association of Directors of Children's Services Research User Group giving her direct access to key service providers. The Rees Centre Advisory Group includes senior government, charity and local authority officials who will be invited to attend and/or speak at selected seminars. 
 The Rees Centre consults groups of care leavers, foster carers and social workers in two local authorities and one independent provider every 3-6 months throughout the research process and will do the same with the seminar series. More than 20 foster carers are participating as co-researchers in our work. The seminar participants will be drawn from these communities to ensure the outcomes are interactively communicated to others. Research findings are presented to key organisations and charities regularly including NSPCC, Barnardos, National Children's Bureau and The College of Social Work. 
 The Department of Social Work at the University of Gothenburg is involved in social work training and works closely with a foster care case workers' organization and two foster carer organisations in Sweden. The Department of Education at Oxford is involved in training and Masters level professional development of teachers. The Doctoral Training Centre at Oxford involves both departments thereby ensuring that doctoral students are involved in the seminars and that the outcomes are reflected in the doctoral teaching.
 The Faculty of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Bedfordshire is accredited for training in both social work and youth and community studies. Prof Pearce works as a policy advisor with Eurochild and with The Council of Europe 'One in Five' Campaign which is extending its work to review participatory methods used to engage children and young people in preventing sexual violence against children. She attends the UK Government roundtable events implementing the current Challenging Child Sexual Exploitation Strategy and is evaluating the Barnardo's provision of DfE funded work on specialist foster care arrangements for sexually exploited and trafficked young people. 
 A dedicated webpage and blog encouraging interaction will be developed. Each seminar will be streamed enabling interactive involvement from users elsewhere. A summary of each seminar will be placed on the website, comments sought and key points used in presentations with policy makers and practitioners. At every seminar postgraduate students from different disciplines will present poster sessions (then placed on the web) and be invited to co-author papers with the presenters and planning team. 
 A short booklet on fostering teenagers for foster carers drawing on the seminar outcomes, (co-authored with carers attending) will be published. Prior to publication, carers and care leavers will contribute which will encourage impact through discussion of implications and practical suggestions. Making Research Count at the University of Bedfordshire will promote the outcomes through newsletters, research summaries, workshops and events. 
 Prof H&amp;ouml;jer will involve Nordic researchers, fostering organisations and social work professional associations in the development of the series from the outset thus maximising dissemination and impact. Some outputs may be produced in Swedish as well as English (in particular for users).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30342</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Gothenburg</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sweden, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Social Work</gtr:department><gtr:description>Fostering Teenagers</gtr:description><gtr:id>0ACCFD5C-F0B4-48E6-A784-710CF3D346DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing editing of special edition of Child and Family Social Work</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c54a7e644143.02407892-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>collaborator on seminar series and outputs</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Prof Ingrid H&amp;ouml;jer, University of Gothenburg.

1. The handbook for foster carers reflects the key findings and was published on 19 Jan 2017 electronically and in hard copy. Over 6000 copies have been distributed through key national organisations for foster carers in the two countries including The Fostering Network, FosterTalk and organisations in Sweden. Every local authority in England received multiple copies through the national bailout from Coram/BAAF a charity partner in the original seminar series. Copies have been requested by fostering providers in Scotland and Australia following use of web resources. Possible translations into Swedish and Japanese are being explored. Regular Rees Centre foster carer meetings, the Rees newsletter (circulation 1200) and Making Research Count at University of Bedfordshire have all promoted the handbook.

2. The section in the handbook on fostering asylum seekers attracted particular attention around the time of the national outcry on the Dubs agreement. One of our researchers had a blog from the handbook published in Guardian Society on-line and this was picked up by Sky News who did a 5-minute interview with her.

3. Policy makers in DfE have been given a specific briefing on the series findings and have discussed how to incorporate the findings into their guidance and resource allocation. Their deputy director spoke about this at the launch of the handbook and they have referenced the Handbook in the Fostering Stocktake they are undertaking.

4. The researcher for the Education Select Committee attended the launch of the Handbook and is now providing the background briefing for their inquiry into fostering which will reference it.

5. A special edition of the Journal of Child and Family Social Work is being published in 2017 with open access for non-academics. We have been working with the non-academic partners mainly young people who have grown up in care who participated in the seminar series who have written commentaries on how the issues raised resonate with their experience - this has affected their practice including what they have told other young people who they mentor and is likely to affect practitioners once the publication becomes available.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>649D19F8-57ED-4044-B8AB-33E56976CDBE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c23874416031.76788777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Emerging findings are summarised, recordings of presentations and post-graduate posters at: http://reescentre.education.ox.ac.uk/research/teenagers-in-foster-care/. 

A handbook for foster carers on Fostering Teenagers was published on 19 January informed by the findings e.g. that a strengths-based approach is important. Over 6000 copies have been distributed including to every local authority in the country. The Guardian Society online carried a blog https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2017/feb/15/fostering-a-teenage-asylum-seeker-was-challenging-and-fun
and Sky News broadcast a feature http://news.sky.com/video/one-womans-experience-of-fostering-a-young-asylum-seeker-10770454 on the fostering unaccompanied asylum seeker teenagers section of the work.

A special edition of 'Child and Family Social Work' will be published on-line June 2017, initially with open access. Findings reported here will be reflected in both and the impact report in late 2016 will cover both. 

New understandings generated by the seminar series

Finding 1: Theoretical perspectives on the relationship between parenting, adolescence and fostering were advanced through key research being brought together.
Research on parenting (Gardner), adolescence (Coleman) and fostering (Schofield) were brought together with perspectives from foster carers and teenagers in care. Similarities and differences between parenting and fostering teenagers were identified. Foster carers noted the enhanced accountability expected of them and the multiple and sometimes conflicting identities of carers. Coleman set out the characteristics of parenting relationships (e.g. expectations, consistency, strong boundaries). 

Finding 2: Foster carers and professionals need more support on maximising autonomy while minimising risk. 
Balancing risk with autonomy emerged as a major challenge from the seminars on sex and relationships, youth justice and transition to adulthood. Presentations included Berelowitz's 'warning signs' for foster carers to identify child sexual exploitation and Shuker's model for securing safety. Kohli provided a conceptual model of how unaccompanied asylum seekers make journeys geographically over time (through countries of origin, transit, asylum, and settlement), as well as developmentally as they mature into adulthood en route. 

Finding 3: Research is needed on care leavers' social networks and access to social capital to address identity, loneliness, homelessness, mental health, employment, etc.
The importance for all teenagers of identity and belonging and the effects of instability in exacerbating vulnerabilities emerged as key issues. Care leavers reported on feelings of loneliness and anxiety and difficulties in coping with memories of trauma, neglect or abuse even when their lives were stable. Stein suggested rights-based approaches might protect them from the effects of austerity programmes. 

Finding 4: Training for social workers, foster carers, other professionals and policy makers should privilege the perspectives of care experienced young people.
The perspectives of the care experienced young people at each seminar were particularly welcomed. They identified the negative impact of frequent social worker changes, lack of access to education, the need to have someone to 'let down' and importance of feeling safe, even to the extent that Thomas described having wanted a longer prison sentence that provided relative safety.

A new interdisciplinary research network has been established through connecting scholars, practitioners and policy makers across England and Sweden and this group is involved in working on the journal special edition. 

Directions for future research were identified such as:

? Evaluation of training for foster carers in authoritative parenting;
? Longitudinal study of the outcomes of fostered asylum seeking young people, what worked for them, what could have been better, what were they able to achieve?
? Evaluating approaches to leaving care provision in different countries and how these promote resilience for both highly motivated and disengaged individuals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Network members will work with key organisations, fostering providers and government officials in England and Sweden to translate the findings into policy and practice. 

1. The handbook for foster carers reflects the key findings and is available electronically and in hard copy. Distribution through key national organisations for foster carers in the two countries including The Fostering Network, FosterTalk and organisations in Sweden.
