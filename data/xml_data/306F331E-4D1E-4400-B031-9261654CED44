the desert locust</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/H002537/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Animals may undergo profound changes in their behaviour, body shape and colour in response to varying environmental conditions. This poses a major problem in biology: how do the surroundings in which an animal lives, influence the expression of its genes and mould its brain function, its hormones, and hence its behaviour, so that it is appropriately adapted to changing circumstances. The Desert Locust shows an extreme example of this malleability; it can change reversibly from a shy and inconspicuous, solitary creature that flies at night to one that is highly conspicuous, day flying and occasionally aggregates in vast numbers which has devastating economic effects. These two forms - the solitarious and gregarious phases - are strikingly different in appearance, physiology and behaviour. They can be bred in the laboratory and made to switch from one phase to the other and back, by simply raising them in isolation or in a crowd. They have relatively few nerve cells in their brain so that it is possible to understand the changes that occur during these phase transitions and to illuminate the similar mechanisms that occur in more complex animals when they find themselves in new circumstances. The key decision a locust must make is to join with or avoid other locusts. Once this has been made subsequent changes in physiology, body shape and colour follow from the continuing presence or absence of other locusts. Tickling the hind legs of a solitarious locust to mimic the effects of jostling with others, or the sight and smell of other locusts, can, in 1-2 h, cause the behaviour to become gregarious. This transition is accompanied by substantial changes in the amounts of many chemicals in its nervous system. In particular serotonin (a substance that in human brains affects many moods such as aggression and depression, and the release of which is affected by drugs such as ecstasy) shows a large but short-lived increase and, critically, it is both necessary and sufficient to induce the change in behaviour. We have determined which nerve cells show changes in their serotonin levels. We now wish to understand how serotonin changes the workings of nerve cells to bring about the transformation of behaviour. To achieve this aim we have these key objectives: 1. Identify and characterise the nerve cells that change their production of serotonin during the initial change in behaviour. How far do they extend through the central nervous system? How do they respond in the presence of other locusts, and what effects do they have on other nerve cells to bring about changes in behaviour? 2. Identify the nerve cells that are influenced by the release of serotonin. What chemical changes does serotonin cause in the internal workings of these nerve cells? This will be examined at the level of specific molecules that engage in cascades of chemical reactions to pass information within one cell and to neighbours. 3. Serotonin can change the effectiveness and the time course of communication between nerve cells, providing an essential building block of learning. How do differing amounts of serotonin in the nervous system before, during and after the experience of crowding, affect communication between nerve cells? Does serotonin have different effects in solitarious and gregarious locusts? 4. Examine in detail how solitarious and gregarious locusts differ in their patterns of daily activity such as feeding, exploring their environment and sleeping, and begin to look at how genes that regulate their body clock differ in the two phases. 5. Gregarious locusts quickly revert to solitarious behaviour if they are removed from the crowd. What are the mechanisms that maintain their gregarious behaviour and what is the complimentary process that leads to solitarious behaviour?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>How does the interplay between the environment and gene expression mould brain function and behaviour so that an animal can adapt to changing circumstances? Desert Locusts show an extreme form of this phenotypic plasticity by changing from a shy animal, cryptic in appearance and avoiding other locusts, to one that lives in large groups, has bright warning colours as nymphs and is actively attracted to other locusts. We wish to capitalise on our recent breakthrough in identifying serotonin (5HT) as underlying the transformation from solitarious to gregarious behaviour, and our identification of neurons that up-regulate 5HT within 1 h of receiving gregarizing stimuli. We wish to build on these data by using a systems approach to identifying the sequence of processes, at molecular, cellular and neural levels that link the increased release of 5HT with changes of neuronal function and behaviour in this tractable model. We have these key objectives: 1. Characterise the anatomy and physiology of the individual serotonergic neurons that up-regulate 5HT production during behavioural gregarization. 2. Identify the targets of 5HT-mediated plasticity during phase change. We will determine: the targets of PKA phosphorylation both i) at the cellular level by identifying the anatomical location of neurons affected by gregarization and ii) at the molecular level, within neurons. 3. Determine how altered physiological function underlies the changes associated with behavioural gregarization. We will analyse how serotonin affects the physiology of identified neurons, before, during and after phase change. 4. Determine the behavioural consequences of phase change on circadian rhythms and aggregation. 5. Determine how the gregarious phase is maintained and how it is lost during the process of behavioural solitarization that occurs when gregarious locusts are isolated from the crowd.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>479469</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>SRO created a set of popular science images that illuminate the intricate structure of the locust brain and its relation to the body.

We have entered a Partnership with the Algerian Direction General de la Recherche Scientifique et D&amp;eacute;veloppement Technologique (DGRSDT) that was facilitated through Dr. Mohamed Boudjelal at GlaxoSmithKline Services Unlimited.



The aims of this partnership are

1. To test our discoveries of the mechanism of gregarization (which were made in locusts from long-term laboratory cultures) on locusts from wild populations, both in laboratory experiments and under quasi-field conditions.

2. To develop laboratories in Algeria to meet the needs of Algerian and international scientists to study the underlying mechanisms of phase change in locusts and ultimately to develop better control strategies.

3. To hold an international workshop in Algeria that will bring together scientists working on locust biology and control.

4. To form an international network of scientists, starting with the partnership with the University of Cambridge. Funding would be available from our Ministry for aspects of work in Algeria, with the network eventually applying for international grants.

5. To enable reciprocal knowledge transfer and training and extend the research partnership towards the education of the next generation of Algerian scientists.



Burrows and Rogers were guests of the Direction General de la Recherche Scientifique et D&amp;eacute;veloppement Technologique, Minist&amp;egrave;re de L'enseignement Sup&amp;eacute;rieure et la Recherche Scientifique, Algeria, during an official visit from February 27th to March 3rd 2010.



As part of the programme, Rogers addressed an interdepartmental meeting of the Algerian government in Algiers. The trip also involved a journey down into the deep Sahara to a new locust research facility being built near the city of Tamanrasset.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sydney</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with University of Sydney, Australia</gtr:description><gtr:id>5A546C33-F06C-4731-A187-28BC680B216F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9607818b960782c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The Cambridge team around SR, MB and SRO have a long-standing collaboration with the research group of Professor Steve Simpson at the University of Sydney, Australia.

1. We found that Protein Kinase A (PKA), a signalling protein implicated in various forms of learning in other animals, has been co-opted to control the transition to gregarious behaviour in locusts. A specific drug that inhibits PKA interferes with this transition, but not with gregarious behaviour established through prolonged crowding. Significantly, we were able to demonstrate that PKG, which has been implicated as a candidate mechanism in previous research, has no role in the transition. The 'learning' protein PKA thus acts as a molecular switch in a social feedback loop, because gregarious behaviour ensures that crowding is maintained. Our results indicate that the biochemical mechanisms that trigger locust swarming are similar to what enables humans and other animals to respond to novel experiences, including social change.

2. We found that living in dense groups has a dramatic effect on the size and structure of the locusts' brain. Despite being smaller than solitary locusts, swarming locusts develop brains that are 30% larger. In solitary locusts the parts of the brain that deal with vision and smell are proportionately larger, possibly helping them to detect faint or distant stimuli, whereas in the swarming locust huge increases in size occur in the parts of the brain associated with learning and processing complex information.

3. By using microarray technology, we have identified 214 genes that are differentially expressed in the nervous system of solitarious and gregarious locusts, and whose altered expression may therefore be implicated in bringing about swarming behaviour and/or enable locusts of either phase to deal with the different challenges they face. These include genes encoding proteins that are associated with nervous system development and plasticity, sensory perception, and the response and resistance to stress.

4. We have developed two novel complementary paradigms for assessing how locusts learn to associate food with odours. A key advantage is that, unlike with previous paradigms, locusts are restrained during training, thus allowing precise control of the learning parameters. We have identified the palp opening response (POR) as a new behavioural measure of acquisition of an olfactory Pavlovian association.

5. We have identified and characterised (i) a long-latency ingestion-dependent learning mechanism that enables locusts to avoid odours associated with poisonous food, and (ii) differences in aversive learning between solitarious and gregarious locusts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As outlined in the previous section, two findings in particular have potential for non-academic exploitation in the development of new control strategies for pest insects:

(1) Our identification of a critical role of PKA in the transition to swarming behaviour may open up the development of novel, locust-specific control agents that avoid the collateral effects on other organisms.

(2) The discovery and characterisation of a mechanism by which locusts associate odours with the ingestion of toxic food could be used to reduce the loss of insecticide efficacy that arises from the insects' acquiring learned behavioural avoidance of baits. Our identification of a critical role of PKA has considerable potential for exploitation in the development of new locust control agents: downstream components of PKA signalling in locusts may have sufficiently distinct genetic sequences and protein structures to present targets for locust-specific control strategies that interfere with the transition to swarming behaviour.

Behavioural resistance through food avoidance learning is a major efficacy limiter of oral insecticides. Our discovery and characterisation of a long-latency aversive learning mechanism that is activated by the ingestion of toxic food has implications for the control of locusts and other pest insects. 

Locusts are a powerful model system for answering the question of how brains process odour information. What has precluded extending this research to how brains learn about the meaning of odours was the lack of a paradigm for training and testing learning in restrained locusts. To quote Aldworth &amp;amp; Stopfer (2012, Current Biology) , &amp;quot;[Our] recent development of a behavioral paradigm for assessing associative learning in locusts will allow researchers to tackle these problems from physiology to behavior in a single animal. This will be an important step to understanding the formation of associative memories.&amp;quot;</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6837BEFA-BED4-463F-869E-54BEEA028E02</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4561979374.440368774b09ee</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Development of advanced level electrophysiology training material</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD64658D-FC53-4120-906E-7808F60BCD0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Course provides advanced training in electrophysiological techniques underpinning in vivo research to 6 PhD level researchers per year.

R. Soc. Lond. B). A single locust is placed in a rectangular arena facing a group of conspecifics on one side and observed to record several behavioural parameters. By applying multivariate binary logistic regression, these parameters are used to define a statistical model that yields the probability of being gregarious for an animal of unknown phase state. In the past, the behavioural parameters were obtained using manual event recording software, which is highly laborious and yields observer-dependent results. Some recent studies have therefore employed automated video tracking in closed-source commercial software, which however lacks transparency as to how the behavioural parameters are derived.

To overcome these disadvantages we developed a computerised assay that comprises a modified arena and GNU open-source software components under Linux. The behaviour of the animal in the arena is recorded on digital video using Coriander and ffmpeg software. The position and orientation of the animal is then tracked off-line in SwisTrack.

We developed GNU Octave code to calculate 25 behavioural parameters from the frame-by-frame positional and orientation information. Based on data from about 150 long-term solitarious and 150 long-term gregarious fifth-instar locusts, four behavioural parameters (time spent near stimulus group, fractal dimension, number of jumps, number of long walk bouts) were carefully selected to define the logistic regression model. The model correctly classifies over 90% of locusts with a known rearing history into their respective phases and can be used to objectively predict the unknown phase state of an experimental animal. The assay is completely transparent and can be easily used and modified by others.</gtr:description><gtr:id>19F28802-6AD2-4F2B-A886-8B952A4E8574</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research method has been adopted by the research group of Prof. Jozef Vanden Broeck at KU Leuven, Belgium.
