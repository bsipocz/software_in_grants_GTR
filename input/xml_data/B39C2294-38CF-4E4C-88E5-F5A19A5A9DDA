The LIVITY study was established to answer questions on HIV acquisition and risk behaviours and found evidence of high risk sexual behaviours present among both HIV-positive and -negative black Caribbean participants, frequent sexual contact in the Caribbean or with recent migrants from the Caribbean in the UK, highlighting a potential overlap with the HIV epidemic in the Caribbean. 

The main aim of this study is to further characterise HIV within the black Caribbean community by integrating results from questionnaires and interviews in order to increase understanding of the reasons behind behaviours. Data can also be used to parameterise mathematical models of HIV transmission to explore the importance of different risk behaviours and the geographic movement between the UK and Caribbean. In addition, they will help to identify and evaluate interventions, aimed to reduce risky sexual behaviours or by treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy, to prevent further spread of HIV within this community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The potential for an HIV epidemic in the UK black Caribbean community (BCC) is of major public health concern. The LIVITY study, established 2004, was the first comprehensive study of HIV-1 infection in the BCC in south London. Key results were the: high proportion of HIV acquisition in the UK; overlap with the HIV epidemic in the Caribbean through sexual contact in the Caribbean and/or with recent arrivals from the Caribbean; high proportion of heterosexuals reporting risky sexual behaviours including sexual debut &amp;lt;16 years old, recent concurrent partnerships, and high number of lifetime sexual partners. Qualitative interviews highlighted the profound impact of stigma on sexual behaviours, disclosure and coping strategies. 

The principal aim of this project is to build upon these initial findings from the LIVITY study, and to utilise additional datasets and several methodological approaches to fully characterise the current status, likely future course and impact of HIV in the BCC in south London and UK. A key hypothesis is that the HIV epidemic among the BCC is driven by a core group of HIV-positive Caribbeans with risky sexual behaviours, and sexual contact with recent HIV-positive BC migrants. 

The main data sources to be used are: (i)LIVITY: clinic-based quantitative and qualitative study of BC HIV-positive patients and STD clinic attendees: (ii)Caribbean sexual Health in south-east London (CHIL): community-based quantitative and qualitative study of sexual behaviour, knowledge and attitudes of recent BC UK migrants; (iii) NATSAL 2000: population study of sexual attitudes and behaviours. 

Specific objectives are to: (i)analyse and integrate LIVITY and CHIL data to develop an enriched dataset; (ii)undertake a mixed-methods analysis through the construction and analysis of a metamatrix, containing full information from all data sources on sexual behaviours, HIV disclosure and support-seeking behaviours, providing a description of current behaviours AND explanations/settings for them; (ii)estimate HIV prevalence in the BCC in the UK through Bayesian statistical projections using several national datasets; (iv)Use data from (i)-(iii) to develop mathematical models to further understand and predict the likely pattern of ongoing HIV transmission in this population. Modelling work will build on the existing repertoire of deterministic-compartmental models, pair-wise models and individual-based simulations for HIV transmission, and used to explore the importance of high-risk groups, movement of people between the Caribbean and the UK and partnership dynamics in the propagation of BC HIV epidemic. In addition, the impact of strategies including STI treatment and partner notification/screening will be investigated.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>368035</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>HSV-1 incidence estimation in the US non-institutionalised civillian population.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D73811F8-E881-4F54-99A8-935C001DD65B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project is still active but shall result in a paper in a high impact medical journal.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>Zke2AERZ5A4-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CDC provided data on the seroprevalence of HSV-1 in children and adults in the US for the last 20 years.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The team that I have put together for this collaboration have written code for a mathemtical model in order to estiamte the incidence of HSV-1 in the non-institutionalised civillian population in the US.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Public Health England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mathematical model of HIV-1 in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:id>20AD6FF6-18F0-4228-A285-FB79E2B1D074</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet, due to the change over from HPA to PHE, the collaboration was slow to start and so is ongoing, with no research outputs produced.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>EqKa1dXcTri-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Currently the provision of national HIV data.

Imperial College had six research groups present, three in the afternoon and three in the evening. I was part of one of the research groups in the evening, engaging with the public about HIV. We have a global map of HIV prevalence with facts about each of the epidemics, an interactive electronic survey on sexual behaviours which the public took part in, and whose results were compared with UK's and Zimbabwe's national averages, as well as, a &amp;quot;fact or myth&amp;quot; section. All of these props were thee in order to engage with the public, who mostly just asked us all questions about how sexual behaviours data is collected, what we do with it and the current situation of the HIV epidemic in the UK,

The Imperial College section was busier this year than ever before, with engagement with people of all ages, and we received good feedback from the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>A9q9eaBDCGV</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Primary school visit (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6206807A-7428-4322-9E1D-8244B6E243CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We worked with two classes of 30 children in year 5 for a week, with illustration, art and an animated film being created around the circulation system. I was the scientist on the project who gave each class a morning of scientific teaching and experiments, which were fun and sparked the children imaginations. The project covered 3 schools, of which I was involved in one school.

This was a pilot project, with each school creating something permanent, like the animated film. There is hope that this will be further developed to help with the transition from primary to secondary scientific education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>ntqvF94n62R</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science and Silence.

Their was a panel discussion after some presentations and one of the key points that was taken from the event was that we in the UK can learn a lot from the activities that are going on in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially with combatting the stigma and discrimination that surrounds HIV in the black communities in the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>T7TPuvvUzBH</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1F303F45-31C9-410B-8BC9-34E0A8F9F27B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Low levels of HIV test coverage in clinical settings in the U.K.: a systematic review of adherence to 2008 guidelines.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sexually transmitted infections</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a1a6c2063eb6274b0987224f693bc017"><gtr:id>a1a6c2063eb6274b0987224f693bc017</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elmahdi R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1368-4973</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_16313_013_051312</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BAA563E8-1428-4D96-937A-D6CA69979B90</gtr:id><gtr:title>The global effect of maternal education on complete childhood vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC infectious diseases</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/94e39eae0457de5ac729c5c136bc0a93"><gtr:id>94e39eae0457de5ac729c5c136bc0a93</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Forshaw J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2334</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7af0bbd39735.31643389</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3CD18911-3C6E-4958-A1C6-5375EA8ADF89</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sexual risk behaviours and sexual health outcomes among heterosexual black Caribbeans: comparing sexually transmitted infection clinic attendees and national probability survey respondents.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal of STD &amp; AIDS</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ddc2382b2096c9e8d20001d831de338e"><gtr:id>ddc2382b2096c9e8d20001d831de338e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gerver SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0956-4624</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>ZFt61Lpqehq</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6B4C12AA-A0D0-467B-8B88-901D830297A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adherence to antiretroviral therapy in adolescents living with HIV: systematic review and meta-analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AIDS (London, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/624bbc02186f52ed82f477482cc2f056"><gtr:id>624bbc02186f52ed82f477482cc2f056</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kim SH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0269-9370</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546478a3ea2226.50832678</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0802431</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>9A8BEDCC-D902-4C9A-8CCF-C974265EA3FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.4  Surveillance and distribution</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
