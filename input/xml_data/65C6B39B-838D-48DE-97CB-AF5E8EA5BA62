These courses will 1) explore the use of large datasets in the social sciences; 2) examine approaches to the evaluation of social problems and 3) offer opportunity for participants to learn about advanced analytical techniques in relation to geographical information about social issues, Course 4 will involve participants learning about ways to utilise and analyse different types of visual data.

One distinctive feature of these courses is that they will involve 'hands on' activity, drawing on established big data sets, for example, as well as researchers' own data.

They are cutting edge courses, designed to develop research capacity and possibilities for research engagement in a changing context for research</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As indicated, the direct beneficiaries of this training proposal will be graduate students and early career researchers in the social sciences and those working in other disciplines which have an interface with the social sciences. These will be drawn from within the Cambridge DTC, and more widely from the social sciences within the University (particularly from social scientists working within ESRC Research Centres) as well as from the national social science community as part of ESRC's Advanced Training Network. 

Our proposed suite of advanced skills will enhance the potential for impact, as those trained through these courses will be expected to have increased ability to generate and communicate impact. If social scientists can broaden their repertoire of skills it is expected that this will create new opportunities for research with Government and other collaborating partners, as well as facilitating more effective communication, dissemination and policy development.

In terms of broader impact, given that our aim is to achieve wide participation, we expect there to be eventual impact on academics within other Higher Education Institutions, and social scientists in the policy arena (e.g. government-based, private or third sector/voluntary sectors) as course participants take back and try out the new approaches and techniques which they have learned in their home disciplines and institutions, in collaborative ventures with government and non-government organisations, and subsequently in industry and other employment settings when participants complete their Ph.Ds and seek employment. We very much see this suite of courses as contributing to capacity building in terms of new advances in research methodology - with a subsequent trickle-down effect across disciplines and organisations. We think that there is particular need to train a new generation of social scientists in evaluation techniques as the public sector provision of services is opened up to new providers, for instance. To illustrate the issue, whereas the provision of community based interventions for offenders (programmes) has hitherto been through the state criminal justice system (the probation service), it is now being opened up to new private and third sector providers. These new providers will require input from social scientists to guide evaluation. Similarly, as the collection and format of data changes, and as new data sets come on stream, there is need for a new generation of social science researchers who can engage with big data and can deploy a range of approaches to the presentation and analysis of data.

Our proposal will directly address the challenges of changing social research contexts and evolving forms of media, equipping social scientists with a wide range of approaches. There will be direct applicability of this enhanced capacity; through engagement with collaborative activity within the DTC we will be able to ensure that benefits accruing from this training are translated into the external sphere. Dissemination in this way will be complemented by sharing through the DTC network our evaluation of this training and learning points identified.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19198</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Northumbria University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the University of Northumbria.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F45FD7C2-BA81-401B-8B5E-8DF1FAFBFDD0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca8159f338b8.68361764-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Co-delivery of two sessions of training.

In the context of interviews with 103 migrant women, in the prison and immigration holding estate, detained or arrested on charges that were potentially linked with entry to or exit from the UK or work under the control of others, evidence gathered indicated that 43 were victims of trafficking, of whom two were formally reassessed as children whilst in the adult estate. The findings therefore relate to the identification of victims of trafficking in custody, to the management of victims in the criminal justice system and in immigration procedures, and to the need to ensure the best interests of the child where the arrestee is a mother. 

A number of policy and practice recommendations were made as a result of the research, including exploring different ways of increasing awareness of the trafficking indicators by the police, Department of Work and Pensions, and relevant others, when making arrests for offences such as deception, fraud, and cannabis production, where the incidents of links between the offence and trafficking is highest. We also recommended the production of induction videos for all remand prisoners, with interpreted subtitles in key languages on how the court system functions. A similar recommendation was made in relation to immigration procedures. Another policy and practice suggestion includes the need for sufficient time and support to be given at the point of arrest for preparations to be made for the separation and to access a carer known to the child.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We continue to discuss the research findings with relevant others.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9AD865AB-7523-4B1D-9FA0-1123F78755F1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e18bd19353f9.45544426</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/people/academic_research/loraine_gelsthorpe/criminalreport29july12.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training development</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FAC34313-E4EF-4ACA-B524-A8B1D4F8D686</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The training contributed to the skills sets of social science researchers in Cambridge and from overseas, given that there were participants from other agencies and institutions in other countries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16842ad77e1.03502443</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The Advanced Training Grant supported the development of two entirely new training modules in (i) Impact Evaluation and (ii) Spatial and Spatial-Temporal Analysis, enabling advanced learning for graduate students and social science researchers.
