One difference between the two is that YAH maps are very much designed for the anticipated task that is likely to occur at the place where they are situated. For example, the map at a trailhead will typically not be simply a reproduction of an Ordinance Survey map of the local area but a representation that increases the salience of the trails and landmarks that may be more relevant to the walker. The YAH map is still likely to be 'Northed' but may be more sketch-like or 'low fidelity' in its design and certain liberties may have been taken with the map's scale. Indeed, even the choice of what area to cover on the YAH map is something that will have been considered by its designer based on the anticipated requirements of the map reader at the site of the map's location.It is not difficult to imagine scenarios in which a hiker arrives at a YAH map at a trailhead, and attempts to make a mental sketch of the map or even a physical sketch. Of course, the walker may or may not be carrying the relevant OS map (and one would certainly hope so if a serious walk was being considered) or have access to a separate GPS device or even a mobile maps application running on her personal GPS-enabled mobile phone. But the image on the YAH map will still be a useful one for the walker to carry away to assist her navigation.One way in which the hiker can 'walk away' with this YAH map is to 'capture' the YAH map by taking a photo of it with her camera phone and then refer to this image en route, the map image effectively remaining as a static artefact. Another approach, however, would be to utilise the context of the capture (i.e. the latitude and longitude coordinates of the location of the YAH map obtained from the mobile phone's built-in GPS) in order to transform the image into a georeferened image. This would effectively produce a mobile map but one based on the YAH map design and so perhaps more useful for the hiker's task at hand than the generic map that would appear if the hiker performed a download using Google or Nokia maps.The central aim of this research is to explore this new paradigm, to understand the way in which mobile phones can provide a useful and usable facility by supporting the capture, georeferencing and display of traditional YAH map signage and the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) issues associated with this interaction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83548</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of M?nster</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the geo-informatics group, University of M&amp;uuml;nster</gtr:description><gtr:id>E998D1A7-7B48-4D31-B6AE-2110FC0728B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One key outcome was the a runner-up award in Nokia's global Calling All Innovators competition pertaining to a developed mobile app supporting the capture and geo-referencing of YAP map signage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b7f84ab7e999.68439566-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Co-development of mobile apps/tools such as &amp;quot;Photomap&amp;quot; and evaluation activities associated with these tools.

A presentation of the project's findings has also been given to the director of WSi Ltd, a signage company based in north of England and responsible for the design and production of a range of You-are-here map based signage.

A user centered design approach was followed which involved a significant empirical user study (including the use of on-line surveys and one-to-one contextual interviews in order to understand how people currently encounter and use You-are-here maps), the capture of a wide corpus of You-are-here maps and iterative prototype development. Two novel prototypes applications were developed in the project. 

The first prototype supported the populating of the You-are-here map corpus by providing non-technical users with a tool to capture and describe You-are-maps found in the field and upload to the EXTRAMS You-are-here map corpus. The corpus produced currently contains over 450 examples of YAH map signage, this corpus was then analysed in order to produce a set of characteristics for categorizing YAH maps (e.g. the type of scale legend used, whether the map is Northed, etc.) and this range of different characteristics was used to inform the design of the second prototype application.

This second prototype application supported a range of interaction techniques (to match the characteristics of the You-are-here map being used) and interface designs (e.g. the use of graphical cues to support the framing of the You-are-here map being photographed using the smartphone camera) to support the various phases of the capture and geo-referencing process. 

Both prototypes were evaluated in both controlled lab studies and 'in-the-wild' deployments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The EXTRAMS project produced generalizable contributions in the area of Mobile HCI which can be taken forward by both academic and industry practitioners. For example, the user interface techniques developed for supporting the framing of a You-are-here map being photographed using the smartphone camera will generalize to support the capture of other entities or objects within the environment in order to support citizen science activities.

The project also proved the feasibility of geo-referencing approaches that enable users with smart phones to support utilise traditional You-are-maps in order to support navigation tasks using their mobile phones. The majority of You-are-maps identified in the EXTRAMS corpus are highly stylised compared to the equivalent digital maps representations such as Google maps. Consequently, the geo-referencing approaches developed and documented in the project can be utilized by the tourism, heritage and retail sectors in order to enhance the user experience.

Furthermore, the project produced and documented significant corpus and accompanying analysis which may be ulised by a variety of research disciplines (e.g. space syntax) and industry sectors (e.g. traditional and digital signage).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8570AFE7-E453-4681-9180-D24CA35CE31E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545d2e7a902f82.12021576</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The &amp;quot;Photomap&amp;quot; mobile app supported users in the capture (using the phones camera) and geo-referencing (using the phone's built in GPS) of You-Are-Here map signage.
