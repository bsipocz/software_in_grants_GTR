Specifically, one seeks to determine which properties are exceptional, in that they hold for a sparse set. In addition to its intrinsic beauty, Diophantine approximation has a wide variety of applications. For instance, numbers which possess certain ``exceptional Diophantine properties play an important role in various engineering and physical problems, for instance in KAM theory and celestial mechanics. Indeed, the study of Diophantine approximation can be traced back to the ancient Greeks who studied it precisely for its applicability. It turns out that showing that points on a surface satisfy these exceptional laws is much more difficult and has been one of the central themes in this area of research. In other words, one wants to show that a surface, or its higher dimensional analogue has the property that the set of points which have good approximation properties is sparse. This study of such problems is referred to as Diophantine approximation on manifolds and is one of Ghosh's key research areas. Ghosh uses an approach inspired by Kleinbock and Margulis which uses powerful tools from the theory of dynamical systems, in particular certain unipotent flows which are extremely well behaved. On the other hand, Ghosh and his co-author M.Einsiedler have also made basic contributions to the theory of unipotent flows. The proposed research has two core objectives. To make contributions to the study of metric Diophantine approximation on manifolds, particularly to the problem of inheritance of Diophantine properties by submanifolds of Euclidean space. It is expected that a part of this project will be undertaken in collaboration with S.Velani (York). S.Velani is a leading expert on Diophantine approximation. Moreover, Ghosh and Velani have different approaches to similar problems and one hopes that combining methods will provide a fresh perspective on difficlt problems.The second objective is to make contributions to the study of homogeneous dynamics over certain structures called local fields-particularly those with positive characteristic. This part of the project will be undertaken in collaboration with M.Einsiedler (Ohio State). This corresponds to the dynamical part of Ghosh's research and the aim of this project will be to gain a better, hopefully complete understanding of these systems which are conjectured to be extremely well behaved systems even though they appear very complicated. This is also related to the first objective because it is highly likely that toold developed in this part of the project will be applicable to number theoretic problems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>144093</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E045308/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>E6871D34-07A7-4D31-AA7B-0A8E436D4FBF</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/E045308/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>189657.36</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2008-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:end>2008-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>ABD86F0F-6A47-4E98-9F0A-F9D2B1FDEDC5</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/E045308/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>144093.68</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
