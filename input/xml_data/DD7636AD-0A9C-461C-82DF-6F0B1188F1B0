Antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria has historically arisen in parallel with the development of new antibiotics; this race posing a major health problem worldwide where bacteria seem to be winning [33]. A paradigmatic example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which can cause severe infections in the bloodstream and the lung and that, after developing resistance against penicillin, has become resistant also against a second antibiotic, methicillin. Development of resistance against antibiotic can occur due to antibiotic pressure, where non adequate prescription policies play a fundamental role. This is one of the reasons for DRB being a particular challenging problem in healthcare facilities, together with other reasons such as the presence of aged individuals with weaken immune systems. The problem of the presence of DRB in HCSs has taken the next step by their spread in the community (non-healthcare environments). This has led to the appearance of new strains which are able to cause severe infections in healthy individuals. Moreover, the infiltration of these new community-related strains in HCSs has become an additional challenge.

In order to avoid the emergence and spread of DRB in HCSs, different strategies are usually followed: appropriate antibiotic prescription policies, management of staffing levels, isolation of infected patients, compliance of hygiene procedures, etc. However, most of HCSs usually follow a combination of these procedures, and the individual efficacy of each of them is hard to measure. This quantification is important not only due to the scarcity of resources in these clinical environments, but also because some of these policies entail moral and ethical problems. Mathematical models have proven to be a robust tool for addressing the efficacy of these individual strategies, as well as for identifying the factors involved in the emergence and spread of DRB in HCSs. 

The aim of this fellowship is to contribute to the mathematical modelling in the area, in order to answer a number of open questions. Particular questions that will be addressed within this fellowship are: which is the importance of some factors, such as the contamination of the healthcare setting environment (for example, equipment), in the spread of resistant bacteria in healthcare settings? How does this spread occur in different healthcare settings (for example, in hospitals versus nursing homes)? What is the impact caused by the existing heterogeneities among individuals within the HCS (healthy individuals, such as HCWs, versus moderate or severe ill patients; adults versus children; patients under antibiotic treatment, ...)?. Additional questions to be addressed within this fellowship are related to the use of clinical data for refining the mathematical models, and the consideration of new mathematical models that can explain the process by which DRB arises within a particular individual.

The emergence and spread of DRB is a major problem worldwide. However, due to financial reasons (for example, some antibiotics newly developed are only effective for a few years, with the subsequent development of new DRB strains) the number of pharmaceutical companies working in new antibiotics development is scarce, and governmental financial incentives are usually required [24]. Moreover, it is worth noting that, in Europe, it has been estimated that infections with MDRB cause around 25000 deaths per year [25], with an estimated cost of 16 million additional bed-days (translating into 7 billion Euros in direct medical costs) [19]. Thus, it is necessary to combine the development of new antibiotics with control intervention measures to avoid the emergence and the spread of DRB among HCSs, which is at the same time crucial to implement intervention strategies based in quantitative knowledge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>See Case for Support document for abbreviations and references.

This fellowship focusses on the mathematical modelling of the emergence and spread of DRB in HCSs. Due to the small population sizes involved in HCSs, the stochastic approach is considered. Main aims of this research amount to: (i) to develop intra-host models for the emergence of DRB; (ii) to relate the quantitative information obtained from these models with new epidemiological models in the population level for the spread of these bacteria strains among individuals in HCSs. These new models will address at the same time a number of open questions in the area (e.g., competition between different strains, or consideration of HCSs different than hospitals); (iii) to develop new stochastic models and tools for analysing the efficacy of intervention measures for controlling the spread of DRB in HCSs; (iv) to adapt tools that I already developed [P7,P10], and develop new mathematical/statistical tools, to address the intrinsic heterogeneity among individuals in HCSs; and (v) to relate models with clinical data.

In order to attain the objectives listed above, I will make use of a wide range of techniques in which I have expertise. Among others, these techniques amount to: study of stochastic descriptors, analysis of first-passage times and absorption probabilities, use of auxiliary Markov chains, Laplace-Stieltjes transforms and probability generating functions, consideration of phase-type distributions, and algorithmic approaches within the matrix-analytic techniques [17]. On the other hand, particular skills development objectives within this fellowship are to widen my clinical knowledge in DRB, and to apply statistical techniques in order to relate the stochastic models developed within this fellowship with clinical data provided by clinical collaborators. To this end, different statistical techniques (the ABC algorithm, the Gibbs sampler or Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods) will be considered.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>See Case for Support for abbreviations.

I consider myself, in terms of my skills and career development, and due to the special characteristics of the Skills Development Fellowships, one of the main beneficiaries of this fellowship. This can be classified as short-term (within the project) impact of this research. I have a quantitative background, seeking to develop new expertise and skills for modelling the emergence and spread of DRB in HCSs. I will not only learn about the clinical aspects of these processes, but I will also develop skills in the application of statistical techniques to inform my mathematical models with clinical data. I will develop complementary skills (e.g. networking, student supervision...) not only by means of carrying out related activities during the fellowship, but also by attending a wide range of courses offered by the Staff and Departmental Development Unit (University of Leeds). Mid-term impact (1-5 years after the project) will be my establishment as an independent researcher in the area.
Beneficiaries of this research, in the mid- and long-term, are all across the healthcare sector. There is poor evidence base (see Letters of Support and Case for Support) for many of the prevention and control measures implemented in HCSs for avoiding the emergence and spread of DRB. My fellowship will help to understand their transmission routes, and to obtain quantitative knowledge regarding the efficacy of control measures usually applied. It has been identified, as an open question, the quantification of the efficacy of individual measures taken within intervention policies such as the Search &amp;amp; Destroy policy (see Case for Support), which is a combination of individual measures that leads to financial, legal and ethical problems. Thus, quantifying the efficacy of these interventions could lead to the design of intervention policies where only the most efficient individual measures are implemented, saving resources and avoiding these legal and ethical problems. New results in the area will directly help agents involved in healthcare policy making (e.g., collaborators and advisers in this proposal who have advisory roles in different national and international institutions for avoiding the emergence and spread of DRB in HCSs, such as Public Health England, the NHS or the UK Department of Health).
MDRB cause around 25000 deaths per year in Europe, with an estimated cost of 16 million additional bed-days (7 billion (euros) of direct medical costs) (see Case for Support and references therein). Thus, indirect beneficiaries in the long-term are patients, HCWs and institutions, since avoiding infections during (M)DRB outbreaks in HCSs directly depends on the implementation of quantitatively-based control measures, following recommendations by advisers mentioned above. Moreover, new tools developed within this fellowship will be useful in the area of mathematical epidemiology (e.g. analysis of heterogeneous environments), having an impact in the research carried out by other researchers, as well as by collaborators within this fellowship. Thus, the beneficiaries identified within their research projects will be also indirectly benefited, in the mid- and long-term, by the research carried out here.
 Finally, additional indirect beneficiaries, in the short-term, will be participants in activities in which I am and I will be involved. I have participated in the Higher Education Day (HED) in the Notre Dame Sixth College in Leeds (2014). During this day, I showed my research to students, to inspire them to consider researching, in the future, in the interface between mathematics and biology. My attendance to the HED in June 2015 is confirmed, and I have also participated in similar activities in different institutions abroad during the last years. Thus, I plan to maintain my participation in these activities in the future, as well as similar ones which may arise, in order to keep delivering this kind of impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282922</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>On the reinfection of individuals in stochastic epidemic models</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0902C2D-DD18-4DA3-BF2C-8EE0971DB056</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Main output is the manuscript

In order to do this, and as a training-oriented collaboration, M.

Lopez-Garcia implemented a number of techniques (usage of first-step arguments, auxiliary absorbing continuous-time Markov chains,..) in order to compute the probability that a given individual in the population gets reinfected by a propagating pathogen [1].

Lopez-Garcia -related to the development and analysis of mathematical/computational models for the spread of disease among individuals in a population- with the expertise by the research group of Prof. Catherine Noakes -related to the experimental measurement and the development of computational models for airflow dynamics- in order to analyse the role played by airflow and ventilation in the spread of airborne infections in hospital settings.

M. Lopez-Garcia proposed this collaboration by showing, in the draft in [1], how techniques previously developed by him with collaborators [2-4] -related to the analysis of stochastic epidemic processes- can be put together with techniques previously developed by Prof. Noakes [5], in order to assess the role played by airflow dynamics and ventilation in the spread dynamics of nosocomial infections (such as resistant bacteria) in hospital wards. 

When an outbreak related to a nosocomial pathogen begins in a hospital ward, the ventilation regime in this hospital ward (rooms configurations, existence of corridors, windows and airflows,...) needs to be considered as a control strategy that is in place even if this outbreak has not been detected by the healthcare workers in this ward. Thus, it is to be expected that some ventilation regimes might help more to contain the spread of the pathogen than others. The aim of this collaboration, which is currently taking place (with draft [1] available under request), is to identify ventilation regimes that should be avoided, and those ones that are to be recommended, as a control strategy to decrease the spread of nosocomial pathogens in the ward.

From a methodological perspective, we expect these new techniques to be widely applied in the future for incorporating realistic inter-event time distributions when analysing Biological systems by means of mathematical/computational models. From a Mathematical Epidemiology perspective, the case study analysed in this manuscript for the spread of a bacteria in a hospital ward will allow us to identify optimum screening policies for detecting the infection of healthcare workers during these outbreaks, while keeping below some threshold the total amount of resources needed for the implementation of these screening policies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2d1c7239431.99059072-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Prof. Mario Castro (Comillas Pontifical University, Madrid), is collaborating with M.

This assumption is a common assumption made when analysing these systems, due to nice mathematical/computational features of this Exponential distribution. However, it is well-known that this assumption might be unrealistic in some situations, so that new methodologies are needed in order to make our computational models closer to reality by considering more realistic inter-event distributions. 

In this collaboration, M. Lopez-Garcia is contributing with his expertise in the usage of a number of probabilistic tools when analysing these stochastic processes in Medicine and Biology. The objective of this collaborative work is to show how more realistic distributions can be used when analysing these systems. We illustrate this new methodology by considering a computational model for the spread of a nosocomial pathogen in a hospital ward, and when focusing on the risk of infection of a particular healthcare worker in this ward. When the bacterial outbreak is detected, it is typical that the hospital workers implement screening policies in order to detect new infectious cases during the outbreak. We show how these screening policies (e.g., screening healthcare workers every X days since the outbreak is detected) can be incorporated into our computational models by means of replacing the Exponentially distributed inter-event times by more general distributions, while still being able to analyse the resulting process.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>M?decins Sans Fronti?res (MSF)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Epicentre - M?decins Sans Fronti?res (MSF Epicentre)</gtr:department><gtr:description>On the reinfection of individuals in stochastic epidemic models</gtr:description><gtr:id>3F6FC36F-4A34-4652-8304-7A1EFC5BAC55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Main output is the manuscript

In order to do this, and as a training-oriented collaboration, M. Lopez-Garcia designed during this visit a number of simple mathematical epidemic models (SIS, SIRS, SIRI,..) that account for reinfection of individuals. For these models, M. Lopez-Garcia implemented a number of techniques (usage of first-step arguments, auxiliary absorbing continuous-time Markov chains,..) in order to compute the probability that a given individual in the population gets reinfected by a propagating pathogen [1].

A Gomez-Corral, M Lopez-Garcia (2017) Perturbation analysis in finite LD-QBD processes and applications to epidemic models,

When analysing a mathematical model for the spread dynamics of a pathogen among a population, such as patients and healthcare workers among a hospital ward, a typical difficulty that arises is to estimate the parameter values of this model (the infection rates between patients and healthcare workers, the average infectious period of each individual,...), and also to estimate how much each of these parameters affect the outputs of the model (e.g., how much the recovery period length of each individual affects the total number of infected patients at the end of the outbreak? When a bacterial outbreak arises in a hospital ward, how much the average length of stay of patients in this ward affects the disease spread dynamics?,...). This impact can be estimated by carrying out a perturbation analysis of the computational model. However, a typical difficulty that arises is that the number of parameters in these computational/mathematical models combinatorially increases with the number of individuals (i.e., patients and healthcare workers) in the hospital ward. 

In this manuscript, we develop a new analytical and computational methodology that allows for an efficient and comprehensive perturbation analysis of the epidemic model under study. We illustrate this methodology by applying it to a computational model for the spread of two bacterial strains (an antibiotic-susceptible, AS, and an antibiotic-resistant AR, strain) within a hospital ward. The perturbation analysis allows to obtain the following clinical insights: 

(i) Implementing control strategies against the AS strain can be counter-productive, since the AS strain competes with the AR strain for infecting patients; 
(ii) The rate at which patients are discharged as well as the infectiousness of the AS and AR bacterial strains are the most important factors affecting the dynamics of these infections; 
(iii) The usage of antibiotics which are effective against both strains of bacteria is specially effective for reducing the length of the outbreak. This control strategy also seems to play a significant role in reducing the peak of the outbreak; 
(iv) The usage of antibiotics which are only effective against the strain of AS bacteria can have a negative impact for controlling the AR bacterial strain outbreak. This is related to the fact that these antibiotics have no direct impact on the recovery of patients infected by AR bacterial strain, but at the same time it helps to remove from the system its direct competitor (i.e., the AS bacterial strain).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article at the national magazine Muy Interesante (&quot;Very Interesting&quot;), Spain</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5918FEE6-2BBF-4ED8-81BE-0CD3470566B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of receiving the &amp;quot;Vicent Caselles&amp;quot; research prize by the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society and the BBVA Foundation in Spain (see Awards &amp;amp; Recognition section), the research carried out by M Lopez-Garcia attracted a lot of attention.

These are a series of video games, developed in Actionscript2, where the player is &amp;quot;converted&amp;quot; into the director of a hospital ward, who has to make some policy-making decisions during the course of an outbreak by a nosocomial pathogen. 

In &amp;quot;Hospital Infections Scenario 1&amp;quot;, the player can choose how to allocate patients among the different available rooms in this hospital ward, this rooms configuration having an impact on the spread dynamics of the nosocomial pathogen. A histogram plotting the probabilities related to the total number of individuals suffering the infection during the outbreak helps to identify the best strategies for controlling the outbreak. Moreover, an interactive panel allows the player to learn more about these infection processes. 

In &amp;quot;Hospital Infections Scenario 2&amp;quot;, the player must now allocate two types of patients: patients suffering or not a chronic disease. It is explained to this player that suffering a chronic disease can mean that the immune system of this individual is weaker than usual, so that his/her susceptibility against the nosocomial pathogen might be higher. Thus, the decision about how to allocate these two types of patients among the available rooms needs now to take into account these individual heterogeneities, which will affect the spread dynamics of the nosocomial pathogen. Again, histograms and text explanations allow the player to look for the best strategy and to better understand these processes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>30ECFE0E-80E0-4E9E-817B-1C3CA53A9402</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main objectives of these video games are:

(ii) To create an interactive platform that can be used to publicise and show the research carried out within this fellowship to the general public; 
(iii) To show the usefulness of developing mathematical/computational models when analysing the spread of nosocomial infections in hospital settings; 
(iv) To encourage students in Schools and Colleges to carry out studies in the area of Mathematics applied to the Natural Sciences, Biology and Medicine, helping to reduce the problem of STEM skills shortage in the UK

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/ready-and-enabled/stem-skills-shortfall/ ;
 
(v) To help the general public to understand the main concepts of random processes and their applications in the area of Mathematical Epidemiology and Public Health. 

To this aim, M Lopez-Garcia has designed a specific web-site 

https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~lopezgarcia/Bacteria.html

where these video games are publicly and freely available. This web-site also contains information related to some of the research carried out by the MRC in this area, and some explanations about the basic concepts related to antibiotic resistance. 

Moreover, these video games will be used in a number of public engagement activities that will be carried out by M Lopez-Garcia during 2017, in order to maximise the chances of achieving objectives (i)-(v):

1. A talk during the Sixth Form Conference to be held at the University of Leeds on June 2017; 
2. A talk during a symposium to be held at the University of Alicante (Spain) on September 2017. 

For the same aim, these video games will also be presented in scientific meetings to show the usefulness of this type of software for training, educational and public engagement purposes: 

3. A talk at the Biology and Medicine through Mathematics (BAMM!) meeting, Virginia Commonwealth University, May 2017;
4. A talk at an international meeting to take place at the Institute of Indian Sciences, Bangalore, India, April 2017. 

Finally, more &amp;quot;Hospital Infections&amp;quot; video game scenarios will be developed during the course of this fellowship, improving as well the playability of the newly developed and the currently existing scenarios. The web-site
