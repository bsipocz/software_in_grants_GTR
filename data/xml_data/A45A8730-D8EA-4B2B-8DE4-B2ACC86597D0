Molecular imaging is widely used for the characterisation of materials, and there are numerous methods available for generating and liberating ions from a surface and hence generating a chemical concentration map including those using mass spectrometry (MS). Since 2004, there has been an explosion of new MS methods in which a sample is analysed under ambient conditions. This has enabled the high throughput analysis of samples that are not vacuum compatible and has significantly speeded up the sample handling, which is often the time-limiting factor of vacuum-based techniques. Quantification, chemical speciation and spatial resolution are three key drivers for a multitude of applications, and there is currently not a single technique that can provide all these attributes at the sub-micron scale.

Direct Analyte Probed Nano Extraction Mass Spectrometry (DAPNe-MS) is a method of selecting and removing a small quantity of material from a surface, using a capillary tip attached to a nanomanipulator. The extracted material is then introduced into a mass spectrometer via nanoelectrospray ionisation. The technique has achieved sensitivity at the attogram level and is particularly suited to picking up trace materials from surfaces. Unlike imaging mass spectrometry techniques, the process of sample removal and ionisation are decoupled and there is minimal fragmentation. This provides better selectivity and opportunities for superior quantification compared with other ambient MS methods. 

Due to its recent inception, no DAPNe facility exists in the UK. Surrey houses in its Ion Beam Centre (IBC) the only ambient pressure imaging MeV-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) system in the world which offers sub-micron molecular imaging (EP/I036516/1). SIMS, an Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) technique, is known for its excellent spatial resolution but a drawback is the fragmentation that occurs during the sputtering process. Currently available techniques at Surrey and NPL have imaging capability with high spatial resolution, can distinguish between molecular species and even provide molecular concentration maps. Techniques which provide trace element information at the ppb level in ambient conditions (Particle Induced X-ray Emission - PIXE, also an IBA technique) are also readily available. The missing component is trace molecular information, which DAPNe will provide. We will use current techniques to highlight specific regions which require a more detailed analysis with very high sensitivity using this new unique probe. Complementary use of IBA and DAPNe (IBA-DAPNe) is unique internationally and would provide unprecedented level of characterisation of samples at the sub-micron scale in full ambient conditions. 

The proposed IBA-DAPNe system will provide missing information for researchers from any discipline and research projects will be prioritised on the basis of scientific excellence. Access will be provided free of charge for the first two years. We see particular benefits for those working across 6 key EPSRC themes: Energy, Manufacturing for the Future, Healthcare Technologies, Global Uncertainties, ICT and Engineering.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal supports research in applications ranging from energy and electronics through to the aerospace and automotive industries. It also underpins developments in national security and healthcare technologies. The fields of energy and biotechnology are estimated to contribute nearly &amp;pound;30 billion per annum to the UK, while the national security industry is worth &amp;pound;30 billion. The manufacturing industry is worth 10% of UK output. Establishing a new DAPNe system at Surrey will enable academia and industry to work together on new technologies in the above-mentioned areas. 

In 2013 David Willets together with the department for Business Innovation and Skills laid down the 'Eight Great Technologies', which will propel the UK to future growth. Through the applications conceived in the case for support, IBA-DAPNe will contribute to the knowledge base of 5 of these areas: Satellites (PV materials), Advanced Materials (carbon fibre composites, adhesion), Synthetic biology (interaction of endogenous compounds with NC3Rs), Energy (fuel cells, batteries, smart fibres) and Regenerative Medicine (proteins in fibres).

It is envisaged that society will be beneficially impacted by research carried out on materials for energy, which are central to electric vehicles. Electric vehicles offer promise in terms of sustainability and lowering of the carbon footprint. The associated positive environmental impact will be of both economic and societal benefit. The societal impact associated with smart phone technology and proposed health benefits of wearable technologies for health, have all been enabled by research into materials for electronics. Advanced electronic materials provide faster and smaller computing and
communications systems are transforming how society lives and works. 

Materials for energy are central to the technologies responsible for electric vehicles, which will be at the heart of a future economy associated with sustainability and lowering the carbon footprint The associated positive environmental impact will be of both economic and societal benefit. Energy materials will also impact society by reducing energy bills at the domestic level through smart electricity storage in the home. Storage capacity of the national grid is far short of current demands. Research into materials for energy can address this, benefitting society and industry alike.

Materials for electronics have societal impact in terms of advantages associated with smart phone technology and proposed benefits of wearable technologies for heath. Advanced electronic materials provide faster, smaller and more portable systems in computing and communications, which are transforming how society lives and works.

As part of the 5 year National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Prime Minister announced an &amp;pound;178 billion investment over the next decade, including provision for knowledge transfer with universities. This highlights both the importance of security to society, and end-user/academic partnerships. Investment in security assures continued trade and foreign investment in the UK, which contributes to the economic wealth of society at large.

The skills and facilities will be made open for use by other academics and industrial researchers, helping to ensure that the UK stays at the forefront of Analytical Science, which maintains the health of all the other disciplines above. The associated facilities will be seen and recognised as a valuable resource. Public interaction is key to realising the full impact of the research proposed here; it will increase awareness of the challenges and progress in the applications of Ion Beam Analysis and Raman Spectroscopy as well as the wider materials field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>513369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C55F21FB-4E82-452D-86B5-351D5F93E418</gtr:id><gtr:title>Antiangiogenic Activity and Cytotoxicity of Triterpenoids and Homoisoflavonoids from Massonia pustulata and Massonia bifolia.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Planta medica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8247a796eafc3a07779c55138b6c906e"><gtr:id>8247a796eafc3a07779c55138b6c906e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schwikkard SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0943</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d6624bd8389.69957014</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P001440/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
