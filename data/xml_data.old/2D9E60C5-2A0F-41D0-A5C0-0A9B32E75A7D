our knowledge of them is still lacking in fundamental respects. We do not 
know whether neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are really distinct particles, or 
just different versions of the same underlying particle, which is possible 
since they do not carry any charge. In recent decades neutrino oscillation 
experiments have shed considerable light on the flavour structure of neutrinos, 
and in particular how neutrinos may turn from one flavour into another due to
their tiny mass differences. However, despite knowing rather precisely these 
mass differences, we still do not know what the absolute mass scale of the
neutrino is. One of the highest priorities in particle physics today is to 
elucidate some of these mysteries surrounding the neutrino. This may
give us further insight into such fundamental questions as the nature of
physics at the extremely high energies associated with Grand Unification,
and the source of the matter-antimatter asymmetry which we observe in the
universe today.

Beta decay is a familiar radioactive process whereby a parent nucleus
decays into a daughter nucleus with the emission of an electron and
an (unseen) anti-neutrino. In certain nuclei beta decay is forbidden but,
very rarely, two simultaneous beta decays may occur. The distinctive
signature of two electrons being emitted has been observed in several
isotopes. We are searching for a distinct form of double-beta decay
in which no neutrinos are emitted alongside the electrons, resulting in
the electrons carrying away the full energy of the associated nuclear
decay. This &amp;quot;neutrinoless&amp;quot; process can only occur if neutrinos and 
anti-neutrinos are the same fundamental particle. Moreover, by measuring 
the rate of such decays we can effectively measure the absolute mass of 
the neutrino.

In order to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay with greater
sensitivity then ever before, we have built what is essentially the 
largest Geiger counter in the world. This so-called &amp;quot;tracker&amp;quot; for the 
SuperNEMO experiment records ionisation left by the electrons from the 
double-beta decay and allows us to visualise the tracks that they leave
in the detector. UK groups have been building this tracking detector
for the last 3 years, based on extensive R&amp;amp;D that took place before that.

The next phase for SuperNEMO is to take the UK-built tracker to an
underground laboratory located under the Alps between France and Italy
in order to shield the experiment from cosmic rays. There, we will 
marry the tracker with the other components of the detector that 
are being assembled by colleagues in France, Russia, the Czech Republic and
the US. Extensive work will be required to carefully assemble the
first module of SuperNEMO, called the &amp;quot;Demonstrator Module&amp;quot;, such that
it works as expected and that no radioactive contamination is allowed to enter 
the detector. Even trace contamination, far below the level of radioactivity
in ordinary materials, could completely swamp the very rare processes that
we are searching for.

By the end of this project, the SuperNEMO Demonstrator Module will be
up and running and launching into an exciting physics program to try
to address some of the fundamental questions outlined above.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although our objectives are largely scientific in nature, our 
work will have wider impact, including:

- industry. The SuperNEMO project members maintain close
 links with a number of companies including but not limited to 
 Hamamatsu (Photomultiplier manufacturer, Japan), ETL 
 (Photomultiplier manufacturer, UK), ELJEN (scintillator 
 manufacturer, US) and ENVINET (scintillator manufacturer, Czech
 Republic). We will maintain these links, continuing to test 
 new products and provide feedback to manufacturers where 
 appropriate.

- security applications. Members of the UK SuperNEMO collaboration
 have used their experience to propose and develop two prototype 
 detectors that use cosmic rays to passively monitor volumes for
 the presence of suspicious materials. We will continue to work
 on potential applications of technologies related to the
 SuperNEMO project.

- society at large. We plan a media campaign to coincide with
 the start of SuperNEMO operations. SuperNEMO provides 
 visually striking images of double-beta decay due to the 
 full event reconstruction that it performs. We are also filming
 various construction activities, anticipating their
 use in future public presentations. We believe that raising 
 the media profile of SuperNEMO will complement other particle
 physics news stories in the media and help to maintain the
 interest of the public and in particular school students who
 may be thinking of studying physics at university.
