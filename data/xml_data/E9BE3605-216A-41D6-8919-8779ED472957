In particular Salmonella enteritidis in eggs has been identified as a major cause of outbreaks. It has been recommended that eggs used in raw or minimally processed foods should be &amp;quot;commercially treated&amp;quot;, usually meaning inactivation by heat treatment. The treatment severity has to be low, in order to minimise the damage to the functional properties of the egg. Whilst the enforcement of this recommendation has helped to reduce the number of cases of Salmonella infections, the kinetics of the recovery and possible growth of Salmonella after heat treatments has not yet been quantified satisfactorily. A well-established and verified mathematical model would be especially important in cases where the heat treatment fails or where the food is cross-contaminated. The predictions generated by the model could be integrated into microbiological risk assessments. The project output would also help to improve the general understanding of the recovery process of bacteria injured by heat treatments. The purpose of this project is to model the survival and re-growth of Salmonella enteritidis after mild heat treatments. A mathematical model will be developed based on experiments in broth. It will be adapted to egg products, while bearing in mind that the medium has a significant influence on the recovery of injured cells, for which not all factors are known. The modelling will take into account: the probability of growth in the recovery medium which will depend on the treatment and environmental conditions; both the effect of the severity of the heat treatment and the environmental conditions on the distribution of the single cell lag times; the effect of the environmental conditions on the growth rate.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Improved models for single cell analysis in food microbiology studies.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4633634F-B0A6-46FA-AC1A-CC3899410ACB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5448e036e7da31.95857534</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The purpose of the project was to investigate the effect of salt on the kinetics of growth of Salmonella in egg after a heat treatment (akin to pasteurization). A laboratory medium was used to establish the modelling principles. It was found that:

1/ The probability of growth decreases with added salt in the recovery medium.

2/ The recovery took longer if the salt was added after the heat treatment than before.

3/ A micro-array analysis of the recovery after stress indicated that even if the recovery is in a medium without salt, osmotic stress genes were up-regulated.

Our study in LAGSAL highlights the ambiguity of the concept of &amp;quot;quantification of injury&amp;quot;. Namely, combined treatment may cause more structural changes in the cell than one treatment alone, however if the subsequent growth environment is not optimal but contains elements of the inactivating environment, the cells could be more suitable to adapt and re-grow there.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Predictive food microbiology models should be developed and applied to specific food-organism scenarios, for which the findings could be used efficiently.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C01D7415-4F8B-434A-8489-C7D8B5C8626C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1138152127.28283577748c88c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A7E6FBA9-3936-40F2-92C6-CE03A579E4EE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Predictive modelling of Salmonella: From cell cycle measurements to e-models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food Research International</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/64e45e07a822cacc33277efadcd61146"><gtr:id>64e45e07a822cacc33277efadcd61146</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mu?oz-Cuevas M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff3ff3936eecc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00042594</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
