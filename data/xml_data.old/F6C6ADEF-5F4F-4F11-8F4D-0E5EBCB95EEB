The cell membrane is the main barrier that viruses need to overcome to penetrate cells and cause disease. As part of their entry strategy, viruses interact with specific receptor proteins at the cell surface in ways which are not well understood. These cell-surface receptors are typically embedded in the membrane of the cell, where they can move randomly (via Brownian diffusion) in the membrane plane. The physical properties of cell-surface receptors, such as their mobility and anchoring to the cellular cytoskeleton (a mesh of filaments beneath the cell membrane), are likely to importantly influence virus entry events. However, our knowledge of these receptor properties and their role in virus entry is currently very limited.

This project aims at detecting and characterising molecular attachments between virus receptors and the cellular cytoskeleton. These attachments can play a crucial role in virus entry by modifying receptor mobility, enabling the clustering of receptors on the cell surface and/or stabilising virus-receptor interactions. As a first step, we will measure receptor-cytoskeleton attachments to determine if they are present in the absence of viruses. This will allow us to understand the baseline properties of virus receptors and will set a basis upon which to investigate the role of these links during virus entry.

We will focus on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) as a model system. HIV particles first attach specifically to receptor molecules CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 on the surface of cells of the immune system. These receptors then redistribute and accumulate at the sites of virus attachment on the cell surface. Eventually, the virus penetrates the cell membrane and releases its genome into the cellular cytoplasm. Several recent studies have pointed towards links between the CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors for HIV and the cellular cytoskeleton. These links, together with dynamic rearrangements of the cytoskeleton upon HIV attachment, have been suggested as responsible for the receptor redistribution and clustering required for HIV entry. However, the proposed links have not been observed directly to date and the mechanisms for clustering remain unknown.

We will develop a new sensitive instrument (with nanometre, millisecond and sub-picoNewton resolution) that will allow us to measure these unknown interactions at the cell surface using optical tweezer technology combined with novel sequential data acquisition and real-time data analysis. This unique instrument will allow us to pull individual CD4 receptor molecules in the membrane of living cells to establish whether connections made by specific linker proteins exist between CD4 and the cytoskeleton. We will do this by comparing force measurements on cells displaying CD4 on their surface with and without the linker proteins. Our results will enable us to understand the role that receptor-cytoskeleton interactions play in virus entry, with this being the first time that putative CD4-cytoskeleton attachments are probed directly. 

Our results will form the basis of future investigations into HIV entry and into other virus-receptor systems that exhibit similar entry mechanisms. Our research will potentially open new avenues for anti-viral drug design, generating benefits to human health and positive societal and economic impact. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this research programme for measuring and characterising molecular interactions will be broadly applicable to various biomedical and biophysical problems that involve cell-surface receptors and are important to human health such as, for instance, cell growth in cancer and immune response to infections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our investigations of the molecular mechanisms of virus entry into living cells, with a focus on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), have a clear health and societal impact. Viral infections remain a serious threat to human health and economic wellbeing, with HIV infecting around two million people and killing a similar number every year. Our research results will also contribute to the understanding of other virus systems that exhibit similar receptor-mediated entry mechanisms. Over the long term, our results will inform the development of new antiviral drugs, generating additional economic benefit in the UK.

Apart from directly benefitting the research community (biologists and physicists) investigating the fundamental mechanisms of virus entry (and specifically HIV), our techniques have a much broader impact: force spectroscopy and cell-surface receptor investigations are applicable to various biophysical problems important to human health, such as, for instance, cell proliferation in cancer, neuronal activity, and pathogen recognition and immune cell activation. 

As part of our impact plan, we will actively pursue connections with life scientists interested in quantitative biology and biophysical approaches for the purpose of establishing new collaborations in the above-mentioned topics. We will continue to collaborate with the Optical Tweezer group in the Central Lasers Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory so that both their group and ours can benefit from plans for future force-sensing experiments relevant to receptor-mediated virus entry, as well as from sharing optical designs and software for experiments.

We will seek the broadest possible academic impact for our work by: presenting our results in international conferences and publishing in international journals; showcasing our research in our group's blog (https://illglab.wordpress.com/); widely sharing and publishing newly-developed protocols and calibrations for precision force sensing with axial optical tweezers; sharing new open source code on Github for controlled automation of experiments and data-analysis.

Over the course of this project, training will be provided to one PhD student and four Masters and undergraduate summer students in broad multidisciplinary research skills and communication skills. In the future, these skills will be transferred to various jobs and activities (in academia or in industry) generating economic benefit in the UK and/or internationally. 

The general public will additionally benefit from our research through our public engagement programme. This includes hosting one school student per year for a 1-week internship in our lab, organising lab tours open to the general public and actively participating in the public outreach activities organised by the Francis Crick Institute (I. Llorente-Garcia will be associated to the Francis Crick Institute via a sabbatical attachment in 2016-2017).

Industry will also potentially benefit from our research in the following ways, that we will actively explore via contacts with appropriate industrial partners: (i) from commercialising our fluorescence-force microscopy platform in collaboration with our group; and (ii) from the application of our techniques to the pharmaceutical industry, specifically for measurements of single molecule binding/unbinding rates relevant to drug delivery and design.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P020747/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02FE9751-1497-4DFD-B349-D4A9C96538E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
