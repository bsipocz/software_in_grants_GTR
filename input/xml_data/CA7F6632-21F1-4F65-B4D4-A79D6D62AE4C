This problem is compounded by an acute shortage of trained specialist manpower to provide mental healthcare to those who require it. The existing manpower can only provide care for one third of the mental health needs. Furthermore, 70% of this manpower is inequitably concentrated in urban areas while 70% of the Indian population lives in the villages. This mismatch is a great public health challenge and there is an urgent need to look at innovative ways to overcome this barrier to access. Affordable technology, which is easily accessible in India today, might provide the turning point in the field of mental healthcare delivery. In this project we plan to use videoconferencing technology to provide mental healthcare for patients attending primary care clinics. We plan to discover whether such an innovation is feasible and safe to deliver, acceptable to the various stakeholders and has a positive impact on the mental health of the people. Videoconferencing facilities will be established between District Hospital and Primary Health Centres, where most patients access health care. Patients with Depression, Alcohol use disorders and Severe mental illness will be identified by research workers, who will be offered consultations with a psychiatrist based in the District Hospital via videoconferencing. Medication and follow up services will be provided in the primary health centres. Before-after assessment will measure change in symptoms and disability level. Since the service is delivered in the community we expect better compliance rates. In-depth interviews will be conducted with all stakeholders including service delivery agents, patients and their families to determine the acceptability of tele-psychiatry. Demonstrating that delivering mental health care through tele-psychiatry is feasible and acceptable has significant policy implication. Tele-psychiatry can then play a transformational role in mental health delivery in low resource settings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The treatment gap for mental illness is as large as 75% in India. One of the reasons for that is the severe deficit of trained mental health professionals to deliver evidence based treatments. This proposed proof of concept study aims to increase access to mental healthcare through the innovative use of tele-psychiatry. We aim to offer remote consultation services using tele-psychiatry for those identified with depression, alcohol use disorders and severe mental illness in primary care attendees. The package of care will be developed through a formative phase using mixed methods; we plan to then test whether tele-psychiatry is feasible, acceptable and safe through an uncontrolled treatment cohort with a before-after design. Assessments at three months will evaluate key outcomes such as symptom burden, compliance rates and disability levels along with user and service provider experiences. If this test is positive, we will then plan an RCT (to follow from this project) to test this more rigorously.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Tele-psychiatry, if found to be feasible and effective, will have major policy implications for generalising and improving psychiatric care in India. 70 million people in India are in need of mental health (MH) care and, using the traditional models of healthcare delivery, the existing MH manpower can provide it to only 29% of this population. Scarcity of MH resources in primary care leads to people with MH problems not being identified, inadequately treated or being referred to distant tertiary care centers, the remoteness of which precludes sustained follow up care. The use of technological innovation as proposed in our research project will help mitigate this public health crisis. At the end of this project we will have evidence to know whether it is feasible to integrate TP into public health systems. If feasible, this model will allow large sections of population to access scarce MH resources thus having a multiplier effect. Our research thus has the potential to impact the lives of millions of people who are in need of MH care in India and also inform mental healthcare delivery systems in similar settings in other LMIC. Further, if this project provides preliminary evidence of both feasibility and effectiveness, this could support replication in other settings especially where there is limited mental health care. Tertiary care institutions could use this model to provide satellite mental health clinics to increase penetration and coverage of mental health services.
Besides psychological morbidity, people with mental illness also have high medical morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Providing access and care to timely and sustained mental healthcare within an environment of primary health system will directly impact the overall health as well as quality of life of those with MH problems. As a society this has significant social, health and economic benefits.
Government of India through its National Mental Health Program (NMHP) has been providing MH care to some districts in the country; although this programme started in 1980, the NHMP has so far been able to provide coverage to only 127 out of 626 districts across the country. Among others, one of the main reasons for the poor success of this program has been MH manpower shortage. Integrating TP into the NMHP would enhance the scale and reach of the program. Delivery of MH services through primary care is a goal envisaged in the National Mental Health Policy. TP may play a pivotal role in realising this goal.
At a local level the small state of Goa (current location of the study) would be an ideal case study to demonstrate the integration of TP into public health system, and we plan to recruit the State Government as our partner in implementing a TP programme following the next phase of the research: the definitive RCT.
We also plan to engage the national government in the definitive RCT which will follow from this present feasibility study. The outcome of our research project would thus have further impact by way of translational research; providing a promising option in a country with a looming MH crisis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91086</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N021886/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>AAFE74BF-2594-40A4-9487-23A469C7A3C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.6  Psychological and behavioural</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
