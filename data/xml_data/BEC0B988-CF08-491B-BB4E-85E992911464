The work brings together two LFS projects in Bristol - the Edible Landscapes Movement (ELM) and the Matthew Tree Enterprise (TMTE). Through a series of co-produced arts and cultural interventions focused on producing, buying, cooking and eating food, our project seeks to enable dialogue and strengthen connections between concepts such as sustainability, resilience and wellbeing and people's daily lives and experiences.

Food is a critical resource commonly understood by myriad connections related to social and environmental systems. Climate change and increasing weather volatility, failed harvests, concerns around peak oil and the use of crops and farmland for biofuels are among a range of challenges contributing to disruptions in food supplies and dramatic swings in commodity prices. These trends not only demonstrate the inter-connected nature of food and climate change strategies, but also present a new set of challenges for global food security. For example, while current UK policy seeks to address food security primarily through supply-side strategies (e.g., increase production), a recent report by the Food Climate Research Network argued that healthier diets would go further than purely production initiatives towards addressing both environmental and hunger issues.
As such, research is needed to explore whether and how alternatives to traditional production models might engender changes in consumption practices and enable sustainable futures. Towards this objective, Foodscapes brings together academics, artists, community partners and community members from two disadvantaged areas of Bristol to consider new solutions to food security and sustainable communities. We believe that by focusing on consumption and by introducing enjoyment, fun, creativity and performance into LFS programmes we can bring about significant gains in health and wellbeing amongst participant communities, forge new pathways for civic dialogue, and challenge assumptions around sustainable practices. 

Our action research model will encourage participants to reflect on the production and consumption of the food they are growing (and eating) by affording meaningful opportunities to co-design and 'co-research' the Foodscapes initiative. This process of arts production - working alongside researchers and artists - will enable dialogue, interaction and social transformation by examining and revealing participant experiences in the project. In this way, we seek to draw out the value and meaning associated with concepts of sustainability, resilience and wellbeing within a context of precariousness and uncertainty. 

Our team is made up of academics from civic engagement and planning (Buser), cultural geography (Roe), sociology (Dinnie), and the arts (Hall). We have developed this proposal collaboratively with two community partners - Knowle West Media Centre and The Matthew Tree Project. Both partners are engaged in local food initiatives targeting disadvantaged communities in Bristol (ELM and TMTE respectively) and both are looking to draw out the potential for more sustainable communities through minute transformations in the mundane practices of shopping, cooking and eating.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal has been developed in concert with community partners and seeks to generate new knowledge within the realms of LFS and collaborative arts. We imagine that the work will benefit to a wide-range of end users and stakeholders. The primary non-academic beneficiaries include community groups and civil society organisations, the participants engaged in the ELM and TMPT local food initiatives, and public sector groups including politicians and policy makers. We also see this project as a framework for incorporating collaborative arts engagements directly into narratives of sustainability and innovative ways of responding to the challenges of climate change.

Civil society and Community partners: the project involves two community partners: Knowle West Media Centre (KWMC) a community-based media and arts organisation that coordinates the Edible Landscapes Movement (ELM) and The Matthew Tree Project (TMTP) a food bank charity that offers free food aid and support for individuals and families in emergency need. Through participation in this project, these organisations will be able to widen their work with constituent communities (both include significant populations of economically disadvantaged and socially excluded individuals) and improve the potential for success of their local food initiatives. We have already made an impact by bringing these two groups together (they are now sharing information and knowledge). There will also be interest and relevance to national groups engaged in local food issues (e.g., Making Local Food Work, the Soil Association), landscape (e.g., CPRE), as well as those seeking to study and address issues of social exclusion (e.g., TSRC) and support the third sector (e.g, Assoc. of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations). 
 
Project participants: We expect that the Foodscapes project will lead to direct benefits of health and wellbeing for those community members participating in the initiative. The groups and individuals we are seeking to engage are located in two of the most economically disadvantaged areas of Bristol. Knolwe West, in South Bristol has a population of around 15,000 and while there is a strong sense of community, the area has high levels of deprivation, with some parts of it being in the poorest 1% nationally (Knowle West Regeneration Strategy 2010). The Matthew Tree Project is located in St. Jude's, a housing estate area just off the city centre shopping district. Matthew Tree provides healthy food and diet to local residents and individuals across the city suffering from food insecurity. Many of the organisation's clients do not regularly eat three meals a day and are typically not eating healthy diets. Beyond improvements in health and physical wellbeing, our work will support opportunities to participate in a community project, to develop new skills related to growing and cooking food, as well as modes of expression through the arts. Moreover, through sharing between the ELM and TMTP projects, participants will benefit from a range of tacit knowledge about landscape, agriculture, and cooking already in existence in their communities and made available through the collaborative work. 

For the public sector, the project will inform policy-makers and politicians of the value of alternative food systems and the role of arts and performance in translating these policies into daily practice. This work will be of interest to politicians in Bristol as well as national policy makers and civil servants (e.g., DEFRA) where food security issues are being discussed. We expect that Foodscapes will be of interest to these groups and inform policy-making around the role of LFS, ways of shifting relations with food and diet, the role and potential of arts to support localised community engagement on issues of global significance, and about exploring sustainable lifestyles through engagement with economically disadvantaged and socially-excluded individual</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31446</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This product is an hand crafted 'book' by the artist (Paul Hurley).

We also had an off-site exhibition which was attended by over 80 people over the course of two days. At the exhibition, we recreated 'foodscapes' including practical work on bread baking and planting, discussions on food poverty as well as art and the use of art/creativity within food contexts.

After this workshop, we have built some new connections in Cardiff with artists interested in food. This is an ongoing relationship and we will see where it leads - we are hoping for future projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54609556c300b3.65865423</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://foodscapesbristol.wordpress.com/ahrc-cc-festival-2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Foodscapes Exhibition (Bristol)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF136353-0926-43E5-B041-15CEBD5B34FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Foodscapes centred on a 10-day interactive and performative exhibition in Bristol's city centre. The exhibition was designed to allow for an open-ended interaction with the artist, works of art, and various food-related materials and practices through both 'doing' and witnessing. Led by artist-in-residence Paul Hurley, we baked bread with festival-goers, food aid clients, passers-by, friends and family for 10 straight days. All told, over 900 visitors came into our space during Big Green Week and we baked with over 60 people. Many of these participants went home with information about food and food insecurity as well as new cooking and baking skills.

We purposefully avoided didactic methods of exchange and relied on the juxtaposition of various food practices and materials to create non-linear experiences to solicit conversation and draw out meaning. The juxtaposition of food materials and practices helped to bring people together from different backgrounds and disrupted taken-for-granted assumptions about consumption, food security, and boundaries between art and the everyday. Through these activities and experiences knowledge was co-produced by a dynamic and productive blurring of the relations between artist-researcher-participant-material.

The impacts from this event related mostly to those who attended the exhibition. We can account for some of these through maintained networks and relationships with community partners. For example, many participants commented on the impact of Foodscapes on their eating and food preparation habits. One woman who attended the Foodscapes exhibition and had used the foodstore in the summer of 2013, reported that as a consequence of participating in the project's bread baking activities she was now regularly baking bread for her family and neighbours who sourced their bread through her. The Matthew Tree Project indicated to us that through learning bread baking skills she now had found her place in the community and this skill could also be used for employment, or just to feed her family and support her local community with fresh bread to eat.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5433a9a3e99c63.15153301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://foodscapesbristol.wordpress.com/big-green-week/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Connected Communities Festival 2016: Community futures and Utopia</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9A2D5D98-082B-4756-A00F-570826583300</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e16c5a44c656.46308889</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Faculty Enterprise Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Southampton</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>How do food and nutrition services provided by The Matthew Tree Project influence diets?</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>AAD42E14-4971-4187-8DC2-9F141B633524</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546091f6e59b77.71143428</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>To date (2016) we know our project has produced benefits amongst project participants as well as stakeholder organisations. 

During follow-up discussions, many participants commented on the impact of Foodscapes on their eating and food preparation habits. One woman who attended the Foodscapes exhibition and had used the foodstore in the summer of 2013, reported that as a consequence of participating in the project's bread baking activities she was now regularly baking bread for her family and neighbours who sourced their bread through her. TMTP indicated to us that through learning bread baking skills she now had found her place in the community and this skill could also be used for employment, or just to feed her family and support her local community with fresh bread to eat. 

In addition, both TMTP and ELM stressed that Foodscapes changed the way they work and has helped make their activities more effective. For example, Sue Baic, a nutritionist and dietician working with TMTP found that by working with Foodscapes, she was able to recognise a broader role for food beyond nutrition. This included a better understanding of the social power of cooking together. As Sue notes 'I was both surprised and delighted at how many of the clients really engaged with the process of hands-on bread makingSome clients still talk about it a year on and we have incorporated more of these sort of recipes into discussions, practice and planning of our Cook Smart course. We might not have done this without our engagement with Foodscapes' 

At ELM, Mil Lusk reported that Foodscapes has had significant impact on their way of thinking and their approach to their work. ELM has always focussed on growing food and have encountered barriers when trying to distribute this food. After working with Foodscapes, they have realised the power of making and eating together and are now harvesting and making things collectively, with the local community. For example, this summer they have harvested strawberries and then held a strawberry jam-making workshop, which local people and volunteers attended with empty jam jars and took home jars of jam that they had made themselves. 

We are proud of these impacts and continue working with these organisations in a variety of ways. The project has helped build strong relationships between various partners including academics and non-academics as well as between partner organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6F577504-949D-401A-8DA7-825E08D554EA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>542d46d178ae79.06242125</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>FOODSCAPES was an AHRC Connected Communities project (2013) that explored the use of art as a way of opening up discussion about food. Foodscapes centred on a 10-day interactive and performative exhibition - visited by over 900 people - in Bristol's city centre. We purposefully avoided didactic methods of exchange and relied on the juxtaposition of various food practices and materials to create non-linear experiences. Key outcomes include: 

Enacting ecological citizenship: participants were invited to respond as ecological citizens. There was nothing to buy, nor information about 'improved' ethical supply chains, the emphasis wasn't on giving attention to local, fair trade, organic or animal welfare-friendly products, nor was advice available about 'how to food shop': if we had done this, we would have been enacting the ethical consumer. Instead we encouraged people to attend to different lived experiences with food preparation and eating. 

Material and performative engagement: The exhibition brought together experiences, materiality and aesthetics of our diverse project partners into a performative and multisensory space. This offered visitors a direct bodily engagement - kneading bread, smell of tomato plants, weight of the foodbank shopping basket - with some of the research material we were working with. As bread baking was central to our exhibition, we found that it was the slowness of the process which helped to forge dialogue, communication and exchange. 

Exhibition space as temporary autonomous zone: The event facilitated experiences that challenged assumptions about the daily practice of (food) consumption. This underlined our efforts to engage visitors as ecological citizens. It also contested consumptive attitudes towards the art experience - visitors were often not sure whether the exhibition or its components were 'art', and so with more actively and directly than they would have in a conventional gallery setting. 

Foodscapes aimed for meaningful involvement from partners and participants. We highlight three broad lessons related to our engagement experiences:

Embedding evaluation in design and delivery: Evaluation was embedded into the project so that the research questions were foundational to creative exchanges, rather than being separate, or bolted onto the creative experience. This approach helped us not only to understand our effectiveness, but also to assess how best to engage people on the research themes of food, food poverty and sustainable communities. 

Ethnographic field work: Carrying out ethnographic research was extremely valuable. Taking active roles with partner organisations allowed us to share in the experiences of being a volunteer and to be affected by the lives of those who access emergency food aid. 

Multiple forms of engagement and outputs: We found that it was valuable to engage participants in practices and outputs that served multiple and diverse interests. For example, photovoice was an effective means of bringing individuals into the art-making process and as a more traditional visual methodological research tool for apprehending diverse food practices within the larger TMTP community. We also used bread baking to build skills, trade knowledge about food, form friendships and share experiences. We know that many participants still call on the skills and friendships formed during Foodscapes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The primary non-academic beneficiaries include community groups and civil society organisations, the participants engaged the project, and public sector groups including politicians and policy makers. 

Civil society and community partners: the project involves three key community partners - Edible Landscapes Movement (local growers), Knowle West Media Centre (KWMC) a community-based media and arts organisation, and The Matthew Tree Project (TMTP) a food bank charity that offers food aid and support for those in emergency need. Through participation in this project, we expect these organisations to change particular working practices.

Project participants: We expect that the Foodscapes project will support direct health and wellbeing benefits for those community members participating in the initiative. The groups and individuals we are seeking to engage are located in Knowle West and St. Judes, two of the most economically disadvantaged areas of Bristol.

For the public sector, the project will inform policy-makers and politicians of the value of alternative food systems and the role of arts and performance in translating these policies into daily practice. This work will be of interest to politicians in Bristol and elsewhere concerned for the health and welfare of their citizens.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F60B407F-495B-4F80-BAE2-674F178018E0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>542d455b21a836.09569734</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://foodscapesbristol.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>54D56880-1598-47BD-A7BE-0BBADEE37D19</gtr:id><gtr:title>Foodscapes (Connected Communities)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5ccd60cfc80385714f4ccf9ba9f41800"><gtr:id>5ccd60cfc80385714f4ccf9ba9f41800</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buser, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433a5f6105d63.06479709</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>74840C7F-4A7E-4296-B0E0-8B0740AFF8FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Becoming ecological citizens: connecting people through performance art, food matter and practices</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>cultural geographies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9663f9fa6a7e6e0fe3b0e1bada2e9325"><gtr:id>9663f9fa6a7e6e0fe3b0e1bada2e9325</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Roe E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546092a041cf99.56974083</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K00400X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
