EA realises that measurement and data analysis techniques are now available to quantify emissions from certain types of industrial processes such as those emitted from point sources (stacks, chimneys, etc.) which help in better regulating and controlling them. However, it is also recognized that other types of emissions, referred to as fugitive emissions, are yet to be as well understood. Speranza (1) identified example fugitive emissions as those originating from a large number of very small, diverse locations around a building, a piece of equipment, a dusty road, or a storage pile. Recent DEFRA (2) report highlights the high uncertainty in the estimates of fugitive emissions of particulate matter, for instance, citing both measurement difficulties and their high dependence on topographical and meteorological conditions which are themselves highly variable in space and time. This work is intended to contribute towards reducing the uncertainties associated with the quantification, attribution, and management of fugitive releases from industrial sites.

This project is divided into three main stages. The first stage is to review existing literature on industrial emissions, fugitive emissions, and existing measurement and evaluation methods previously applied to fugitive emissions. The second stage is dedicated to analysing existing data and developing an appropriate framework to applying the conditional statistical analysis method to air quality data surrounding industrial sites. In applying the conditional analysis method, it is also essential to study the level of uncertainty of the assumptions and outputs associated with each step. Therefore, the third stage of this project involves investigating how conditional analysis and uncertainty analysis can be integrated to reduce the uncertainty in the final quantification of fugitive emission source. The combination of the second and third stages could also provide a basis for routinely optimising the outputs of conditional analysis and investigating the impact of more subjective model input parameters.

My MSc thesis project involved analysing and modelling environmental time series data using a classification and regression trees technique. This has allowed me to review environmental modelling techniques and understand the complex underlying processes linking emissions at the source to air quality level measured at the receptor and to understand how challenging it can be to account for the different meteorological and background variables involved in the atmospheric dispersion process. In the last 3 years, I have developed working experience of 'R statistical and computing' software and have used it to analyse and model environmental data. I am also currently using it to develop software to analyse and model time-series traffic and emissions data. Throughout my PhD as well, I have been interested in studying how uncertainty in the model inputs and model parameters has an influence on models outputs using for instance randomisation and sensitivity analysis methods. Combining EA/LEC researchers' experience of industrial processing/regulations and environmental analysis techniques with my existing knowledge in environmental data analysis, uncertainty analysis, and 'R' programming can help develop my knowledge in the field and accomplish the main stages of this project. In addition, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to engage more fully in the 'data analysis to decision making' process, something I think this project, with its strong focus on data analysis to support EA fugitive emissions management activities, could provide.

The research is focused on one of NERC's Innovation Priority Areas: Environmental Data. In particular, existing ambient air quality data collected by the 'Environment Agency Ambient Air Quality Monitoring' team has been used in order to better quantify and regulate emissions from the 'Environment Agency' regulated sites. The main objectives of the study is to (1) apply conditional analysis techniques to ambient air quality data in order to understand the different stages influencing emission source strength, particularly from that of poultry farms, and (2) to estimate 'real-world' emission factors of two air pollutants: Ammonia which is a harmful air pollutant to both the biodiversity and ecosystem and Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5) which is a harmful air pollutant to human health yet it is still understudied in terms of its emission intensity from poultry farms.
Currently collected ambient air quality data are mainly used for air quality compliance purposes. This research have used existing data from different campaigns and multiple sites in order to develop new methods for analysing ambient air quality data for regulatory purposes, generate new knowledge on how data can better be used to inform policies, and recommend on how existing campaigns can be designed to maximise their use in the field.
Two main methods for analysing ambient air quality data monitored near agricultural sites, particularly poultry farms have been developed and used: conditional analysis and inverse dispersion modelling techniques. The first, which includes partitioning and clustering techniques, has been used to identify 'real-world' background levels and to bin data to subsets with different emission strengths. Inverse dispersion is subsequently used to estimate new emission factors and compare them with currently used emission factors developed based on conventional methods. These emission factors are often used in the development of emission inventories of the air pollutants. Improving emission factors from Ammonia and particulates (in terms of their values and aggregation level or resolution) is thus essential for improving emission inventories needed at both the national and international levels.
Since this research makes use of ambient air quality collected mainly for compliance purposes rather than 'Emission Factor' estimation, the research thus provides evidence and identifies ways to improve the ambient air quality monitoring campaigns (for e.g. in terms of location, position, data and metadata collected, etc) in order to maximise their use for key purposes in research development and policy making.
Alternatively, the developed methods have been applied only to data from the agricultural sector; new research which directly follows is how these methods can be applied to data collected from other high-emitting sectors which need to be better and more efficiently regulated.
This 3 months internship has allowed for collaboration between three different parties: the University of Leeds' Institute for Transport Studies, the Environment Agency, and the University of Lancaster's Lancaster Environment Centre. The internship is now in its final stages during which a report would be produced for dissemination at the Environment Agency. Also, it is envisaged, that a journal paper would be written to highlight key methods, findings, limitations, and further work conducted in this research.
Throughout this research time period, a one week training course on 'Atmospheric Sciences' offered by NCAS has been taken to better understand the atmospheric processes and the mathematics involved in one of the key methods used in this research: dispersion modelling. Also, a one day training course on 'Clustering Analysis' method held by the 'Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN)' has largely helped improving the conditional analysis techniques used in the research. Both of which have involved learning skills to be used not only in this particular research but also generally in data mining as well as atmospheric science research in general.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Estimated 'real-world' emission factors at a higher resolution which consider the entire cycle of the emission process can be used to improve emission inventories from poultry farms and consequently from the Agricultural sector developed at both the national and European levels. The developed methods for analysing ambient air quality data can be used by researchers and regulatory bodies across different fields and applied to different types of agricultural processes and even to different high-emitting sectors.
Additionally, the assumptions being made in the inverse dispersion modelling technique can be taken forward and studied in more details to understand their influences on the derived emission factors. For instance, existing sensitivity analysis methods can be used in order to identify key factors (assumptions) influencing the output of the dispersion modelling and, particularly, the outputs generated in this research: emission factors. A lot of research is being conducted to not only model under certain assumptions but also to better understand the influences of the assumption being made on the research outcome.
Also, the limitations of current study in terms of data and metadata availability can be minimised in future studies. The final recommendation on how to best collect and analyse ambient air quality data can help future monitoring campaigns to be better designed and for cost-benefits to be maximised in terms of answering key policy and research questions related to the use of environmental data.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>08A0EB14-6DA9-413E-A563-2CD83C5F7D3E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d81d938b8f44.42369549</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N012704/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E4C03353-6311-43F9-9204-CFC2536D2017</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>45</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atmospheric phys. &amp; chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62E0966C-A067-4075-B244-33F1F4DD4B1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atmospheric Kinetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B01D3878-E7BD-4830-9503-2F54544E809E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Boundary Layer Meteorology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>085E9E17-60A5-4B2D-B9C5-F950A45872C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law and economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE661B5A-7390-4AD2-BCF2-D611CB668BD1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tropospheric Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
