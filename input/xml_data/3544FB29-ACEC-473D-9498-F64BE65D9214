This role has resulted in the recent explosive growth in fields such as Mathematical and Systems Biology. This proposal is focused on continuing an existing programme of week-long MMSGs and shorter follow-up meetings designed to foster and stimulate new collaborations between the mathematical and biomedical sciences. The MMSGs allow mathematicians, statisticians, biomedical scientists and clinicians to come together under `one-roof' for a period of five days, and to participate in the application of mathematical modelling techniques to problems presented by the biomedical scientists. The workshops are focused, collaborative meetings where the mathematicians work side-by-side with the biomedical scientists to tackle their problem. The new ideas that are generated can help to direct future experimental work and developing new informative mathematical models and techniques. Shorter one day follow-up meetings (three per workshop) allow collaborations developed at the workshops to develop further. MMSGs have a nine year track record of facilitating exciting interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians, biomedical scientists and clinicians which have led to journal publications and future research being funded through MSc and PhD studentships, fellowships and larger grant applications. The programme provides an exciting opportunity for interdisciplinary research and an excellent training environment for students and early stage career researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34328</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>One of the main impacts of these collaborative workshops between mathematicians and other academic disciplines and industry is the adoption of mathematical modelling as a key theme by the National Centre for the Refinement, Reduction and Replacement of Animals in experimental testing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9EF2F5BD-C651-479D-B074-13666C11F966</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cce0fbe32e57.64938095</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project involved four Mathematics in Medicine Study Group workshops held between the years 2009-2012 at Imperial, Strathclyde, Reading and Keele. These workshops involved the presentations, investigation and reports of nearly 20 problems in the areas of medicine and biology, delivered by non-mathematician academic and industry representatives. 

Further details on all problems, including reports, can be found at the website http://www.maths-in-medicine.org. 

Additional follow-up meetings stemmed from the research during the workshops and were organised in the following research areas: 

- NC3Rs Study Group
- Drug delivery - Colon-specific sustained release by hydrodynamic sorting
- Nanoparticles
- Signalling pathways
- ASM Growth in Asthma
- Virus Budding
- HPPD Initiation
- Mathematical modelling of the normal swallow
- Placental Growth
- Wound Healing
- Neurons
- Cardiac Arrhythmias
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Foot and Mouth Disease

These meetings have led to numerous collaborations and will lead to publications and additional funding. In particular a close link to the National Centre for the Refinement, Reduction and Replacement of Animals in experimental testing was formed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research and collaborations stemming from this grant is being taken forward by a large number of the original participants, through newly funded projects and links to non-mathematical academic groups and industry/health sector researchers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>288C7482-14AD-4EF2-AF8C-D06E5418FE24</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cce040e06298.62414197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.maths-in-medicine.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H00078X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
