This project investigates what factors determine risk-taking behaviour when making monetary choices. In particular, it focuses on how the need to exercise control over one's motor actions can influence risk-taking when making monetary decisions. Recently, the researchers have found that being prepared to cancel a motor response reduces risk-taking in a gambling task (Verbruggen, Adams, Chambers, in press).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Furthermore, they have demonstrated that learning to stop actions reduces gambling even when the tasks are performed up to two hours apart. These findings suggest that action control and high-level decision-making are intimately related. This offers exciting prospects for the development of interventions in eg gambling, substance abuse, and overeating.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a series of studies, different aspects of control will be examined to increase our understanding of the conditions in which low-level control of action transfers to the control of higher-order decisions. This could lead to the development of new behavioural training programs. More generally, this work has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of self-control and the ways in which deficits in control can lead to impulsive behaviour, poor restraint over urges, and increased risk-taking.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project is basic research on executive control mechanisms that regulate motor responses &amp;amp; decision-making when presented with risky choice options in healthy participants. We believe this work could have important theoretical &amp;amp; methodological implications for behavioural &amp;amp; neurological research that focuses on motor control, goal-directed behaviour, &amp;amp; decision-making (see Academic Beneficiaries). 

We expect that our work will also have important medium &amp;amp; long-term implications for clinical psychology &amp;amp; psychiatry, and more generally, for facilitating behaviour change in the wider population (e.g. with respect to overeating). Impulse-control disorders (e.g. ADHD, substance abuse, &amp;amp; pathological gambling) and behaviour control issues such as over-consumption of food &amp;amp; alcohol have been linked to executive control, and to response inhibition in particular. The economical &amp;amp; social costs associated with problems in controlling impulses &amp;amp; urges are huge. To give only a few examples:

- The economic &amp;amp; social costs of Class A drug use in England &amp;amp; Wales are estimated at around &amp;pound;15.4 billion in 03/04 [a].
- Most western nations with developed gambling industries report rates of problem gambling between 0.2 &amp;amp; 3.5% [b]. 
- In 2008, almost a quarter of adults in England were obese, and in 2004, almost 7% of all deaths in England were were attributable to obesity [c].
- The estimated cost of alcohol harm to the NHS in England is &amp;pound;2.7 billion in 06/07 [d].

These examples indicate that a good understanding of the psychological mechanisms of controlling impulses &amp;amp; urges is essential. We anticipate that the implications of our work for mental health &amp;amp; well being will be twofold. First, we expect that the proposed project will further identify the cognitive mechanisms underlying risk-taking behaviour &amp;amp; clarify how people control their urges, impulses, &amp;amp; behaviour. This will lead to a better understanding of the aetiology of impulse-control disorders such as pathologil gambling, and of why people might experience problems with controlling e.g. their eating behaviour. Second, the proposed research could also contribute to the development of new &amp;amp; better behavioural treatments &amp;amp; training programs. Several lines of evidence suggest that executive-control processes might play an important role in the treatment of impulse-control disorders [e]. Some treatments already focus on learning how to stop and reverse habitual addictive behaviour; however, the underlying cognitive mechanisms of such treatments are unclear [f]. Our work can shed light on these mechanisms. Furthermore, our pilot work has shown that training individuals in simple motor inhibition can reduce risk-taking in subsequent gambling tasks by teaching them to be generally cautious. This suggests that inhibition &amp;amp; executive control can be trained, which opens promising new avenues for treatment. Other studies also showed that a consistent pairing of specific alcohol-pictures to stopping in a response-inhibition task reduced the subsequent weekly alcohol intake of students; similar findings were obtained with food-related pictures and subsequent food intake [g,h]. These studies were directly inspired by our earlier work on stimulus-stop associations [i], demonstrating the impact of our previous basic research in an applied domain. The requested studentship project will further explore how such stimulus-specific learning of inhibition can influence decision-making and control over urges &amp;amp; impulses. 

Finally, because the proposed work is on higher-level monetary decision-making &amp;amp; maximising gains, it could also be of interest to behavioural economists &amp;amp; regulators who try to moderate excessively risky decision-making in the financial sector, and more generally, to scientists &amp;amp; non-scientists (e.g. insurance companies) who want to understand how risk-taking behaviour can increase or decrease in multi-task situations, and how risks can be prevented.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>440854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release gambling study</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA974982-7C64-4F70-880F-48AF253C5298</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The publication of our first paper on gambling was followed by a press release.

The teacher emailed us afterwards: &amp;quot;We all found it a fascinating experience. The feedback from the fab four students was very well informed and positive, showing that your excellent delivery of information was very accessible and engaging. They were very impressed by all they saw and very appreciative of the opportunity. The other class members who did not come for various reasons seemed to get swept along by the enthusiastic feedback and I have had a very positive and interactive lesson! They are ALL keen to go on more visits.
The students are now engaged on smoking addiction research and we have designed a questionnaire which we will repeat after an intervention campaign in the new year to see if that has been effective. We are going to include information about self control strategies in our campaign. The timing and content of the visit has been a perfect fit with our syllabus both this term and next.
We will keep updating our knowledge of the research of your team as it is published. The students have really appreciated the insight into the research processes at post graduate level and being able to get a snapshot of the variety and focus of up to date research has been so valuable. [The other teacher] and I had a very fruitful conversation about the levels of biology and psychology in the relevant research which both of us will share with our students.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>555d887404fe73.32519191</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The mysterious story of self-control, ESRC Social Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B51CA58-43A6-4D7B-9ECF-DA7212365772</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From the event website: http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/events/details/index.php?event=2342

&amp;quot;Everyday life is full of temptations, and we need good self-control to resist them. But every now and then, our self-control fails and we can no longer suppress our urges; we take risks we shouldn't take, or make impulsive decisions that we later regret.
We will tell you the mysterious story of self-control. This event, led by a research group who study how the human mind controls behaviour, introduces people to the mechanisms involved in resisting temptations. In addition, it explores how self-control may be strengthened via novel training tasks.&amp;quot;

The team has started a collaboration with the Addiction group at the University of Liverpool to explore how we can use our findings to develop such interventions. This group is currently running the first Phase 2 randomised controlled trial to examine effects of inhibition training on alcohol consumption (Trial Registation number: ISRCTN55671858). Their training tasks are already strongly influenced by our research (see Jones, McGrath, Houben, Nederkoorn, Robinson, &amp;amp; Field, 2014). 

Our work has also led to a study exploring the effects of inhibition training on weight loss and reduced calorie intake in a community sample of adults who were predominantly overweight or obese (Lawrence et al., submitted). This study was run in collaboration with the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility and the Exeter 10000 project (www.exeter10000.org). Our team is currently in discussions with Public Health Devon and the Change4Life team to explore the potential for optimising our response inhibition paradigm to complement their work (e.g their current &amp;quot;sugar swaps&amp;quot; campaign) in the form of a training game that could be made widely available via their website. 

Finally, the PI had a meeting with Phil Hawksley (Prisons Development Manager) and Charlotte Weedon (Director of Innovation and Growth) of the Exeter Drugs Project (EDP) in August 2014. The EDP is a charity that specialises in supporting people affected by drug and alcohol misuse.&amp;nbsp;It offers interventions and behaviour change services, and contacted us because it is particularly interested in&amp;nbsp;response inhibition training for gambling addiction in the prisons it works with (Devon and Dorset). Unfortunately, the EDP's contact at HMP Channings Wood indicated that whilst they are interested in principle in piloting our training task, it is not a good time or priority for them. EDP indicated that they will follow this up and also contact Dartmoor and Exeter prisons in due course.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4C6A8DB1-9944-4B92-AD3A-33A48DDB4E94</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447c99c258185.91811430</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The results of several of our studies suggest a link between motor control and decision-making in various domains. First, performance in response inhibition correlates with risk-taking when gambling (Verbruggen et al., 2013), and we have shown that response inhibition deficits are associated with addictive behaviours, such as pathological gambling (Brevers et al., 2012) and alcohol-dependence (No&amp;euml;l et al., 2013). Second, we have demonstrated that stopping motor responses influences gambling (Verbruggen, Adams, &amp;amp; Chambers, 2012; Stevens et al., 2015). This causal effect of response inhibition on gambling is present in different populations and tasks (Stevens et al., 2015). Third, we have shown that inhibition training can also influence other appetitive or compulsive behaviours, such as eating unhealthy food (Lawrence, Verbruggen, et al., 2015). Based on these findings, we propose that inhibition training influences behaviour by reducing approach tendencies and altering the motivational value of cues and outcomes (McLaren &amp;amp; Verbruggen, 2015; Stevens et al., 2015; Verbruggen, Best et al., 2014). Despite the modest effect size, this link between stopping and appetitive/compulsive behaviours (such as gambling or overeating) provides a strong incentive to further explore other avenues in an attempt to increase our understanding of human decision-making. It also suggests interventions to reduce harmful behaviour, although there is a clear need to better optimise the parameters of inhibition training to achieve clinical efficacy (Verbruggen et al., 2013).

To further explore how people can stop gambling (or what prevents them from doing so), we examined 'loss chasing' in a large series of experiments (Verbruggen, Chambers, Lawrence, McLaren, in preparation). A persistent failure to stop gambling after losses (i.e. loss chasing) could partially underlie gambling problems. We have found that subjects are generally faster to initiate a next gamble and gamble more after a loss than after a win. Even in neutral decision-making tasks, subjects responded faster if they had recently lost a gamble. This suggests that losses have a general effect on performance. Combined, our results challenge the dominant idea that humans adjust performance and increase cautiousness after suboptimal outcomes. We propose that losses are frustrating events that increase approach motivation.
 
Finally, we noticed large differences between experiments and between individuals, suggesting that inhibition training could influence behaviour in different ways. Therefore, we also investigated how people can stop inappropriate actions or suppress risky choices (Best et al., under revision; Elchelpp et al., under revision; Verbruggen, Best, et al., 2014; Verbruggen &amp;amp; Logan, in press; Verbruggen, McLaren, Chambers, 2014; Verbruggen, Stevens, &amp;amp; Chambers, 2014). This work has produced novel theoretical accounts of the interaction between going and stopping, and of how people can learn to control their behaviour. This work will be important for the optimisation of better behavioural treatments (see above). We also ran a series of simulations in this subproject (Verbruggen, Chambers, &amp;amp; Logan, 2013). We discovered that there were serious issues with currently popular methods to estimate the covert latency of the stop process. We proposed an alternative that addresses these concerns. The high citation count of this work indicates that it is already having an impact in the response-inhibition domain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Collaborators in the UK (University of Liverpool) and Europe (Universit&amp;eacute; Libre de Bruxelles) are currently testing our novel theory of self-control and behaviour change in clinical populations. This could lead to the development of new behavioural treatments for impulse-control disorders (e.g. gambling, substance abuse) and obesity (by training people to inhibit their responses to food). 

Our theoretical framework and behavioural paradigms will also be used in a psychopharmacological project that will start soon at the University of Exeter. 

Finally, we anticipate that our work on loss chasing will attract interest from both academics and non-academics as it further highlights the potential dangers of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and other electronic gambling machines.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0636510B-051B-41EE-9D24-FBBA977FCDB7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447cc6ea31570.88679237</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AE3E8A07-BFC3-4CA4-BA79-BD8272FB2934</gtr:id><gtr:title>How does response inhibition influence decision making when gambling?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental psychology.
