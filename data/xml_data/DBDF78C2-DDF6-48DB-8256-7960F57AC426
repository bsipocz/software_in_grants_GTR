Whilst the policy approach is set nationally by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) each prison develops a local policy framework to promote equality and reduce discrimination across eight 'protected characteristics'; race, sex, disability, sexual orientation, religion and belief, age, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity (MOJ, 2012).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research aims to develop a body of knowledge about the response to diversity in public and private sector prisons using three prisons from the Yorkshire region as case studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The three year project will adopt an appreciative inquiry methodology to explore:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>how prisoners in diverse minority groupings experience diversity policies and procedures in place at each establishment&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>which aspects of policies, procedures and practices in each prison are perceived by minority groups to promote feelings of respect and well-being&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how prison staff experience policies and procedures that guide their practice with prisoners from diverse minority groupings&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>ways in which diversity policies, procedures and practices in each prison could be improved to promote a greater feeling of respect and well-being in minority groups&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>explore and develop theories of intersectionality as a way of understanding how people experience prison life.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

WHO WILL BENEFIT AND HOW?
The pathways to impact in this project are not end-loaded. By involving beneficiaries throughout the course of the project impacts will occur at various times during the duration of the project and beyond. 
ACADEMIC COMMUNITY: researchers &amp;amp; theoreticians in penal policy, prison sociology/psychology understanding diversities and theorising intersectionality (in custodial settings) will benefit as outlined earlier. 
NATIONAL POLICY MAKERS: will benefit from the situated and contextualised knowledge produced, enabling the development of more informed and sensitive policies in the area of diversity; this benefit is exemplified in the production of a policy for transsexual prisoners arising from the earlier pilot research and knowledge exchange (KE) activities. 
NATIONAL OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND PRISON PARTNERS: benefits will arise at three levels, individual prisons, regionally and nationally. Senior national and regional members of the organisation benefit via participating in the Executive Steering Group, local NOMS/Prison managers will sit on specific steering groups for each prison. This direct involvement in the project will enable an immediate exchange of knowledge/findings to specific locations. At the end of data collection in each prison a report will be prepared identifying local findings. This will inform each establishment of good practices and areas where change is needed. It will also make specific recommendations in relation to improving practices. An overall report synthesising the findings from the three prisons will be distributed regionally and nationally. 
PRISON STAFF: Uniformed staff, specialist sections and prison managers will all benefit. Our earlier research indicates three sources of benefit; 1) direct participation in staff focus groups, 2) participation in the prison steering group (PSG) and 3) in the recognition of both good practice and areas to be improved identified in the research reports. In the pilot research staff morale was improved with the recognition that staff sometimes worked well in very difficult situations. Moreover, staff practices were improved as a result of KE activities following the pilot project (for example in areas relating to diversity and sensitive searching, working with gay and transsexual prisoners). Benefits also arise from the methodology employed in the research. As we have said elsewhere in this application, Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is not negatively focused, thus it identifies both good and poor practice; this twin focus allows staff not to feel negated by research (a common response to more problem focused research approaches) and it also enables them to engage positively with changing practices that are not working or are harmful.
PRISONERS: benefit from the research in a wide range of ways. Those involved in Prisoner Advisory Groups (PAG) in individual establishments benefit from ongoing involvement in a project that aims to help prisons improve their responses to diversity. Prisoner involvement in these groups is not passive; our experience shows that their involvement in PAGs is engaged, committed and positive. Prisoners respond more positively in their regimes having participated in groups where their experience and comments are valued and influential. Prisoner research participants benefit from having time to speak to people outside the prison system about their experiences. More widely, prisoner populations, in and beyond the participating prisons, will benefit from the improved responses to diversity that will emerge from this research at local, regional and national levels.
THIRD SECTOR ORGANISATIONS/CHARITIES PARTNERING WITH PRISONS: such as penal reform charities, Age Concern, Yorkshire MESMAC, Disability Alliance will benefit from the knowledge generated about diversity in prisons</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>656433</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Appreciative Inquiry Training for practitioners, doctoral students and academics</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A73CB0E-5FB8-49EC-A1A6-E48684CFE040</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A two hour appreciative inquiry training event was delivered by Prof. Charles Elliott, co-investigator, at Griffith University, Australia.

The interactive talk provoked delegates to consider three key questions 1.How might hierarchies of credibility and influence in terms of diversity be effecting the empowerment/disempowerment of certain groups within your organisation? 2.How could the concept of Intersectionality be used to enable people to &amp;quot;see diversity&amp;quot; more clearly? 3.How could adopting an Intersectional viewpoint be used to enhance research insight and Interventions that lead to change?

The panel was attended by 35 researchers, doctoral students, practitioners and policy makers. The talks generated questions, discussion and debate about the application, challenges and opportunities for using the kinds of appreciative methods used in the present research project in prisons research in European, Antipodean and African contexts; the significance of adopting research methodologies, like AI, in generating knowledge which simultaneously creates practical impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c677ac909787.04499410</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Taking a whole person response to equality in prisons' Presentation at an event organised by the Howard League for Penal Reform.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3D4B775E-DDB0-4D88-8316-E3CE18876219</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This open public event was convened by the Howard League for Penal Research.

Benchmarking was a key component of Government plans between 2013-2017 to reform, restructure and reduce the costs associated with running Public Sector Prisons. The talk presented emergent issues from the first research site about the impact of benchmarking on prison officers engagement with and views about work related to achieving equality. It also highlighted and discussed the concurrent rise of mentoring and representative roles through which prisoners support and advise other prisoners about equality need and provision. The talk was delivered by Victoria Lavis and Hugh Asher at the British Society of Criminology Conference, University of Liverpool, 10-12th July, 2014. The audience included practitioners, researchers, postgraduate students and representatives from prisons and third sector organisations. The activity sparked questions and discussions which helped generate additional avenues of inquiry in the present research project.

The changes create a potential for greater flexibility for each prison to assess and respond to the diversity specific needs of its prisoner population. The talk problematized a dichotomy, evident in early data from the current research, of 'diversity as separate' and 'diversity as embedded throughout the prison'. These ideas were explored in terms of the behaviour and levels of engagement of both staff and prisoners, the potential positive implications of embedded and supportive diversity governance on good order and discipline, dynamic prison security and effective prisoner-staff and prisoner-prisoner relationships. The talk was delivered by Victoria Lavis and Emily Turner at the Making Diversity Interventions Count conference at the University of Bradford, 17th June, 2014. The audience included practitioners, consultants, researchers, postgraduate students and representatives from prisons and third sector organisations interested in equality and diversity. The activity stimulated questions and discussions about the paucity of research exploring equalities and prison staff and the tensions created where workforces in any industry are expected to attend to the equality needs of service users in circumstances where their employing organisation does not effectively meet workforce equality needs.
