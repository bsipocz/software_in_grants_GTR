Some of these cells, such as macrophages, directly recognize harmful microorganisms. Others, such as NK cells, can recognize the changes that occur in the body's own cells when these become infected with microorganisms or develop into cancer cells. Unfortunately, NK cells can also recognize transplanted cells and may sometimes be responsible for the rejection of transplants, particularly bone marrow. This ability of immune cells to recognize microorganisms, diseased cells, or transplanted cells is mediated by the expression on the surfaces of immune cells of proteins called receptors. In order to maximize the probability of recognition, macrophages and NK cells express multiple receptors, some of which belong to a family of receptors known as the Ly49 family. Remarkably, the Ly49 receptors expressed by macrophages are different from those expressed by NK cells. In addition, each individual NK cell expresses a different combination of Ly49 receptors. A major question that arises from these findings is 'How do cells decide which receptors to express?' The answer seems to lie in the DNA found in the centre of the cell. Receptors are encoded by small sections of the DNA known as genes, and each of the many receptors expressed on immune cells is derived from a different gene. So the question becomes 'How do cells decide which genes to use?' The answer seems to lie in small pieces of DNA that have regulatory properties. Recently, a new regulatory element called Pro1 was found close to many of the Ly49 genes. Pro1 seems to function as a random on/off switch, and may therefore explain how NK cells express a random combination of Ly49 receptors. However, it does not explain why macrophages express different Ly49 receptors to those found on NK cells, nor does it explain how NK cells and macrophages can change their expression of Ly49 receptors in response to hormone-like substances released by other cells. We presume that Ly49 genes must contain other regulatory elements. The aim of this project is to search for these. To do this we will make use of information that has become available as a result of the Genome Project, a large proportion of which was undertaken in the UK, and which resulted in the complete sequencing of the DNA present in cells. A good method of finding regulatory elements is to take advantage of the fact that they are often in exposed regions of DNA and are therefore hypersensitive to attack by enzymes. We will therefore expose DNA from macrophages and NK cells to enzymes that cut the DNA, and determine exactly where these cuts are made in the Ly49 genes. Another method is to search for sites in the Ly49 genes that have undergone chemical modification, in particular the loss of methyl groups. We will also search for regions where the proteins that normally bind to the DNA have become modified, an event that frequently occurs when genes are selected for expression. Finally we will test whether these chemical modifications do indeed cause changes in the expression of Ly49 genes by treating cells with drugs that inhibit these modifications, the prediction being that this will cause changes in the pattern of expression of Ly49 receptors. The results obtained in this project are expected to provide new and important information on the workings of the immune system that will help us to better understand why animals and humans are generally resistant to microbial infection and cancer, yet sometimes succumb, and also why NK cells sometimes attack transplanted tissues. In addition, they may eventually help us to develop treatments that will enhance the ability of the immune system to fight disease and to prevent the immune system rejecting transplanted tissues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The most important function of the cells of the immune system is to recognize and destroy diseased or infected cells. The cells of the innate immune system do this in two principal ways. Myeloid-derived cells such as macrophages express receptors that directly recognize common microbial structures such as LPS. NK cells do so, at least in part, by expressing receptors that allow them to detect the reduction in expression of MHC cI molecules that frequently occurs in infected or malignant cells. In animals such as mice, a complex and diverse repertoire of NK cells is created by allowing each individual NK cell to express a small number of receptors from a pool of receptor genes that include those belonging to the Ly49 family. Until recently, this was presumed to occur through the randomized binding of certain transcription factors, present in limiting concentrations, to regulatory regions associated with receptor genes. This paradigm has been questioned by the unexpected discovery in the last year of an upstream bidirectional promoter [Pro1] associated with many of the Ly49 genes. This promoter seems to be particularly active in immature NK cells where it has been hypothesised that the direction of transcription, determined by the random mutually exclusive assembly of the transcriptional apparatus on the forward or reverse promoter elements, dictates whether the associated Ly49 gene will be activated or repressed. However, some Ly49 genes appear to lack functional Pro1 elements. In addition, the pattern of Ly49 expression varies markedly during development, and also between cell types and in response to cytokines, suggesting that additional mechanisms must be involved. One such mechanism is likely to be epigenetic changes associated with chromatin remodelling and locus accessibility. In support of this, recent studies have shown that DNA methylation may be directly involved in controlling the expression of the functionally equivalent KIR genes in humans. The aim of this project is to investigate the nature and extent of the epigenetic changes that are associated with the expression of Ly49 receptors in the mouse. Our main objectives are to map the location of DNase I hypersensitivity sites and to determine whether changes in the methylation of CpG dinucleotides and in the acetylation and methylation of histones at these or other sites are directly related to the expression of specific Ly49 genes. A key aspect of our strategy is to analyse the epigenetic status of Ly49 genes that are regulated and expressed in highly distinctive ways. In particular, we will focus primarily on three members of the Ly49 family: Ly49G, an archetypal cI receptor expressed in a stochastic manner on mature NK cells; Ly49E, which we have shown to be expressed on immature NK cells and, uniquely amongst the Ly49 family, to be induced by IL2/IL15 on mature NK cells; and Ly49B, which we have now demonstrated to be expressed in putative lymphomyeloid stem cells and in an IFN and LPS inducible manner on macrophages, but not in NK cells. As part of this project we aim map the promoter of the Ly49b gene and identify and characterize upstream sequences in this gene that might determine its tissue specificity and IFN-inducibility.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>321070</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D001218/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
