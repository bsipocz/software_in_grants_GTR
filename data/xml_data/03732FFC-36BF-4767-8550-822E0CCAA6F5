This Umayyad Empire (661-750 CE) was the largest empire besides that of the Mongols before modern times (Britain and the Soviet Union surpassed it). It was also the only empire in history conquered by armies drawn from a nomadic people to establish a new world religion and the first and last time that an Arab elite and their Arab armies ruled a world empire. \n\nMany of the central lands of the modern Muslim world were conquered in the Umayyad era: what are now Morocco and Algeria, Azerbaijan, eastern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan all fell to Islam, as did most of Spain. Some key Islamic institutions also first took shape: Islam's first monumental architecture; a distinctively Islamic coinage; a Muslim royal court culture; an Arabic tax system. The translation of Greek and Persian texts into Arabic began the Umayyad period, presaging the 'Golden Age' of Islamic philosophy and science during the next 400 years.\n\nThis was the era of 'pre-classical' Islam: no Muslim at this time would have described themselves as a 'Sunni' (the term simply did not exist); and 'Shi'i' had very different meanings from its later sense. The question of the relationship of Islam to Judaism and Christianity, the status of non-Arabs in Islam, the religious and political role of the caliphs, the meaning of the Qur'an and the nature of 'Islamic' law and practice were all unresolved in Umayyad times. \n\nAll of this early Islamic history is still often treated as somewhat separate from the rest of world history--exotic, and subject to unique laws of historical causation. However, recent developments in scholarship allow the history of the first Muslim empire to be framed in ways that better explain its development and its distinctive character, while understanding it as part of wider human history. Three approaches from outside Islamic history are particularly important: first, a theoretical understanding of the nature of imperial power in the ancient and medieval world; second, consideration of the processes that transformed the Roman and Persian world on the eve of Islam; third a theoretically informed approach to the question of political authority and legitimacy. \n\nThrough these three perspectives, this project seeks to understand more fully how the Umayyad dynasty seized control of the Prophet's religious community, and how they came to rule an expanding Arab empire successfully for 90 years. It is argued that the answers lie in the wider pattern of the failure of Roman imperial power, in which so-called 'barbarian' peoples seized the mechanisms of Roman power from their former rulers. Just as Germanic 'barbarians' in the West established new independent powers in Europe, notably the Frankish kingdom of Clovis and Charlemagne, the Arabs founded an Arabian empire in the East. Although they were late converts to Islam, the Umayyads' aristocratic heritage, and their connections with Roman Syria, left them uniquely placed to seize control of the new Arabian empire.\n\nThis project also attempts to understand better the 'structures of power' within the Umayyad empire: how extensive the control of the Umayyad family over their vast territories actually was and how they sought to persuade their armies of their authority to rule. It will argue that their political structures and institutions were shaped by the legacy of the Roman and Persian empires they had defeated, as well as by the patterns of world trade that their armies followed. At the same time, distinctive, Arabian and Muslim features can be discerned in Umayyad rule, notably in their decision to use the titles 'caliph' and 'commander of the faithful' more than 'king' or 'emperor'; these distinctive features of their rule apear to have come about because of expectations about leadership among their Arab-Muslim armies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of this research beyond academia will be interested general readers, and, ultimately, the societies to which they belong. The use of the book in universities will also ultimately have an impact far beyond academia. \n\nThere is certainly now sufficient general interest in the Arab world, Islam, and Islamic History for this particular book on the Umayyad period to have a very wide readership beyond universities. Furthermore, the perspectives on early Islamic history that it presents are not currently available to any general reader. It is hoped that they will contribute to problematizing prevalent ideas about the 'clash of civilizations', 'globalisation' and the 'essential' and unchanging character of Islam. \n\nThe late antique matrix of early Islam, in which variations on the Judaeo-Christian tradition were crucial to the articulation of ethnic and political identities is particularly important. The 'late antique' centuries during which the 'decline and fall of the Roman empire' led to the formation of Europe have proved very popular with non-academic audiences in recent years (e.g. Ward-Perkins (2005); Heather (2005); Wickham (2009)), but none of them are written by specialists on the eastern empire, nor with much reference to Sasanian Iran or Islam. One of the primary research aims behind this publication is to explain how the formation of Islam was rooted in the transformation of the classical empires during late antiquity (and thus, the extent to which Islam shares the 'cultural DNA' of western Europe--and why it at the same time seems so different from western Europe). The book should attract both readers drawn to 'Islam' and those drawn to 'empire and the fall of Rome'. These groups are still surprisingly separate, but it is intended to show each of them how their interests are related, and to challenge some of the more common assumptions about both Islam and the history of the Middle East.\n\nThe project also seeks to demonstrate how the formation of the early Muslim empire was a moment of 'pre-modern globalisation', linking Spain and France with Africa and India and generating a ferment of intellectual activity in religious thought as well as in the arts and sciences. \n\nFinally, it emphasises the historical contingency of the formation of religious and political traditions: Umayyad-era Islam was both very diverse and very different from the later 'classical' Islam which ultimately forms the basis of modern Islamic 'orthodoxies'.\n\nEdinburgh University Press' new series on Islamic Empires, in which the main output of this research will be published, will comprise 11 accessible but cutting-edge histories of the main Muslim empires from the Umayyads to the Ottomans, aimed not just at academics and university students but also the interested general reader. At present, the book has no direct competitor. Gerald Hawting's excellent The First Dynasty of Islam (London, 1986; 2000) is the standard textbook on the Umayyads in undergraduate teaching. However, it presents a political narrative, without drawing on these wider historical perspectives and theoretical approaches. \n\nThe thematic structure of this new book, its broader, 'late antique' perspective, its focus on social, economic and religious questions, and its full use of the scholarship of the last 25 years, all also set it apart. So too does its much more extensive use of images, maps and tables (c. 50 as opposed to the 6 in Hawting). Like all the volumes in this series, it will also be written with appeal to a broad audience in mind. \n\nIn the medium term, it is also hoped that the use of this book in university teaching will contribute to a fuller treatment of Islamic empire in courses on early medieval history and world history.

The Umayyad Empire was the largest premodern empire besides that of the Mongols and the only empire in history conquered by armies drawn from nomads to establish a new world religion and civilization. This was also the first and last time in history that an Arabian ruling elite and its Arab tribal armies ruled a world empire. All of the lands conquered by the Umayyads subsequently became majority Muslim. Umayyad lands are also (with the exception of Iran and points east), roughly coterminous with the core Arabophone lands of modern times. 

This project engages with the question of the imperial character of the Umayyad Empire. It seeks to answer two key research questions in particular: (1) How does the formation of the Umayyad Empire relate to the question of the 'decline and fall' (or 'transformation') of the two empires of Rome and Iran? (2) What was the nature of the 'state' and of 'imperial' power in the Umayyad period? The findings will be published in a monograph, The Umayyad Empire (Edinburgh University Press).

It is argued that the formation of the Umayyad Empire in the 7th century can be seen as part of a wider process of 'decline and fall' or 'transformation' of the late Roman world. The incorporation of the Meccan elite into Islam in 630 allowed the Umayyads to reassert their status within less than a generation. They quickly exploited existing and new connections with the Roman Levant, turning the legacy of 'barbarian' client states on the Roman Empire's desert frontier to their advantage. Thus, the Umayyad Empire was a unique variation on the wider late antique pattern of the formation of post-Roman 'successor states'. 

However, as in most premodern empires, the monarch's power was quite limited. The case is made that the organisational powers of Umayyad-era imperial institutions were in fact comparatively weak. Throughout this period the Arab-Muslims were a tiny minority, who now benefited from the existing administrative, agrarian and commercial structures of the post-Roman and post-Sasanian world. Many of the most important social, economic and cultural developments-including the evolution of Islamic religion itself-took place largely beyond the purview of the Umayyad elite. 

It is also clear that many networks of economic power and intellectual and ideological authority crossed political boundaries in the Umayyad period. Patterns of trade in the Mediterranean, Central Asia and the Indian Ocean persisted; Greek and Syriac-speaking intellectuals continued to work in the 'Islamic' Near East; Buddhists and Zoroastrians did the same in post-conquest Iran and Afghanistan. Both the extent and the importance of these 'transnational' connections in the Umayyad period remain controversial. It is argued that the extent of the continuity in trade patterns and intellectual activity from pre-Islamic times has generally been underestimated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The ideas about the formation of the Islamic world and the nature of premodern empire will be of interest to both historians and students of Islamic and world history. The research also has implications for our understanding of the relationship between 'European' and 'Middle Eastern' history, and the connections between the Islamic tradition and other religious traditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52CB0D16-F979-4177-BB18-0AB66EC2A66D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5435335a0ad137.71735603</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>969262EA-4613-44CE-A9E3-320C5862A871</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constructing the Umayyads.
