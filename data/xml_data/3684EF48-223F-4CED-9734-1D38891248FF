The governance of care policy, constitutional change and addressing inequalities - lessons for Scotland - INVITED RESUBMISSION</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K01093X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Scotland is not alone in facing a ?care crisis?; rising demand for care and support for disabled and older people coupled with social, economic and demographic changes is a challenge facing all developed welfare states. Scotland is also not alone in trying to tackle structural inequalities (particularly along the lines of gender, disability and age) which affect its ability to achieve a ?wealthier, fairer society?, and in particular focusing on fostering economic growth through older people?s, disabled people?s and women?s greater participation in public life. This project will address the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What does the international evidence tell us about the potential for care policy to address or exacerbate inequalities?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What governance options offer the best outcomes in addressing inequalities through care policy?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What role do national, regional and local care policies play in achieving equitable, fair outcomes in care policy?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What governance options in care policy should Scotland choose to achieve equitable, fair outcomes in care policy?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How would constitutional change (eg independence, or different governance structures) affect these options?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research include (but are not limited to):

1. Feminist third sector organisations in Scotland concerned with gender equality in the light of constitutional change (for example, Engender, Scottish Women's Aid, grassroots women's organisations who are organisational members of Engender)
2. Individuals who are concerned with the impact constitutional change may have on gender equality in Scotland (for example individual members of Engender, journalists and campaigners such as Lesley Riddoch, Severin Caroll, Joyce Macmillan)
3. Scottish policy networks inside the Scottish Government, and working with the Scottish Government on issues concerning gender equality (such as the Scottish Women's Budget Group, Women onto Work, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, Close the Gap, the Equalities and Budgets Advisory Group and Equalities Group in the Scottish Government)
4. Cross-party MSPs concerned with care policy and equalities issues
5. Third sector organisations representing the interests of users of care services in Scotland (e.g. the Scottish Carers National Association, the Scottish Community Care Providers Organisation, Glasgow Disability Alliance, Glasgow Centre for Independent Living)

Representatives from all the above groups have been involved in the design of this project and the linked knowledge exchange project 'Constitutional Futures: gender equality matters in a new Scotland'. See the Pathways to Impact document for details of how these groups will be involved in, and directly benefit from the project, and the Case for Support for further details of academic and non-academic dissemination.

The project has the potential to improve care policies and gender outcomes in Scotland in the following ways:

1. By improving our understanding of the link between care policy and (in)equality;
2. By improving our knowledge of the link between governance structures and (in)equitable outcomes in care policy;
3. By providing stakeholders - particularly the individuals and organisations described above - with high quality research evidence to develop their own policies and practices
4. By providing an evidence base concerning the links between care policy and (in)equality to be used to inform decision making about the options for constitutional change in Scotland
5. By providing individuals, organisations and communities of interest with the tools and evidence to carry out further research and campaign for constitutional change in Scotland
6. By providing evidence to inform the development of evidence based policy and practice inside and beyond the Scottish Government concerning care policy and gender equality

Impact in the wider non-academic community - particularly in ways which will inform the debate leading up to the referendum on Scottish independence - will be achieved through the production of policy briefings, accessible reports, press releases, virtual seminars and articles in non-academic journals, which will be disseminated through key partners (organisations, networks and journalists) in a way that will get to the wider public (e.g. union and organisational members, the general public, politicians, policy makers and practitioners).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The evidence has been used as part of the Expert Committee on Carers Allowance reporting to the Scottish Government, as well as presented to the Welfare Committee in the Scottish Government. It has been used by different organisations such as Engender, Save the Children, the Women's Equality Party and others to submit evidence to Parliament to inform the forthcoming Scotland Bill (on the devolution of welfare powers such as DLA and Carers Allowance). We expect to see results of this in the forthcoming Bill and will publish results as they become available.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0753E68-A856-4A5F-91C1-C0CC5DE61BD0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5889dde77fa905.16620232</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We found that there were three main models of care policy amongst gender-equal welfare states which had elements that could be transferred to other welfare states such as the UK, and devolved nations such as Scotland. The Universal Model (Sweden, Iceland and Denmark - other examples include Finland and Norway) uses the state to provide universal childcare and long-term care services. This offers the best gender equality outcomes, but it is difficult to achieve flexibility for individuals, and it needs substantial investment. The Partnership Model (Germany and the Netherlands - other examples include France, Luxembourg, Austria - although other examples are worse than the UK on gender equality) facilitates a partnership between individual families, the market and the state in providing services. If these services have universal coverage they can produce better gender equality outcomes whilst enabling flexibility for families and individuals. The final model, the Devolved model (Quebec - other examples include Flanders and Catalonia) demonstrate that given sufficient powers and constitutional frameworks, devolved states such as Scotland could deviate from a policy path set by central government and achieve better gender outcomes - with the caveat that coverage again needs to be universal. The Partnership Model and the Devolved Model offer the most possibilities and fewest barriers for policy transfer to the UK and Scotland.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are currently advising the Scottish Government and the UK government, as well as several charities, about our findings and hope to see elements in changes to welfare reform and childcare strategy in Scotland and the UK as a result of this advise. We are also advising the Women's Equality Party in Scotland and the UK to adjust their policy objectives in light of our findings, and hope to work with other parties such as the Green Party in the same way.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1B2A3675-A0CC-4602-9F69-C9039C5404FA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5889dcad504fd8.79372327</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B91393CE-B41E-47D3-9977-E4838834993D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Future of Social Policy in Scotland: Will Further Devolved Powers Lead to Better Social Policies for Disabled People?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Political Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c58bef3bb33420b0b8b30c4132603ef0"><gtr:id>c58bef3bb33420b0b8b30c4132603ef0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rummery K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa5447e680577.57737478</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K01093X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
