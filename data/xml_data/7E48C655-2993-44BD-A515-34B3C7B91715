The monograph is approximately 100,000 words in length and is due to be published by John Murray publishers in June 2008.

This work of creative non-fiction investigates the entire life of the notorious gaol, from its initial construction in 1087 to its destruction in 1902, and is envisioned as a more intimate and narrative pendant study to such acclaimed criminal histories as Robert Hughes's Fatal Shore (1986) and Linda Colley's Captives (2002). Where those works sought to rehabilitate the forgotten penal past on the fringes of empire, Newgate: the Biography of a Prison reconstructs instead the neglected sagas of suffering that inspired writers and artists at the very heart of British society for nearly a millennium.

Organized around the four catastrophic fires that threatened to abolish the prison in the eleventh, fourteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, the book resuscitates not only the lives of the highwaymen and murderers who were condemned there, but also the religious and political martyrs, the philanthropists and philosophers, the poets and reformers who were inspired by its appalling allure. Caches of neglected diaries, letters and journals in archive expose the true extent to which Newgate provided the grim setting for extraordinary political plots, heroic religious martyrdoms, improbable escapes, as well as profound, long-forgotten suffering of the voiceless poor. The period of research funded by the AHRC leave award-- from February through May of this year-- enabled me to concentrate on Part Ill of the project, and the last era of the gaol's existence, from the Gordon Riots in 1780 until the prison's demolition in 1902.

For over eight-hundred years, until the institution's demise at the beginning of the twentieth century, Newgate prison was the grimy axle around which British society slowly rotated. This is where such legendary outlaws as Robin Hood and Captain Kidd ended their days, where the rapier-wielding playwrights Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe sharpened their quills, and flamboyant footpads like Claude Duvall and James Maclaine left legions of women visitors to the prison swooning. While theatres in Covent Garden and Southwark came and went, for centuries Newgate, universally referred to simply as The Gaol, endured as London's unofficial stage. This is where many of England's greatest dramas unfolded --from the Peasant's Revolt in the fourteenth century to the Great Fire in the seventeenth, from the Gordon Riots in the eighteenth century to the heroic philanthropy of Elizabeth Fry in the nineteenth. By piecing together the lives of forgotten figures as well as re-examining the prison's links with more famous individuals, from Dick Whittington to Charles Dickens, from Jack Ketch to Madam Tussaud, this thrilling history goes in search of a ghostly place, now erased by time, but which has inspired more poems and plays, paintings and novels, than any other structure in British history.

The monograph not only cast much-needed light on one of the darkest bastions of London's seamy underground; its tales of forgotten abuse have a telling resonance for the present-day reader. Throughout the pages of this biography, the anguished ghosts of Newgate echo down the ages and speak powerfully to twenty-first century predicaments of those who around the world fall foul of the law</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E505686/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE53E60A-FE46-433C-BA16-151F707B335F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Creative Writing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C52A4D58-78E0-4598-9ED6-DB919A085333</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History &amp; Dev. of English Lang</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
