High temperatures and pressures develop within the oil film between the gear teeth. Real gears, particularly in aerospace transmissions, may have finely machined surfaces and appear smooth but on the microscopic scale of the lubricant film they are rough. The peaks of these rough surfaces (known as asperities) often come into contact with each other. These conditions can lead to failure of the lubricant film itself, wear, surface damage and gradual cracking (fatigue), none of which are desirable in an aircraft engine for example!
When a material undergoes deformation (such as occurs when rough surfaces come into loaded contact) a rapid release of energy in the form of transient elastic waves occurs, known as Acoustic Emission (AE). These waves can be recorded using sensors mounted on the material, and AE methods have been widely used in monitoring structures where they have been shown to out-perform other methods. In gear systems, asperity contact, wear, surface damage or cracking causes acoustic emissions to occur. 
This project focusses on the development of an advanced computational model to predict the levels of AE generation due to asperity interaction within a lubricated contact, such as those found between gear teeth. This asperity interaction has been found by previous researchers to be a significant part of the AE signal from a pair of meshing gears. The work will form a key part of a long-term aim of developing the use of AE monitoring techniques for high speed, heavily loaded power transmission gearing.
The work will include both the development of the computational models, which are based on strain energy calculations and advanced simulations of pressures and shear stresses within the lubricant film, together with a comprehensive experimental programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed programme of research forms part of the PI's overall research roadmap leading to the development of acoustic emission (AE) based techniques for health monitoring of power transmission gearing. This will ultimately benefit users of heavily loaded, high-speed power transmission gearing in a range of industries. Chiefly, the current research will investigate the generation of acoustic emission by asperity contact in lubricated contacts, typical of those in power transmission gearing, which is a key component of the proposed gear health monitoring system.

Users of gearing in safety-critical environments, such as the civil and military aviation industries, will derive benefit from this in a number of ways. Firstly, the eventual system will directly improve safety levels as it will provide continuous monitoring of gear health and earlier identification of problems when compared to the sole use of current techniques. It will also allow reductions in ownership and operation costs, by allowing increased maintenance and inspection intervals, together with increased aircraft availability and reduced un-planned downtime. Within the aerospace industry, some of the most arduous operating conditions for gear systems can be found in helicopters, and it is anticipated that the long-term outcomes of this research will enable the UK to take a world-lead in helicopter logistics and operations.

Other potential users of the AE techniques include the power generation (both conventional and renewable energy), marine and automotive industries. For example, a closer understanding of asperity contact levels, and the ability to monitor these levels, will be of great benefit to those seeking to reduce surface-failure issues within bearings and gears in wind turbine gearboxes. Furthermore, monitoring techniques are becoming essential as renewable energy generation capacity is installed in inaccessible, or inhospitable conditions both on and off-shore.

The research will also benefit the Acoustic Emission industry itself, by providing a key part of the scientific knowledge necessary to develop a commercially-viable monitoring system for power transmission gearing. This can introduce AE technology to new markets in which such methods were not previously available. The industry will benefit via increased software and hardware sales and consultancy activities, leading to higher employment levels and increased revenue generation.

Finally, the UK scientific and engineering base will benefit via the development of highly skilled researchers and PhD students, which this grant will facilitate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>80000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Kuwait, State of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Kuwaiti Government PhD Studentship Scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Kuwait University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>FB691D14-C2C9-4803-A4ED-32487B567764</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c4d03e5b94.04807217</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings from this grant have been used on current work with SKF Aerospace UK Ltd, developing methods for monitoring (using AE) of bearing liners in spherical plain bearings.

It has explored this through a series of experimental tests on disk machines (alongside contact resistance techniques), and on full scale bearing testing rigs. This has highlighted that asperity interaction (metallic contact between microscopic &amp;quot;high spots&amp;quot; on the surface roughness) is a source of Acoustic Emission, and this is confirmed by independent measures (e.g. contact resistance techniques). Techniques for assessing the AE signals in terms of frequency content have been developed and applied, and show that there is a strong dependence of activity below 500kHz on levels of asperity interaction, as quantified by the lambda ratio. Furthermore, a model of the variation of strain energy within a lubricated contact has been developed, which allows the prediction of energy release due to strain energy fluctuations at the contact. The model includes the mixed lubrication of rough surfaces and, notably, uses real measured surface data rather than a statistical approach. This is being written up for publication.
The research has also demonstrated that there remain significant challenges in isolating the AE from asperity interaction against the high levels of background emission generated within rotating machinery. The frequency-based techniques used in this project have gone some way towards overcoming this difficulty. In addition, exploring the AE generated by rough surface interaction has generated a significant data set of the evolution of surface micro-geometry as surfaces run in, and fail due to micropitting fatigue (a common, asperity-level surface fatigue mechanism associated with mixed lubrication conditions). This has demonstrated a potential link between initial surface modification during running-in, and subsequent fatigue failure.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings may result in further academic study of:
1) Acoustic Emission in rotating machinery, in particular gearboxes and bearings, to use the findings from this research to quantify the health of a lubricated contact in terms of surface distress and failure
2) Further investigation of the links between initial running-in, mixed lubrication operating conditions (i.e. levels of asperity contact) and subsequent micro-pitting failure

In terms of non-Academic impact, the findings offer users of machinery which relies on mixed-Elastohydrodynamic contacts (e.g. power transmission gearing, helicopter and geared turbo-fan transmissions, renewable energy transmissions such as wind turbine gearboxes etc) further information and guidance on the use of Acoustic Emission as a sensitive method of detecting the early onset of failure. As such, this could allow health-based maintenance and earlier detection of incipient failure at a stage where it can be more easily managed, when compared to currently used health monitoring techniques.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52212CA3-0118-4878-B016-091E46F8363C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e01ee5f00360.42484213</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset concerns the generation of acoustic emission by surfaces in lubricated contact under mixed lubrication conditions where there is a lubricant film present, but where there is also significant interaction of asperities on the contacting surfaces. The research investigated the correlation between contact conditions (via consideration of the lambda ratio) and the generation of AE in experiments conducted using twin disc machines, and additionally in real components using a rolling-element bearing test rig. Furthermore, data on surface modification during the running-in process and micropitting failure were recorded during the disc machine testing, together with electrical contact resistance measurements to indicate the level of metallic contact. The dataset consists of three groups of files - these are (1) the electrical contact resistance and running-in data files, stored as text files (2) the raw wavestream files from the disk machine tests (stored in plain text format) and (3) the parametric AE and raw wavestream data from disk machine tests, also in text file
