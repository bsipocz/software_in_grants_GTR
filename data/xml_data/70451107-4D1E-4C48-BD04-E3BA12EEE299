Policy challenges around excluded asylum-seekers and migrants suspected of serious criminality but who cannot be removed</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L015463/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>1. This project brings together a network of academics, policy-makers and policy bodies to stimulate new cross-boundary debate on the challenges posed to national and international public policy by excluded asylum-seekers and other migrants who are suspected of serious criminality but cannot be removed.

2. Impediments to the expulsion of migrants suspected or convicted of serious criminality pose an increasing challenge for public policy in both the national and international spheres. These obstacles can be 'practical', such as the lack of means to send the person to their country of origin, or 'legal' in nature, as where human rights standards prevent removal. However, even though such cases appear comparatively few in number, they tend to attract significant public interest due to the real concerns that they generate for State migration control, the integrity of the institution of asylum, the role of human rights in contemporary society, and the bringing to justice of perpetrators of serious crimes. 

3. This network project analyses and debates the problem in Europe, North America and South America. Among the far-reaching questions to be addressed are: 

- What are the scale and key characteristics of the problem and policy response in a selective sample of a range of the most-affected States?
- Do these cases represent the emergence of a 'fundamental system error' (van Wijk) in international law or merely a practical problem in application of the law?
- How should humanitarian issues of 'international protection' be balanced against international criminal law imperatives to counteract impunity?
- Can law respond to address the 'legal limbo' in which such persons find themselves and resolve their situation one way or the other? Are other tools required?
- What are the implications of this situation for the wider legitimacy of refugee law and human rights law? How should these wider contexts inform the search for a solution?
- How should future policy development in relation to this problem take place? What would a coherent and uniform policy on this topic look like?

4. This multi-disciplinary project generates an exchange of ideas on its core themes through promoting research and debate in relevant fields. It operates principally through a Stakeholder group of academics, policy-makers and wider policy bodies. It further facilitates the co-production of knowledge in this area through a range of activities, such as the following proposed conferences and workshops:

- 2015 Amsterdam Workshop.
- 2015 Refugee Research Network moderated online discussion.
- 2016 London Conference with Stakeholders and other academics and practitioners. 
- 2015 Network report launch panels with academics and practitioners in London, Amsterdam and Brussels. 

Further practical and academic impact will be secured through targeted follow-up activities with different beneficiary and 'user' stakeholders participating in these events.

5. The project seeks to generate mid-long term impact 'through people' to address the security and justice challenges that these cases present by:

- Facilitating the review, development and improvement of State policies in this area;
- Assisting international policy bodies to develop consistent policy in this area; and 
- Helping to promote an informed public debate on the topic. 

The project will also yield mid-to-long term impact in terms of international leadership and partnerships by promoting international academic collaboration and academic-practitioner partnerships and by increasing the international visibility of UK academic research. 

6. The project is based upon international collaboration between the Refugee Law Initiative in the UK and the Center for International Criminal Justice in the Netherlands. The expertise, contacts and networks brought by these two specialised academic centres underpin the success of the network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. The project's main practical objective is to assist in resolving the challenges for national and international policy-makers posed by the situation of excluded asylum-seekers and other migrants suspected of serious criminality but who cannot be removed from the territory. This long-term impact will be realised through the fulfilment of five short-to-medium term impacts. These will be secured through targeted activities to maximise the opportunities for users in governments, international organisations and agencies, the third sector, as well as the wider public, to benefit from the work and outputs of the network. 

(a) Law, policy and practice: Government policy-makers
The initial pathway for achieving positive changes in this area is through key government policy-makers. Key officials from seven selected States will contribute directly to the work of the project as part of the crucial 2014-2016 Stakeholder group in order to maximise its impact on users. The 2016 London Conference provides a basis for further impact through participation in the debates. Follow-up will be conducted from the UK and the Netherlands by the PI and CI, including through the launch events for the conference report. 

(b) Policy and practice: EU (international organisation)
The membership of the EU is particularly affected by the problems addressed by the network project. The key EU official in this field has been invited to contribute to the Stakeholder group 2014-2016. Through the EU government participants, the State-related activities mentioned above constitute another pathway to impact at this level, which will be utilised also by the project. The PI and CI will also conduct a special launch of the project report in Brussels with EU officials and representatives who have confirmed an interest in these themes.

(c) Policy and practice: UNHCR (international agency)
UNHCR requires research and debate on this topic to orient policy and practice with governments and victims. At headquarters level, senior officials charged with developing international policy in relation to asylum-seekers excluded from refugee status will participate in the Stakeholder group 2014-16, including in the 2016 London Conference. Impact upon the international agency will be multiplied through its activities in advising States and funding local partners in the field.

(d) Practice: Third sector
The third sector has the potential to play an important role in responding to the needs of excluded asylum-seekers and other migrants in a similar situation. The RLI has extensive contacts among professional bodies and non-governmental organisations in the refugee field. The CICJ contacts in the international justice field are equally wide-ranging. These will enable the PI and CI to incorporate third sector engagement in the dissemination processes described above, particularly the Conference and project launch events. 

(e) Perceptions in the media and wider society
Media presentations of the challenges relating to this class of migrants can be shallow and misleading. Using the UK, Netherlands and European media contacts of the PI, CI and other Stakeholders, the PI and CI will seek to promote a more informed debate through writing newspaper and web articles and giving interviews on radio and television. 

2. Additional impact will be created by ongoing dissemination of research outputs via academic/practitioner networks, forums, websites and journals. Impact via all of the above pathways will be mutually reinforcing, e.g. impact on policy of international agencies influences State policy, which is later adopted on the regional level. 

3. The project also yields 'international leadership' and 'partnerships' impacts by extending academic-practitioner collaboration in the contact group and other activities, stimulating the co-production of knowledge, and increasing the visibility of UK academic research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37307</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Setting Policy Standards for Those Who Are Excluded from Convention Refugee Status but Cannot Be Returned to Their Countries of Origin' - Roundtable at CARFMS 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA783C8F-7AEF-4599-8B98-55E63A94A60E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CARFMS 2016: ROUND TABLE, 'Setting Policy Standards for Those Who Are Excluded from Convention Refugee Status but Cannot Be Returned to Their Countries of Origin', at the conference of the Canadian Association for Refugee and Forced Migration Studies (CARFMS), 'Exploring a Path from Armed Conflict, Persecution, and Forced Migration to Conflict Resolution, Human Rights, and Development', Winnipeg, Canada 12th May 2016.

The presentation was received by the government representations with great interest, considering the number of questions that member states put forward subsequent to the presentation. The discussion did not suggest specific solutions or innovative policy responses to the limbo problem, but the audience did acknowledge the negative side effects of the lack of a coherent approach to the problem, such as the roaming around in Europe of undesirable and unreturnable migrants.

- January 2016 London conference 

2. Reflection and potential for shift in views among the many government representatives who engaged with the presentation by co-investigator Dr Joris van Wijk to the inter-governmental European Migration Network National Contact Points in November 2015.

3.

In particular, the different kinds of 'undesirability' involved suggest that one single policy response to this group of persons is likely to be inappropriate. Instead, the different discrete profiles within this wider group generate distinct problems that should be addressed by distinct legal and policy tools.

Based on this understanding, the project has also generated many new research questions about responses to the diverse groups of 'undesirable but unreturnable' migrants in different countries. For instance, might the identified structural determinants of this situation be addressed by discrete policy measures in order to reduce the overall number of persons who end up falling into the 'undesirable but unreturnable' limbo situation? What are the prospects for a coordinated international or regional response to this contemporary legal and policy challenge? 

Even though the project has achieved success among academics, policy-makers and practitioners, it has struggled to change law or to capture the attention of the media in the UK. Within these highly political spheres, the debate on 'undesirable but unreturnable' migrants seems to resist admitting a deeper or broader perspective on the empirical dimensions of the situation or on possible fixes to the policy challenges, which continue to be obscured by highly polarised discourse, not least in the context of Brexit discussions in the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project findings - as published in the final report/policy brief and in two journal special issues to be published in March 2017 - provide an important first-ever baseline of comparative research into the otherwise relatively understudied phenomenon of 'undesirable but unreturnable' migrants. For academic beneficiaries, this has generated a range of new research questions around this subject area, which we expect to see garner even greater momentum following the publication of the two March 2017 journal special issues. For policy-makers, the policy advice and wider research provide a platform for beginning to refine responses at the national level to 'undesirable but unreturnable' migrants. More widely, the project findings could usefully be taken forward into political debates on this issue, especially as they play out in the news media, although finding a way to do so has proved challenging thus far.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FA2AE4D8-5905-4F9E-922E-CACDEF3D7A3F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf2dc7296c34.20318093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://oldsite.sas.ac.uk/sites/default/files/files/RLI/ubufull%20(1).pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Project researchers advising Dutch Probation Service on how to deal with Undesirable/Unreturnable migrants</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F0C42F2D-2492-4DD5-9482-25925D4CD115</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b3ec2b2fbbe0.71622945</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>93ADBC5E-2124-4746-8E44-E0A9337F17C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Undesirable but Unreturnable Migrants in the Netherlands</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Refugee Survey Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ecd7b02dd4f34a83da2f448c3120a85e"><gtr:id>ecd7b02dd4f34a83da2f448c3120a85e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bolhuis M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b3f07ba18100.05281473</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F377FA3-E7FC-488F-924D-A08EA7056A58</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Emperor's New Clothing: National Responses to &amp;quot;Undesirable and Unreturnable&amp;quot;
