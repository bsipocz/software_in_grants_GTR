This focus on online entrepreneurship accords well with the unique strengths of the Open University in providing its teaching and learning online. It also allows colleagues from outside the field of entrepreneurship, such as those with a background in information systems and e-business, to work collaboratively with those with expertise in entrepreneurship.&lt;/p>

&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is of significant interest and value to individuals currently running small online business and organisations providing advice to such micro businesses.

The research design is intended to allow us to gain access to such groups early in the study and hence be able to shape our dissemination and impact activities according to the needs and preferences that we learn about from this interaction. For example, the strand of work that involves the international comparison with online home based entrepreneurs is based on face to face interviews and hence will require us to identify such individuals and to undertake interviews with them. Part of these interviews will include understanding how they would prefer to access the findings of the research and how these findings can be translated into impact for them. As well as approach individual entrepreneurs, we plan to approach small business organisations, such as the Federation of Small Businesses and the National Enterprise Network, as a means of gaining access to suitable research subjects. As a quid pro quo for such introductions, we will seek to work with these organisations to make our findings available to their members in ways that best suit their needs. If possible, we will seek to follow up with these organisations in order to understand the impact of the research findings on their members.

In the case of the proposed work in Pakistan, we will seek to work with non-governmental organisations and social enterprises that support small scale entrepreneurship, such as the Pasha Social Innovation Fund and the Pakistan Women's Business Incubation Centre. Again, the quid pro quo for introductions to locally based online entrepreneurs is that we will seek to make our findings available to their members in ways that best suit the needs of those members.

The findings of the research are also of interest and potential value to the wider general public, some of which may be encouraged to develop an online home based business. For this group of research users, we would seek to make the findings of the work available across a range of channels that can be easily accessed. The findings of the study will be made available on both the Open University's and the Open University Business School's research web pages. Rather than wait until the end of the project, we will aim to publish on-going findings at regular intervals, in order to generate and maintain interest in the work. From time to time the work will be featured as a news item on these sites and other Open University web estate (e.g. our alumni sites), in order to draw attention and drive visitors to the findings. We will also utilise the University's Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn channels, all of which have many thousands of followers. We will also seek to make an album of the findings available on iTunes U. The Open University is one of the most successful Universities making content freely available on iTunes and hence available on a wide range of mobile devices such as iPods, iPhones and iPads. To date, the Business School has been involved in 29 different albums resulting in 1.5 million downloads. In addition to online media, we will make the findings available in traditional print media, such as through appropriate practitioner publications.

Additionally, any peer-reviewed publications arising from this grant will be registered on the Open University's open access institutional repository - Open Research Online (ORO) at http://oro.open.ac.uk. ORO is one of the largest repositories in the UK. The site receives an average of 40,000 visitors per month from over 200 different countries and territories and has received over 2.5 million visitors since 2006. It enables access to research outputs via common search engines including Google, by using the OAI (Open Archives Initiative) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings will be of interest and value to those teaching entrepreneurship and new business formation. Such modules are often very popular across all levels of study (undergraduate, postgraduate and executive education). The findings of this study provide new understanding and insights that are being incorporated into such modules. On the other hand, some of the organisations that represent and advise ethnic entrepreneurs find our research interesting and that some of our findings are either new or different to their experiences.</gtr:description><gtr:id>700508B2-F5A5-4E1E-B6AD-9264B5E8DA94</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>541aa99d574944.79116285</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have explored the Characteristics of online home based entrepreneurs and businesses, and developed a model of entrepreneur-venture fit. We found that home based businesses have certain challenging demands, such as engendering feelings of isolation. Online home based businesses can provide entrepreneurial opportunities to groups and individuals who may be otherwise excluded. Online home based businesses could offer additional opportunities to extant home based entrepreneurs in developing countries or allow others to benefit from such opportunities. 

Online home based businesses offer opportunities for ethnic entrepreneurs to leverage existing skills or experience. These businesses of course provide opportunity for entrepreneurs with IT skills but they also offer opportunity to individuals without IT skill to leverage other skills such as accountancy, dress and jewellery design. We also discussed about entrepreneur visas which attract individuals from outside Europe, who can contribute to social and economic development of UK. Our study shows that the unique characteristics of online home based businesses can allow individuals with drive and creativity, but without formal qualification, to operate entrepreneurial businesses, suggesting policy should find ways of moving beyond the emphasis on formal qualification for the allocation of visa. 

We also explored the role of space and place in the operation of online home based businesses which suggested that each entrepreneur would find their own balance on the type of their business and personal and family circumstances, and this may vary over time. We also suggested that many online home-based entrepreneurs operate in a middle-state between the dichotomous extremes of location dependent or independent, which we refer to as 'tethered'. In such a mode the business has a primary location, but the entrepreneur can operate from other locations for appropriate periods.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research provides evidence of online home based entrepreneurs founding and operating new and innovative digital businesses which will be of direct value to the formulation of evidence based policy.

This research can also be used by online home based business entrepreneurs or the ones who are thinking of developing such businesses to know about the experiences of other online home based business entrepreneurs and their businesses. 

This research can be extended and used to further develop online adult learning programmes such as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) which are very popular these days.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1DF54067-9D58-4B7F-A827-E5B1B6CA2037</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>541aaaabe0bdb7.35674211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
