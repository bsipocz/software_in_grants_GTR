A major key to this quest lies in what goes on inside classrooms, where children derive the bulk of their daily experiences in academic and social learning. While factors like the physical condition of the school building, textbooks, and teacher degrees play a role in children's learning and life outcomes, they are small and indirect. Teacher instructional practices and classroom processes, in terms of supportiveness and organization, play considerable roles in children's learning and well being outcomes. Yet, the focus of many attempts to improve (and evaluate) educational programs has been based on classic, though simple, input-output model. In other words, an intervention takes place, and then the change in child academic or social outcomes are measured. Studies of this type can be viewed as &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; studies; they tell us little more than whether the program worked or not. They fail to provide us with insights on how to more effectively facilitate deeper learning. To do this, we first need to be able to effectively measure instructional practices and classroom processes. 

The most accurate way of measuring instructional practices and classroom processes is with the use of observational methods. To date, available methods have been too labor-intensive and costly for large-scale evaluation studies or for use in daily practice. Reliable, valid, cost-effective, and practically useful tools are needed. Nowhere is this truer than in low-income and fragile states. This is the goal of the proposed investigation. 

To achieve these ends, we capitalize on a large-scale experimental school and classroom-based intervention program undertaken in Ugandan public secondary schools by the World Bank (WB), in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES). In a second phase of this project, the WB enlisted New York University (NYU) to supplement the impact evaluation by examining the instructional practices and classroom processes with live observations using an innovative tool, known as TIPPS, before, in the middle, and at the end of the intervention year. Samples of these classrooms are also videotaped for more intensive analysis. This data provides a unique opportunity to further develop and validate an innovative, affordable, scalable, and practically useful tool for assessing teacher practices and classroom processes. It also has the potential to provide feedback to teachers, especially when used in tandem with mentoring and reflected practice for improved teacher performance. We conduct a series of scientific studies to assure the viability, validity, and utility of this instrument.

In addition to the development and validation of an effective classroom observational instrument, we want to assure its use in policy and practice in Uganda and eventually in other low-income and fragile states. Thus, we begin the project year by working closely with the various stakeholder groups - ministry, union officials, school administrators, teachers, and World Bank Africa Region staff - to facilitate buy-in and ownership. We will engage them in interviews and focus groups to both inform them about the instrument and to gain their assistance in structuring the end of the year workshops for maximum effectiveness. The goals of these workshops are to explain our findings with regard to the intervention and the tool, and more importantly, so that the tool can be implemented at policy levels by the ministry, with the aide of the unions. In this manner, this tool could then be put into practical use in secondary schools around the country, and eventually primary schools as well.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In recent years, Uganda has faced challenges in its education system due the advent of Universal Secondary Education (USE). Maximizing teacher impact in the current environment has consistently emerged as an area of focus. Perhaps the most vocal around this issue has been that the ministry itself, expressing the desire for an evidenced-based understanding of the teaching and learning that takes place in Ugandan classrooms. Currently, the MoES continues to cultivate its Digital Science Initiative, a major goal of which is to create a catalogue of classroom content to capture Ugandan teaching practices. Systematic analysis of classrooms through live observation brings one level of interest for the ministry, but the fact that this proposed study is accompanied by a rich library of classroom video content places our analysis at a distinct advantage in terms of depth of insight we can provide. This proposal has the ability to provide a critical window into the instructional practices and classroom processes of interventions as well as everyday practice. 

However, it is of paramount importance that a clear message be communicated around teacher observations - both live and video. The recent trend of declining educational outcomes has created pressures for teachers, compounded following the teacher strikes in September 2013. The Ministry of Finance has allocated additional funds for teacher pay raises - a boon for the teacher's union - but this has subsequently put the entire education sector under severe scrutiny to perform well. Classroom observations are not meant to be evidence for punitive action; they should not be used to create a culture of fear. Thus, the inclusion of Uganda National Teacher's Union (UNATU) in these dialogues is necessary to ensure appropriate ownership by another set of key stakeholders - the teachers. We would be remiss not to mention the views of teachers we have encountered through this study, who have often shown as much interest in feedback from observation as the ministry. The feedback mechanism has not been developed as a part of the current intervention, but the need and desire is there. In conjunction with mentoring and reflective practice, practices already somewhat in place through local Center Coordinating Tutors (CCTs), a feedback device for educational practitioners that has been validated could be invaluable for improving practices. Yet in doing so, we must be able to uphold and ensure the rights and privacy of the teachers throughout the process.

We will engage these two key beneficiaries in a consultative process throughout the life of this project. We will begin by cultivating relationships with the groups respectively (i.e. introductory meetings with the MoE and UNATU) at the onset of the project in order to provide individualized attention and sensitization to the study. The culmination of conversations and data analyses would be presented in a workshop/seminar with key stakeholders (i.e., Ministry of Education and Sports, Uganda National Teacher's Union (UNATU), World Bank, civil society organizations), where we expect to bring a common level of understanding around the need, significance, and practicality around classroom observation as well as to bring some consensus on how to collaboratively address any obstacles (see &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot; for further details). In this forum, we can collectively consider and address concomitant issues such as cost and sustainability, understanding that classroom observations are generally more demanding in terms of time and financial resources. Nevertheless, the trade-offs are worthwhile when we consider the countless millions that have been spent in Uganda on other teaching and learning inputs that have not shown any real impact in improving student outcomes. The message must be conveyed that government, and Uganda as a whole, cannot afford to continue to let money go to waste with no results in student learning outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151215</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>STIR Education</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Uganda, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>NYU - STIR Education Uganda Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>988125A9-E28B-4DD7-9A77-86CDBCC41B92</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Currently there are no outputs or outcomes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d89b5c6fcc89.91159818-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>STIR Uganda is interested in understanding the processes at play in classrooms as well as the impact of formal and informal teacher networks in Eastern Uganda.

There has been immense interest in this instrument from several educational sectors, and NGOs in particular. In several low-and-middle-income countries interest has been expressed in creating feedback mechanisms for the teachers. 
In the Ugandan context, the Ministry of Education and Sports, the teaching colleges and universities, and the teacher unions will be armed with additional information and techniques to further improve the quality of education in Ugandan classrooms. In part, these Pathways to Influence elements of the proposal will be facilitated by our emerging collaboration with STIR Education Uganda. We are currently working with them to enhance the stakeholders' workshop that is planned for May 2016 where a Learning Improvement Group will be held and include participants from District Education Offices and Departments (DEO, DIS), among others. Both STIR and the TIPPS team think there is much potential in encouraging more evidence-based practices among DEOs, DIS's, etc. in order to stimulate more of a focus on educational quality rather than inspection. 
In addition to Uganda, the TIPPS is already being used in Ghana and India, and is planned for use Pakistan. With the completion of the remaining planned analyses, the Ministry of Education and Sports, the teaching colleges and universities, and the teacher unions will be armed with additional information and techniques to further improve the quality of education in Ugandan classrooms.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>40FC4B1F-D867-4985-B2B3-AA1BCF7271D0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d8a032b28d42.29631760</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We begin with a description of the empirical findings, and then turn to how this work has begun to infuse our partner NGO organization and the ministry of education collaborators in Uganda and beyond.
 
Empirical Findings: As previously noted, TIPPS looks into assessing quality of instruction in Ugandan secondary school classrooms. The first major finding is the we uncovered a conceptually meaningful and interesting 3-factor structure. Initially, this structure was revealed in an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the 2013 TIPPS data, with modifications based on the fit parameters, confirmed in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the 2014 TIPPS data: (i) Instructional Strategies, (ii) Sensitive and Connected Teaching, and (iii) Deeper Learning. The second major finding is that the Deeper Leaning factor was concurrently associated with academic performance. More specifically, performance in Math and English on the National Assessment of Progress in Education (NAPE) was significantly predicted by TIPPS factors, and accounted for primarily by the Deeper Learning factor. Interestingly, the directionality is opposite in these two subjects. Deeper Learning is associated with significantly higher math performance and lower English performance. For Biology, there were no significant findings. Delving deeper into the concepts revealed that the Scaffolding concept was carrying the weight of the Deeper Learning factor. That is, as teachers engage in more scaffolding their classes perform better in Math. When we turn to English classes, the concept that is most strongly associated with performance is the provision of Specific feedback, while Connects activities and subject matter to achieve larger instructional concepts and objectives was inversely associated with average classroom English performance. Collectively, these findings suggest a specificity hypothesis that particular instructional strategies are associated differentially with performance in different subjects.

Impact in Uganda and beyond: The highlight of our impact in Uganda was the series of workshops we co-led with STiR Education, which was attended by hundreds of teachers, administrators, educational policy makers, union officials, including District Education Officers and District Inspectorate Services. We broke down the findings by regions and districts, and discussed what the findings meant for the different leaders and how they might implement them. We also spent considerable time discussing how TIPPS could be used in both in-service training and pre-service education. Our partnership with STiR and the ministry continues and has now expanded to India. We have, and continue to receive many requests for use of TIPPS regarding different developmental levels and cultural contexts. In particular, we developed the primary level TIPPS for a preliminary study with Kaivalya Education Foundation in India. As part of a collaboration with colleagues from University of Pennsylvania and Innovations for Poverty Action, we developed the pre-primary level TIPPS that was used as part of impact evaluation. Preliminary findings indicate improvement of the training program on TIPPS factors -- Supporting student expression and Emotional support and behavior management. We also partnered with Tele-Taleem Pakistan to propose a cluster randomized trial to measure teaching and learning in remote rural areas of Pakistan that was an unfunded finalist.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have been working with different academic and practitioner partners to utilize this research on measuring instructional practices and classroom processes in low and middle-income countries. We have and will continue to engage academic colleagues in the further development of this measure. In particular, we have presented at multiple academic forums, have papers under development for publication to disseminate these findings, and initiated discussions with scholars at several universities (e.g., American University-Sharjah, Funda&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Getulio Vargas Brazil, University of California-Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania, New York University). In a proposal to ESRC's closed call under review, we plan to take this work forward. With practitioners, we are conducting and supporting colleagues in programmatic evaluation with TIPPS. Such work has been undertaken in Ghana and Uganda in pre-schools, in primary schools in India (KEF), and in secondary schools in Uganda and India (STiR Education). In particular, this work is informing our partners decision making, and the education ministries with whom they work closely, on developing pre-service training and in-service support using TIPPS as a feedback tool to improve performance. This is a shift from stand-alone teacher development initiatives to tailor training to improve the learning conduciveness of the classroom.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CE0932C6-57E2-46FB-B3B0-46E1DBEB4DAA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8a00e8f1bd9.02402570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/global-ties/advanced_methods/tipps</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M004740/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9B2F1F6E-2F07-4F8E-A221-DFB5E1C9FB9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Edu Sociocloy/Sociology of Edu</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>544E9837-9640-4AAB-93EB-416962206DD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education and School</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51E91F17-25CD-4FBD-917E-1BD82B72BDB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical &amp; Statistic Psych</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>548B6279-0479-4E80-BC7C-3E5308CF61BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
