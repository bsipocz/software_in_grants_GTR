The development of novel man-made chemical compounds imitating the active centre of some natural enzymes that are capable of damaging messenger RNA provides a basis for generating new useful tools of modern chemical biology, perhaps even drugs, affecting specific messenger RNAs and viral genetic material. Recently a considerable effort has been made in the creation of chemical ribonucleases, catalytic molecules capable of damaging RNA molecules irreversibly at desired positions. These compounds can potentially be applicable to a range of problems in biomedical areas and public healthcare and also in various areas of life sciences and chemical biology. However, the problem of unsatisfactory biological performance of metal-free chemical ribonucleases remains unsolved. Recently, in the frame of our collaborative work with a Russian research group, a new type of chemical nuclease, showing very unusual biological properties, was discovered. These novel compounds were constructed by chemical fusion of short, synthetic protein-like molecules with synthetic DNA fragments. The most remarkable feature of these novel catalytic molecules was that the short DNA fragment enormously enhanced the biological activity of a previously inactive protein-like molecule. Our preliminary study showed that the merger of these two chemical entities seems to produce a new, hybrid type of molecule that can synergistically combine the individual properties of the two components to yield a new and unusual biological ability. The DNA-like component seems to induce an `active` structure of the protein-like fragment and hence significantly enhance its catalytic performance. However, the basic, fundamental processes behind this unusual discovery have never been studied. The great challenge is therefore to provide an understanding at the molecular level of how these functionally significant entities (i.e. the short synthetic protein-like molecule and the short DNA fragment) interact with each other and mutually change their functions. The aim of this proposal is therefore to determine the structural rules and molecular mechanisms which govern biological activity of these novel synthetic catalysts and control whether these molecules can recognize and specifically cleave another molecule. Success in this area will provide us with a chemical means to develop novel tools for chemical biology, such as catalysts with increased activity, altered specificity and improved storage properties compared to natural enzymes. We already have obtained experimental evidence that the molecules we are designing can provide specific and efficient cleavage, but now we need to understand the fine molecular mechanisms managing these processes. To achieve this we have to put this research onto a solid experimental basis through high resolution structural studies and a high-level computational approach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>205914</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Novosibirsk</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Russian Federation</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Research Group of Prof. Vlassov</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8CCB8FB-4AC2-4F7B-A44D-D60D504FD2E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

In spite of impressive advances made toward the development of sequence-specific artificial ribonucleases, the problem of insufficient efficiency of the existing metal-independent chemical ribonucleases, their poor selectivity and low catalytic turnover remains unmet. Recently, a new type of peptidyl-oligonucleotide chemical nucleases (PCNs), showing very unusual catalytic and structural properties, has been discovered. These novel oligonucleotide-mediated chemical nucleases were constructed by chemical conjugation of short, catalytically inactive oligopeptides containing alternating basic and hydrophobic amino acids with an oligonucleotide component, which are poorly or non-complementary to RNA target regions. The most remarkable feature of these novel biocatalysts was that the covalently attached oligonucleotide units induced catalytic activity of a previously inactive peptide and modulated its cleavage specificity towards RNA. However, the lack of knowledge of the structural aspects behind this discovery hinders the development of a new generation of peptidyl-oligonucleotide conjugates. Also, very little is known about the modes of interactions between peptidyl-oligonucleotide chemical ribonucleases and target RNA sequences, which create the additional barrier for improved design of new structural variants of PCN with an appropriate balance between sequence-specificity and high catalytic turnover.



The aim of this research, therefore, was to investigate the structural aspects of this class of catalytic artificial ribonucleases using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as their modes of interactions with the complementary and non-complementary RNA sequences using fluorescence, UV-visible spectroscopy, and Tm profile studies.



To achieve this, the selected model conjugates were synthesised and their identity confirmed using HPLC, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. The challenge here was to investigate how these functionally significant entities (peptide and oligonucleotide) interact with each other within the conjugate and cross-modulate their activities. The analysis of NOESY of the selected model systems allowed the identification of inter-proton interactions within these structures and provide the information about mutual orientations of the fragments and interactions between the individual components. These structural studies provided sufficient evidence that both oligonucleotide and peptide cross-modulate each other's conformations leading to the formation of a new entity with unique structural properties. 



The final stage of this research was aimed to study the key modes of interactions between PCNs and different RNA sequences. To achieve this, binding experiments between the selected PCNs (non-fluorescent and fluorescently-labelled) and FAM-labelled RNA targets were carried out to follow the fluorescence and UV-visible response upon interaction. The oligonucleotide was shown to play the dominant role in the interactions between the selected conjugates and the complementary target in the presence of a high level of counter cations, which were sufficient to prevent repulsion between the complementary strands. The peptide component seems to become the key player in these interactions, when the concentrations of counter cations are insufficient or negligible. It was also demonstrated that the studied model conjugates are capable of forming strong complexes with non-complementary RNA sequences at low concentrations of counter cations or in their absence, presumably due to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbones of the RNA and the positively charged arginines of the conjugates. This mode of binding, which is mainly mediated by the peptide moiety via electrostatic interactions with the RNA strand, seems to represent the only possibility for interactions between the non-complementary RNA and the conjugate in water.



The 3D structure of the hybrid complex between the model conjugate and the RNA target was resolved using NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling. The oligonucleotide double-stranded region of the hybrid molecule was in agreement with the right-handed DNA with a contribution from both A and B forms. It was confirmed that the interactions between the conjugate and RNA target was driven by two major binding modes, which involve electrostatic interactions and Watson-Crick base-pairing. On the other hand, interactions between the conjugate and the non-complementary RNA sequence were qualitatively confirmed to be driven via electrostatic interactions only and mediated by the oligopeptide fragment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One of the major pharmaceutical challenges today is the development of more powerful, highly selective therapies against abnormal gene expression in disease states, which would allow lower chemotherapeutic doses and thus more tolerable side effects. The key research findings of this research project suggested some new strategic directions in the development of novel therapeutics, which may inspire discovery of novel therapeutic approaches and thus allow expanding the therapeutic window in drug discovery process. The main focus of the research funded by EPSRC was the development of highly specific, synthetic enzymes capable of damaging nucleic acids. The use of these catalytic systems can potentially affect the essence of cellular life and the translation of the genetic information of an individual into their physical make-up. These engineered chemical enzymes imitating the active centre of natural enzymes and capable of damaging messenger RNA provide a basis for generating new useful tools of modern chemical biology, perhaps even drugs affecting specific messenger RNAs and viral genetic material. 



These chemical nucleases consisting of multiple catalytic elements may offer a gene-specific approach to chemotherapy where a disease that involves the production of a harmful protein could be treated by antisense interference with a disease-relevant mRNA. Therefore, the possible routes of exploitation of the project outcomes include basic science research (current exploitation) as well as potential bio-medical and clinical applications (future exploitation).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C16AFC17-6CC5-4D13-BE85-6D6BA5D6DD01</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3399561106.5994587774fc31c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>40A0618E-B7C0-48ED-8C16-C9269D77D5C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Synthetic Biology for RNA manipulation: rational design of supramolecular biocatalytic systems'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d31ff6915292fc27f253918bcd5de490"><gtr:id>d31ff6915292fc27f253918bcd5de490</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Elena Bichenkova (Speaker)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_351972818413ded286</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AC8EBAE6-3C92-4D67-8FF7-753CA09C0206</gtr:id><gtr:title>'New approaches for the development of nucleic acid based therapeutics: challenges and opportunities in RNA targeting'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Drug Discovery</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/45411bb3215a08109baebb04a968255a"><gtr:id>45411bb3215a08109baebb04a968255a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Elena Bichenkova (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_519515458413803d48</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9E09F902-092E-4394-8CBF-6244B1C4478E</gtr:id><gtr:title>'New approaches for development of nucleic acid based therapeutics: challenges and opportunities in RNA targeting'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cd58690745ec1ac2b9ac06c1f51f4d1a"><gtr:id>cd58690745ec1ac2b9ac06c1f51f4d1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bichenkova E.V.
