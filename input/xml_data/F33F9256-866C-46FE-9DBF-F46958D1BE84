The Politics of Knowledge Transfer in Public Health</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K001728/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project will explore: how individuals involved in developing UK public health policies are experiencing efforts to increase/improve the use of evidence (eg what policymakers think about ?research impact? agendas and guidelines for increasing/improving the use of evidence in policy); and what role third sector and commercial organisations play in mediating/translating public health knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aims are: to unpack some of the assumptions underlying contemporary debates about ?evidence-based policy? and ?research impact?; to explore the interactions of values, politics and evidence; and to further develop an ideational framework for understanding relationships between research and policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In practical terms, the intention is to collaborate with potential research users to develop sector-specific recommendations for using public health research to improve policies (rather than simply trying to increase the flow of public health evidence into policy).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To achieve this, the project combines five methodological approaches: literature reviews; assessing policy tools/guidance designed to improve the use of public health evidence in policy; a series of ethnographic placements in relevant third sector organisations; in-depth interviews with politicians and individuals working in relevant roles in the civil service, commercial sector and third sector; and an online Delphi survey of these sectors.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project seeks to influence the ways in which various groups approach the promotion of public health evidence in policy, with the intention of supporting evidence use that improves public health policies &amp;amp; their outcomes (whilst minimising any associated risks). The following six groups are the most likely beneficiaries:
1. Public health policymakers: the project aims to ensure that researchers who attempt to engage with policymakers do so in ways which are feasible &amp;amp; beneficial for policymakers. It will explore how policymakers perceive &amp;amp; experience ongoing commitments to 'evidence-based policy' &amp;amp; newer emphases on 'research impact' &amp;amp; will seek to identify any concerns relating to these agendas. It will subsequently attempt to ensure relevant guidance addresses any identifiable concerns. The views of this group have already shaped the research proposal &amp;amp; will continue to inform the research as it progresses, including at the dissemination stage. This will involve a cross-sector seminar, a policy briefing, a project web-site, blog contributions, the offer of bespoke oral presentations &amp;amp; the development of a manual &amp;amp; Continuing Professional Development course.
2. Third sector organisations with an interest in public health: the project will provide important insights into how these actors view the relationship between public health research &amp;amp; policy and what role they play within this. The findings will be used to help ensure these groups are appropriately considered within guidelines for improving the use of public health evidence in policy. As above, the views of third sector public health organisations have informed the proposal and will continue to do so throughout the project. The findings will be promoted to this group via similar methods to those used for policymakers, a process which will be aided by the networks developed during the placements.
3. Academics interested in studying, theorising &amp;amp;/or improving knowledge translation and research impact: the project will weave together existing theories about knowledge transfer (including my own) with data and theories concerning the role of key 'research mediators' (third sector &amp;amp; commercial interests). This group will be invited to the workshop and will be targeted via conference papers, short commentaries (e.g. on the LSE impact blog, OpenDemocracy and the Times Higher Education Supplement) &amp;amp; all five peer-review journal articles: (see Academic Beneficiaries &amp;amp; Case for Support)
4. Public health researchers: the project will aim to improve the available guidance for public health researchers interested in achieving effective &amp;amp; ethical research impacts. It will seek to increase awareness within this group of: (i) policymakers' perceptions of the various tools &amp;amp; systems that are currently being promoted as means of increasing the use of evidence in policy; &amp;amp; (ii) the potential role of 'research mediators', such as third sector &amp;amp; commercial organisations, in the relationship between public health research &amp;amp; policy. Information for this group will be promoted via public health blogs &amp;amp; virtual networks, conference papers &amp;amp; at least three of the five peer-review journal articles (see Academic Beneficiaries &amp;amp; Case for Support for further details)
5. Organisations working to improve the relationship between research and policy, such as the ESRC, MRC and RCUK: the project will make a series of specific recommendations as to how 'impact' guidance provided by research funders &amp;amp; others might be improved in the basis of the findings, paying particular attention to the incorporation of potential 'research mediators'.
6. The impetus for all of the above is to improve the use of public health evidence in policymaking in ways that will lead to better health outcomes. Hence, the final group of potential beneficiaries, indirectly but still crucially, are those individuals and communities who currently bear the brunt of the UK's major public health problems</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researchers, Campaigners and Corporations: Who is trying to influence policy responses to health inequalities in the UK and what role is evidence playing in these debates?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>33AF1552-9CEA-45B8-B8EA-5E2F846C9D86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk informed a lot of discussion within this stream of the conference.

To date, my research has directly informed conversations about this at Cancer Research UK, Action on Smoking and Health Scotland, the British Medication Association, the Institute of Alcohol Studies and Alcohol Focus Scotland. I also drafted briefing documents on health inequalities for ASH Scotland and the Institute of Alcohol Studies, and other briefing notes relating to health inequalities for Cancer Research UK and the BMA. All of these briefing notes have been published by the respective organisations. I have also led a series of debates and conversations about such engagement with my fellow academics and given invited talks, based on this research, in the Scottish Parliament and European Parliament. One of the key findings from this research related to the lack of public engagement in research, policy and advocacy discussions on health inequalities. I have subsequently followed this up in two key ways: (1) through a deliberative, citizens' jury research project (funded by a Leverhulme award); and (2) by working with the People's Health Movement in Scotland. Several of the research outputs from this project remain in process / in press and some of these will now be informed by the citizens' juries follow up work - as soon as these are available, my plan is to provide both communities with guidance documents relating to the findings which will be presented in person and provided online and which will be updated to reflect feedback. I can then update this narrative impact account.

In addition, I drew on the findings of this project in an editorial for the BMJ which challenged a Cabinet Office (UK government) anti-lobbying clause which would have restricted the freedom of researchers to draw on publicly funded research in contributing to public and policy debates (http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i1446). This clause, which was widely criticised, was subsequently dropped.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>92C41F58-5E35-405C-878C-272EDDE65584</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>560e7062e45ef8.98018076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This work undertaken during this project has generated new knowledge about:
- Policy and advocacy experiences of using 'evidence-tools' such as 'impact assessments', cost-benefit analyses, systematic reviews and economic modelling. It identifies a range of perceived benefits to, and disadvantages of, these tools as mechanisms for enhancing the use of evidence in public health decision-making and debates. Tools, such as economic scenario modelling, which can provide concrete answers to policy questions but which are perceived (in contrast to cost-benefit analysis) to be sufficiently complex for real-life policy problems appear to be the most popular 'evidence-tools' among policy actors. Systematic reviews were widely critiqued for failing to provide clear policy guidance; the only examples participants identified as having played an important role in policy debates had been commissioned/used to support a preferred policy position had already emerged. Impact assessments tended to be seen as potentially time-consuming exercises which were also largely developed on a post-hoc basis. 
- Policy, third sector and academic experiences of the UK research 'impact agenda'. This work identifies ten concerns about the research impact agenda and makes a series of suggestions for how incentive, monitoring and reward frameworks for research impact might be improved to better reflect the available evidence concerning policy change. My aim is to use this work to develop/inform new guidance in this area.
- Public health researchers' varying support for policy responses to health inequalities. This work identifies a high degree of consensus around the types of policy responses that researchers believe are most likely to reduce health inequalities but a lack of specificity within this. It also demonstrates that researchers responses to questions about preferred policy solutions vary when they are asked to based their responses on their 'expert opinion' compared to 'the strength of the available evidence'.
- Public health researchers', third sector and policy actors' varying views about the actual and desirable relationship between public health research and advocacy.
- Public health research, policy and advocacy perspectives on the actual and desirable role of different kinds of commercial interests in public health debates. 
- The complex ways in which corporate advocacy coalitions work to influence long-term policy change. 
- The preferred future health inequalities research agendas of different sectors.

In addition, through a series of short-term secondments to third sector organisations (and some related longer-term relationships that emerged), the work is informing the development of a cross-sector network of organisations within an interest in addressing health inequalities in Scotland.

The findings have also informed the following new research questions about the complex relationship between evidence and democracy:
- How do policy actors (in public, private and third sector organisations) assess 'public perceptions' of particular policy issues, such as health inequalities, and of potential policy responses?
- How are efforts to promote health inequalities research, and research-informed policy solutions, to the wider public being received?
- Does public opinion about health inequalities, and potential policy responses, appear to change when people are given an opportunity to engage with the available evidence?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Public health researchers could use the findings to improve the means by which they work to achieve research impact, including through evidence-informed advocacy. Health inequalities researchers can also use this work to inform decisions about which areas of future health inequalities research to prioritise. I will be working to raise awareness of relevant aspects of the findings for these audiences through academic publications, conferences and related blogs.

Third sector organisations could use this research to improve their use of research evidence and I will shortly be develop some guidance materials for third sector organisations on accessing, using and citing research evidence and working with academic researchers. I will also be returning to some of the third sector organisations which hosted me for short-term placements to provide more bespoke advice.

Finally, I will be using the findings to inform a series of debates with academic and policy actors around the 'research impact' agenda and I will use both the existing results and the results of these debates to develop some suggestions for research funders and those involved in the architecture of REF in the UK to consider improving the way in which 'research impact' is incentivised, monitored and rewarded.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F74FF998-8E05-4B0C-9943-5D4EAFD59B5B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>560ea22e63b282.27639774</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_policy/katherine_smith</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>00C48BBA-EC72-4167-9B25-19FBFBD728FB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The politics of ideas: The complex interplay of health inequalities research and policy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science and Public Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8c65241deefa75bc8b856b8d7eaef7cf"><gtr:id>8c65241deefa75bc8b856b8d7eaef7cf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f94494479cce66</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>92E595C5-7BC7-4870-AB73-956D237A805D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding responses to the political context of health inequalities in research and policy: Can post-structural theories of power help?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Theory &amp;
