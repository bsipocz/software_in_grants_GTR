Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is the most common cause of visual impairment in people with diabetes. This condition is characterised by swelling in the centre of the retina. 240,000 people with diabetes in the UK have DMO. When DMO affects the central few degrees of vision, it causes visual impairment. All patients with early DMO are referred from screening centres into hospital eye service to be monitored more closely for progression of DMO. However, there is no treatment in this early stage of DMO. Once the disease progresses, patients are treated with laser or by injecting drugs that block a compound called VEGF into the eyeball. These treatments are used in many retinal diseases that cause fluid to accumulate in the central retina such as age related macular degneration. However, these treatments are not always successful and are expensive and invasive. We propose to carry out a clinical study to find out if and how sleeping in dim light reverses or slows down the progression of early DMO. Given that VEGF is the main factor that causes the retinal swelling, any procedure that reduces the excess VEGF in the eye would help prevent DMO. The most important cause of elevation of VEGF is reduced oxygen, which occurs in diabetes, especially in the retina because the cells absorbing light (rods) demand so much. The extra demand only occurs in darkness. Therefore by sleeping in dim light, retinal demand for oxygen would decrease and hence DMO might be reduced. Two small, short, clinical trials support this view. We need a robust clinical study to investigate whether sleeping with a light-mask at night will reduce the swelling in the retina. So we will perform a clinical study at 10 centres. 300 patients with early DMO will be randomised into 2 groups. One half will use ?light masks? which illuminate the closed eyelids with dim light during sleep. The other half will use masks without light (dummy masks) so that the light level will be zero, as a control. The masks have been subject to stringent safety checks but we will report all adverse effects and the effect on sleep will be evaluated. The patients will have standard tests to monitor the progression of DMO for 24 months: the changes in vision and the structure of the retina will be monitored at regular time-points. 30 patients will also undergo further tests to evaluate the scientific basis of oxygen demand and dim light on the retina. The team assembled has vast experience of such trials and we have linked clinicians, scientists, statistician and members of an accredited Clinical Trials Unit to provide expert help with analysis of the results. The numbers of staff and resources requested are the minimum needed to ensure that this project and the associated scientific studies are conducted to the very highest international standards. Finally, this is a major study that has the potential to identify a new and non-invasive treatment in early DMO and prevent progression to the centre.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Research Design: A multicentre Phase III Randomised Controlled Single-Masked Clinical trial to test the clinical efficacy of light-masks at preventing dark adaptation in the treatment of early (non-centre involving diabetic macular oedema (DMO). A subset of patients (n=30)will have additional mechanistic evaluations. Study population: Participants will include people with type I and type II diabetes referred to eye clinics from the Diabetes Screening Service, with OCT evidence of non-centre involving DMO in whom laser can be deferred for at least 6 months. Planned interventions:The active intervention group will wear light-masks with an output of 100 cd.m2 at night during sleep. The control arm will wear a ?dummy mask? in which the light output is zero. Compliance will be monitored randomly, using data-loggers that monitor mask charging current. The primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline in absolute thickness of the zone of maximum retinal thickness as determined by OCT at 12 months. Secondary outcomes measures at 12 and 24 months include proportion requiring macular laser or antiVEGF treatment; change in retinal thickness in all ETDRS zones; change in visual acuity; safety and tolerability; change in measures on the validated sleep questionnaires. Assessment and follow up: Patients will be seen at 4 monthly intervals for 2 years. Proposed sample size: With 300 patients, we anticipate 240 to be followed up (20% dropout). This is sufficient to provide 90% power to detect a 15 micrometre in mean change of retinal thickness at the zone of maximal thickness between arms using a two sided analysis of covariance test, adjusting for baseline, at the 5% level of significance, assuming a standard deviation of 35.7 micrometres. Statistical analysis: The primary outcome will be analysed using two-sided analysis of covariance between groups receiving lightmasks (active) and dummy masks (control), with adjustment for baseline. The primary timepoint will be 12 months. Sample size will be reassessed when 50 patients complete six-month follow-up. Analysis of covariance, logistic regression, and Cox regression will also be undertaken to analyse secondary and mechanistic outcomes of continuous, binary and time to occurrence type respectively. Project timetables including recruitment rate: This is a 42 months study. We have previously recruited 42 patient in 6 months at one centre. So we expect recruitment to be completed in 12 months. The follow-up is for 24 months. The primary outcome analyses will be done at 12 months and all secondary outcome measures will be done at 12 and 24 months. Analyses on mechanstic evaluation will be done when the 30 participants complete the 12 months follow-up.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298008</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F09E44D7-0463-4DD0-8DB3-E7172F6184B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>A multicentre phase III randomised controlled single-masked clinical trial evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of light-masks at preventing dark-adaptation in the treatment of early diabetic macular oedema (CLEOPATRA): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/986a77af633bb564fd1c381deeb5438b"><gtr:id>986a77af633bb564fd1c381deeb5438b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sivaprasad S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1745-6215</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c2976165f381.70948206</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_14137</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>A9061818-9B1E-495A-9617-7C77200827C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Eye</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>4CFCFE99-281F-452D-9C77-757ECDBEB0DC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.3  Medical devices</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
