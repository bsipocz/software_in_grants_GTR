Moreover, the very understanding of what counts as political thought will differ from culture to culture. The comparative liberalism project will constitute an initial step in exploring the epistemological parameters of thinking about politics in different societies. We shall have to investigate whether a set of political beliefs and arguments so central to Europe and North American political thinking is perceived very differently in an Asian context, the extent to which liberalism is a meaningful term to begin with, and to which it is substituted by other local belief systems that intersect with it or replace it. This will require, among others, assessing the differential weight assigned to liberal arguments and concepts within the selected political cultures. In the medium term it is hoped that the fruits of this project will begin to change some of the ways in which political thought is taught at British universities. \n\nThe network will be co-ordinated by a principal organizer and a core committee drawn from the Centre for Political Theory and Ideologies at the University of Sheffield and the Centre for Political Ideologies at the University of Oxford. This will include Professor Mike Kenny and Professor Andrew Vincent in Sheffield, and in Oxford Professor Michael Freeden and Dr Marc Stears. The co-ordinating committee will meet once every two months and will have more regular telephone and electronic communication and will be able to edit the shared website. In addition to the co-ordinating committee and the principal organiser, each individual workshop will have a local organizer based in Oxford, Columbia, Delhi and Beijing. In Oxford this role will be played by Professor Michael Freeden, in Columbia by Professor Sudipta Kamiraj, in Beijing by Professor Li Quang (Peking University) and in Delhi by Professor Rajeev Bhargava (Delhi University). The key themes for each workshop will be decided upon six months prior to each workshop through consultation of the local organizer, the principal organizer and the workshop co-ordinating committee. General logistical support will be provided by the two research Centres both of which have extensive experience in international collaboration of this kind. \n\nThe Centres in Sheffield and Oxford are able to build upon recent and current initiatives that have laid foundations for such a network. Workshops at Oxford (2003) and Prague (2005), have now been joined by the exploration of liberalism and nationalism at a Budapest workshop (2006). Initial talks have been ongoing with East European, Italian, Indian and American scholars, as well as with British scholars within the two Centres for Political Ideologies, at SOAS, and at other British universities. We also hope to link up with a project initiated by European conceptual historians, who have been receptive to the approaches to ideologies fostered in Oxford and Sheffield. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39571</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F001711/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33E5E05F-68BD-4527-AEE5-B1E47B0D67FA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
