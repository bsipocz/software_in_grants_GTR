For these migrants, thrust into an alien cultural environment, ethnic associationalism and social networking are among the most common responses to life in the new home. Yet despite its long history, the persistence of ethnic associations and networks among migrants in the Far East has received little attention.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project offers the first sustained reading of present-day expatriate social networks and associational forms in Asia within the wider context of their historical antecedents, moving beyond the traditional focus on Anglophone cultures in the former British Empire in Asia by comparing contemporary migrant community life of British and German expats. The principal project objectives are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to provide a close analysis of the emergence and development of contemporary ethnic associations among migrants from Britain and Germany&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to offer a knowledge-shaping reading of cultural organisations and diplomatic missions that operate within the wider circles of expatriate community life&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to interact with current expatriate groups, the stakeholders of the organisations to be studied in this research, as well as policy makers.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is carefully designed to ensure that the wider public will benefit from the research. First, the proposed programme of community engagement will ensure the dissemination of findings among the immediate user groups. This chiefly includes members of British and German expatriate communities in the Asian sites of study. These communities will benefit from the research as details on association activities and networking processes will offer them a new perspective on their immediate life experiences. The project website will showcase material and provide an interactive platform to facilitate transnational interaction and user exchange throughout Asia and beyond.

Secondly, research findings will be relevant for the cultural organisations and embassies identified. Many activities they promote, though not outwardly 'ethnic', are a key channel through which interactions of expatriates are filtered. Therefore, it is hoped that research findings will aid the development of more targeted engagement between organisations, their respective user groups, and the host society. This may extend to stakeholders in the host society, specifically those in the culture and heritage sector, facilitating collaborations between culture organisations from abroad and local museums or community groups. As a result, the research also holds potential to inform, and contribute directly to, educational and cultural initiatives in the culture sector in the sites of study, constituting a timely contribution to the wider debates about migration and identity in Asia.

To ensure that the non-academic users concerned have ample opportunities to benefit from the research, engagement activities in all sites of study will be integral to the project from the outset. In view of the specific primary user group of the research, a range of different impact strategies will be pursued to ensure that users will benefit from the research as fully as possible. The project website and user exchange platform will be supplemented by communication activities within expatriate communities, utilising social media as well as more traditional means of communication. Research findings will be prepared in a suitable way for this type of exchange, tailored towards users. Most importantly, there will be a series of events in the Asian sites of study at three points in time throughout the project's lifetime, with a dedicated impact phase taking place at the end of the project. These events will directly engage users groups with the research, and, where possible, activities will include training sessions for association members and expatriates in which they will be able to actively use research outcomes to learn about their immediate life world. Communication channels within expatriate communities will be utilised to ensure effective and wide circulation of information on research findings and events, seeking to facilitate opportunities for user engagement. The end-of-project conference, while also targeting an academic audience, will be developed to suit a 'blended' constituency of academics and non-academics, the latter including stakeholders and policy makers who are beneficiaries of this research (e.g. staff from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office). With that in mind, the PI will explore opportunities to host the conference in conjunction with relevant stakeholders or think tanks (e.g. Counterpoint).

Media liaison will be integral to disseminating the results of this project. The local press in the Asian sites of study will be contacted in advance of research visits to ensure wide dissemination of the research, and also to publicise events to be held. Ideally, there will also be opportunities for research findings to feed into press reports and local radio programmes. The media in Britain and Germany will also be approached with findings, as it too runs stories dealing with expatriate communities abroad.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>discussion with team of Friedrich-Ebert Foundation in London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B8A27A0-FCB6-4E6D-A6B9-C14F8308BDFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>discussion designed to inform about my project; sparked questions and brought on the way a discussion re: future collaborations for the purpose of wider public engagement; might involve policymakers etc within the wider context of British-German relations that the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation seeks to foster

In particular the exhibition shows images of the transformation of Hong Kong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a result of the British presence there, including exhibits relating to the associational culture of early expats (which is, in part, the focus of my ESRC project). The aim was for me to get a chance to engage with other guests - mostly British expats living in Hong Kong now - about my ESRC project, sharing information about it as well as stimulating their thinking about expat life.

imrpoved understanding among expats of the historical role of social networking; however, at this stage the impact is necessarily limited still as my project has not advanced enough yet to carry activities to their fullest potential -- this will happen in the future. In that sense this initial engagement was a facilitation activity for future initiatives.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5457673cd0c322.99303907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Impact will continue beyond the lifetime of the funded project (see also Key Findings). Initial impacts beyond the academy are traceable already. In particular this relates to work with the immediate research users of the research - current expats in Asia, and particularly their life experience of ethnic association. With groups, such as the Hong Kond St Andrew's Society, having expressed an interest in better understanding their community history, results from the research have been used to co-produce, together with a Society Chieftain, a history of key aspects of the association's activities, specifically the annual St Andrew's Ball which has been in existance since the late 19th century. Further engagament activities are planned in relation to this to enhance the research users' understanding of this histroy. In in future, the aim is to continue this work, with further community activities planned, but also work more closely with heritage sector stakeholders, policy makers and also comapanies with an expat staff base.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D96098CC-A59F-478F-B606-E7DCB3938E4B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cf04cfa3a627.68063736</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Framed by a transnational and longitudinal line of inquiry, the project's overall aim was to trace change and/or persistence in the role ethnic and cultural organisations play in British and German expatriate social networking in Asia. Within the context of this aim, the project has generated significant new knowledge about the lives of present-day expats and how they see the role of ethnic associations today. Interviews and surveys reveal that ethnicity continues to shape behaviour, but that the extent to which this happens today is dependent on a wider range of factors than has historically been the case. As the project's history component has revealed, when ethnic clubs and associations were first established in the nineteenth century, the offered one of only a very limited number of tools expats could employ to make home in Asia, a sojourner world. In the present, online platforms and other innovations in networking mean that a much broader range of tools are available to expats. Nevertheless, the research still points to the fact that ethnic associations remain a strong response to the challenges of a highly transient environment, particularly in places where the differences in lifestyle and everyday challenges are more pronounced (e.g. Beijing). 

The project identified a number of new research resources, including the records of associations catering for expats who returned to Britain and Germany, and a number of previously unknown community magazines from ethnic clubs and societies. Where possible these have been collected and digitised (e.g. annual reports of the China Association) to facilitate future research. Moreover, towards the end of the project new material relating to questions concerning old age and elderly care in British and German expat communities in Asia was unearthed; a new research project has already been developed as a result.

A number of unforeseen practical challenges had to be dealt with throughout the project's lifetime, and subsequently did have a minor impact on the research plan. This was the case because both Thailand and China, two of the project's sites of study, saw a number of political upheavals and subsequent changes to visa regulations that meant that some of the planned research trips had to be changed, and one (to Thailand) cancelled altogether due to security concerns at the time. While it was possible to divert activities to other case study sites, this has meant a reduced number of interviews for some sites. To offset this to some extent, methods were adapted to provide for an additional data capturing method (online survey-style interviews). Overall, this has not changed the nature of the study nor had a detrimental impact, but it is worth considering the imbalance in material and this is something I will address in the methods sections of the project monograph. 

Apart from data outputs (interviews, surveys and databases of associations) and impact outputs (co-produced community history), the academic outputs to date include one journal article (as planned this was co-authored with the project's postdoc) and a book chapter in an edited collection. At present I am preparing the draft of the monograph, which will be the principal project output.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are two principal ways in which I will take findings forward:

Development of new research 
The most immediate path forward relates to new materials shedding light on elderly care in British and German diaspora communities in Asia. There are significant numbers of expats who, although they would like to return home, are, for financial reasons, unable to do so. I thus developed a research project to open a new inroad into examining immigrant health, particularly the question of elderly care, through the lens of ethnicity, focusing on the provisions made by ethnic associations and related groups such as the China Coast Community in Hong Kong. In particular, I am interested in how such groups utilise ethnicity and ethnic heritage to develop elderly care solutions, with a view to exploit such solutions for present-day dementia care. A funding bid for seed funding was submitted to the Wellcome Trust.

For impact purposes
With all data now gathered, there remains an important impact route to pursue with policy makers and companies (to work with them on how they can better engage expats), as well as ongoing work with ethnic associations in the sites of study (this will include more community history projects and I am presently also exploring the idea of developing an app for expats to engage them with the history of clubs and their sites of residence).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>118BB831-2E96-4800-9393-F83492ECE652</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf1f05410139.34593826</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Individual membership databases for British and German ethnic associations in case study locations (Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai); these databases vary in terms of information and scope - simply as a result of the very diverse local source bases and available material for the different locations.
