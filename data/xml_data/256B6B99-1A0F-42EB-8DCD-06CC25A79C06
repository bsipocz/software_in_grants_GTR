The underlying philosophical question at issue in the project concerns the relation between necessity and freedom, or between submission to socio-economic constraints on the one hand, and emancipatory self-determination on the other. 
 Louis-Auguste Blanqui (1805-1881) was arguably the single most important figure in nineteenth-century French revolutionary politics, and he played a significant role, directly or indirectly, in all of the great upheavals that punctuated his life (1830, 1848, 1870-71). He was certainly the most forceful and controversial of those who sought to renew and then to transform the radical Jacobin tradition that drew its inspiration from Rousseau's conception of 'a free society of equals', a society sustained by collective participation in a general will to posit, debate and accomplish goals consistent with the common good.
 At odds with followers of Proudhon on the one hand and of Marx on the other, while Blanqui commanded unrivalled authority in French revolutionary circles during parts of his lifetime he was quickly forgotten after his death. Although he only resorted to underground forms of political organisation during periods when police repression and censorship blocked all overt agitation for social change (notably in the 1830s and late 1860s), his willingness to rely on conspiracy as a means to popular insurrection led him to be condemned, across the political spectrum, as a mere putchist, and a failed putchist to boot. There has been no searching engagement with Blanqui's work or legacy, in either French or English, since the middle of the twentieth century.
 There are two main reasons why this most indomitable of 'failures' deserves to be recovered from historical oblivion. First, Blanqui's distinctive understanding of social problems and political processes is under-appreciated and misunderstood. In large part, this is because of the relative difficulty of accessing his writings, most of which exist only as scattered manuscript fragments, held by the French national library in Paris. In addition to enabling detailed critical engagement with his work via publications, translations and two international conferences, this project will make the entirety of Blanqui's writings available to the public for the first time, through a website that will include high quality reproductions of his many publications and all 26 volumes of his manuscripts, along with a comprehensive selection of critical assessments of Blanqui by figures ranging from Tocqueville and Engels to Bensa&amp;iuml;d and Ranci&amp;egrave;re. 
 A second and more urgent reason for a return to Blanqui, today, is that his work provides a vivid way of framing one of the central questions at issue in any theory of political action, regarding its willed or voluntary quality: to what extent is political action best understood in terms of the actors' own deliberation, purpose and resolve, rather than by the purportedly 'deeper' logics of e.g. economic development, historical tendency, providential design, technological innovation, cultural differentiation, unconscious drive? Against the great majority of today's most influential critical theorists and European philosophers (including the later Heidegger, Adorno, Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault, Agamben, Latour), this project aims to develop and defend an unabashedly voluntarist conception of the political subject.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Blanqui dedicated his life to a radical transformation of the prevailing order of things, and it would far-fetched to pretend that a project devoted to his legacy might be warmly received by the sorts of institutions and interests he hoped to undermine. If the project may thus not make much of a direct impact on official policy-makers and the commercial sector, it should strike a powerful chord with a wide range of protest movements, civic groups, student activists, and pressure groups or NGOs that rely on forms of direct action, as well as with sections of the media and the wider public - indeed with anyone concerned with democracy in the strong, literal sense of the word. 
 Blanqui's experience in the midst of the popular mobilisations that overthrew the Restoration monarchy in 1830 made him a lifelong believer in popular empowerment, and in particular the power of the people to overcome any and every form of domination, even when the possibility of such an outcome might seem, to a distant observer, to be very unlikely. At each of the political turning points he confronts, Blanqui assumes that if the people are prepared to do what is necessary to exercise their power, and if they understand what its consequences entail, then, when they are suitably concentrated and organised in a large city like Paris, they already have all the resources they need to challenge an unjust government and defeat its forces of repression. Outmanoeuvred by the compromises that soon stifled the mobilisations of July 1830, February 1848, and 1870-71, moreover, Blanqui came to be an exceptionally lucid analyst of the dynamics of collective protests, and of the techniques deployed by the state in order to contain them. Few people have been better placed than Blanqui to understand why and how popular movements succeed or fail.
 Anyone involved or interested in public protest has a great deal to learn both from Blanqui's insights and from his limitations. As activists involved in long-term campaigns around nuclear disarmament, animals rights or climate change will know, our established political systems are exceptionally good at absorbing challenges of all kinds. The perspective of a whole generation has been marked by the experience of the apparent impunity of power, whether exercised by financial institutions in Europe or by armies in the Middle East. In recent years, however, protests have shaken much of southern Europe, students from Qu&amp;eacute;bec to Chile have rebelled against the marketisation of education, and financial centres have been occupied and challenged in three continents. Indigenous movements across the Americas have acquired new force, and grassroots campaigns have acquired new means to question the boundaries of established nation states, and to reclaim urban spaces and common resources. Above all, and despite the recent violence in the region, the Arab Spring has left an impression that (to evoke Kant's late appreciation of the French Revolution) remains 'too momentous and too widespread in its influence for nations not to reminded of it when favourable circumstances present themselves.'
 Blanqui offers contemporary participants in and analysts of popular protest an invaluable set of conceptual resources for approaching questions of organisation, leadership, mobilisation and its many obstacles and pitfalls.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197635</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Peter Hallward, One-day workshop at the University of Helsinki</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>364E01B3-C24C-4D6B-AC86-363FEB540476</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'On Political Will: A Workshop with Peter Hallward'.

In the meantime, though, both our conference on Blanqui and our various workshops and presentations on the broader questions associated with political will and popular sovereignty have attracted a good deal of interest both among the general public (as demonstrated for instance by sell-out crowds for an LSE Forum event on 5 October 2016, and at an arts festival in Finland in August 2015, both listed in the 'Engagements' section) and in political activist circles, notably in the enthusiastic responses to a one-day workshop I gave in Melbourne, in July 2016, to a mixed audience of students, academics, and community activists. 

It is still too early for Blanqui's own work or its reception to make much of an impact beyond specialist academic circles, but we have done a good deal to prepare the ground for its wider dissemination, and to enable both casual engagement with and detailed study of his work. 

The broader questions relating to 'the will of the people', meanwhile, have become the stuff of newspaper headlines, in the UK and Europe and indeed in many other parts of the world; I hope that our second conference, devoted to precisely these topics, may strike a real chord, well beyond the confines of the academy. As with the Blanqui conference it will be free and open to the general public, and its sessions will be recorded and then posted online. I hope that together with the Blanqui Archive website and the publications that will soon result from the project, the conference will make a significant contribution to the unfolding political discussions (on the nature of popular and parliamentary sovereignty, on direct democracy, on populism and its limits, on attempts to 'take back control', on Brexit, on national independence, on the use and manipulation of referenda, etc.) which seem set to shape the immediate political future of both the UK and the US, and plenty of other places too.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>46A43F39-5DF5-44D3-AC41-37BE8E5E0397</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d47397056258.13595459</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Although our project's second international conference will not take place until June 2017, and two of its main outputs (an anthology and a monograph) will not appear in print until 2018 and 2019 respectively, I think the project has fully succeeded in achieving its original objectives and made a number of distinctive contributions to several related fields:

1. We selected, edited and translated the first substantial collection of Blanqui's political writings, and the resulting anthology will be published, with a preface and introduction, by Verso early in 2018. Most of the translations are already listed as open access texts on our project website, at https://blanqui.kingston.ac.uk/texts/. Although the translation work proved a little more challenging and time-consuming that initially envisaged, I think the final result should stand the test of time, and remain the standard Blanqui primary source in English for many years to come. At more than 130,000 words, it will be a substantial volume. Along with all of Blanqui's best-known texts, we also laboriously scoured his voluminous manuscript archive (comprising some 26 semi-legible volumes held by the French national library) and extracted an extensive set of 'Philosophical and Political Fragments', which together offer a relatively full sampling of his approach to a wide range of topics; the French version of this collection is posted at https://blanqui.kingston.ac.uk/texts/fragments-philosophiques-et-politiques-1840s-70s/, and the English translation will go up on the project website as soon as Verso releases the anthology. 

2. We have built the first website devoted to Blanqui's work and legacy, in any language: The Blanqui Archive, https://blanqui.kingston.ac.uk/. Along with his main texts (in both the original French and our new English translations), the site provides reproductions of all of Blanqui's published and posthumously published works, transcripts of the main court proceedings undertaken against him, and scans of the full set of his manuscripts held by the Biblioth&amp;egrave;que Nationale in Paris, along with a detailed chronology and a bibliography. It complements a selection of focused studies of Blanqui with a broad set of critical assessments of his legacy, extracted from writers positioned across the revolutionary spectrum. The site also hosts audio recordings from our conference on Blanqui (May 2016), and a collection of maps, portraits, photos and other pertinent images. This website should transform the study of Blanqui's work, and for the first time, enable researchers who don't have direct access to the libraries in Paris to engage in detail with his writings and his influence. I have already received a number of appreciative messages from colleagues in the UK, the US, and France, and hope that the site will help convert Blanqui from a notorious but seldom studied figure to a genuine point of reference in the study of nineteenth-century political thought, the history of revolutionary theory and practice, and in debates surrounding the legacies of the French Revolution, of the 'utopian socialisms' of the 1830s and 40s, of Marxism, of political violence, and of the relation between political and social change.

3. We organised the first international conference on Blanqui ever to be held in UK, and as far as I know, the first anywhere in the English-speaking world, at Kingston University, on 27 May 2016, with speakers from France, the US, and the UK. The conference was a great success, and although detailed engagement with Blanqui's work may only begin to spread more widely with the publication of our anthology and the texts gathered on our website, I think the conference greatly helped to set an agenda for this coming critical reception. Our second conference should build on this and expand the range of questions under consideration, with a broader discussion of the topic of political will in general; it is planned for 1st and 2nd June 2017, and I will include more details below).

4. The other main contribution that I hope we will make to this reception concerns the specific approach we adopted over the course of the project, namely the focus on questions of political will and volition - the nature and limits of voluntary commitment, free engagement, deliberation, purpose, and so on. Although it is dispersed across the fragments of his manuscripts, Blanqui offers a distinctive contribution to these long-standing philosophical and political questions, and I hope that my monograph on Blanqui and Political Will (contracted by Verso, due for publication in 2019) will help to assess it, and to situate it with respect to other and better-known points of reference, notably Rousseau, Robespierre, Marx, and Gramsci. In addition to working on this aspect of Blanqui's work, I devoted some of my research time to an ongoing study on the question of political will more broadly, which should be published by Verso around the same time, with the title 'The Will of the People.' I hope that these publications may make a contribution to some of the most important debates that still animate work in critical theory and contemporary political philosophy more generally, regarding the status and autonomy of the subject or actor, the limits of agency, the relation between conscious purpose and contextual constraints or 'underlying' tendencies -- in short, the immense question of the relation between freedom and necessity, as formulated by Rousseau and then adopted by Kant and the German Idealists (followed later by Marx and many of his readers) as perhaps the central question of philosophy itself.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Both our project website and the Blanqui anthology (complemented by our own critical assessments of his work and legacy) enable anglophone researchers and activists to engage properly with Blanqui for the first time. The material will be of interest to people working in several related but distinct disciplines, notably Politics, History, French Studies, and Philosophy. 

In the short term, I expect the most immediate interest will come from students and scholars interested in revolutionary theory and history, in Marxism and its relation to contemporary and alternative approaches to political action, in the analysis of popular movements, in the study of French political history and of the broad legacy of the French Revolution. 

Blanqui is already a fairly familiar point of reference among political activists in France, however (and has been championed in particular by the influential 'Comit&amp;eacute; Invisible' or Tiqqun group), and in a context of rising political tension it is quite possible that readings of Blanqui will be taken up, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, by a range of political actors concerned with political strategy, the organisation of social movements, the problems and dangers involved in recourse to political violence, and so on.

As for the broader work on political will and 'the will of the people', these topics have in a sense already become central to mainstream political debate in recent years, not least during the tumultuous year of the project itself, 2016. We will be pursuing some these broader questions in the project's second conference, organised (after some delays to accommodate our speakers' schedules) for 1st and 2nd June 2017, on the theme: 'The Will of the People? Revolutionary Legacies, Reactionary Manipulations'. The list of confirmed speakers includes: Gilbert Achcar (SOAS), Peter Hallward (Kingston), Lars Lih (McGill), Marisa Linton (Kingston), Karma Nabulsi (Oxford), Yves Sintomer (Paris VIII, Harvard), Jeffery Webber (Queen Mary), and Jessica Whyte (Western Sydney).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B3FE90EB-B864-4A83-A45E-E346ED934EB4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d473b4c06c74.15511244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://blanqui.kingston.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Blanqui Archive is the first substantial website to be devoted to Blanqui, in any language. It posts a comprehensive sampling of important texts, both in new English translations and in their original French, some of which have been transcribed and edited for the first time. It provides reproductions of all of Blanqui's published and posthumously published works, transcripts of the main court proceedings undertaken against him, and scans of the full set of his manuscripts held by the Biblioth&amp;egrave;que Nationale in Paris, along with a detailed chronology and a bibliography. It complements a selection of focused studies of Blanqui with a broad set of critical assessments of his legacy, extracted from writers positioned across the revolutionary spectrum. The site also hosts audio recordings from the first international conference on Blanqui to be held in UK (at Kingston University, in May 2016), and a collection of maps, portraits, photos and other pertinent images.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A7A0B2F-C57B-4D21-845B-2A099C98B36C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Blanqui Archive website will transform specialist research on Auguste Blanqui's own writings and legacy, and will make a valuable contribution to the wider study of nineteenth-century political history and thought.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6f90a8910c3.39644928</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The Blanqui Archive website</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://blanqui.kingston.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>386FEE4A-FF83-4874-86EF-E730C54BB3B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Un texte in&amp;eacute;dit de Blanqui - &amp;quot;Fatal, fatalisme, fatalit&amp;eacute;&amp;quot; '</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>P?riode</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7098f2d552a14221bd3e576859133078"><gtr:id>7098f2d552a14221bd3e576859133078</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Louis-Auguste Blanqui</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6f7b04e9ed0.83881434</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M009769/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
