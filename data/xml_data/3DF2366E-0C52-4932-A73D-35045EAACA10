Their potential to elucidate the timing and impacts of abrupt climate changes and millennial-scale climate variability prior to the Holocene has been little exploited, however. In a recent review of vegetation records of millennial-scale variability during the last glacial (73,500 - 14,700 calendar years ago, 73.4-14.7 ka BP), the paucity of records from North African Mediterranean borderlands was identified as a major limitation to the understanding of spatial variability in past climate dynamics associated with abrupt climate events evident in marine and ice core records (Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich variability). Research from the Alboran Sea raises several questions regarding the phasing of climate variability between the mountains of Northwest Africa and southwestern Europe, in particular regarding moisture availability during high-latitude cooling events, with important implications for the understanding of past air mass trajectories in the subtropics. New data are required to resolve the nature of the hydrological regime and the role of fire during abrupt climate events. This project will undertake high-resolution palaeoecological investigation of new deep-lake cores retrieved from Middle Atlas lakes. The coring mission, fully funded by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), is scheduled for September 2012. In this project, analysis of vegetation change and fire regime will be undertaken at centennial-scale resolution, supported by the development of a robust AMS radiocarbon chronological framework, in the framework of an international collaborative approach incorporating sedimentological, palaeolimnological, palaeohydrological and geochemical investigation. This project will advance the understanding of climate-vegetation-fire interactions in the Mediterranean region and the sensitivity of montane ecosystems to abrupt climate forcing. It will also contribute to the understanding of climate dynamics, notably air mass movements and hydrological regime, in the region of Atlantic-Mediterranean-Saharan climatological interaction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the research:
1. International conservation and ecosystem management 
Improved understanding of the long-term resilience and vulnerability of dryland mountain ecosystems is of key relevance to conservation and management efforts in North Africa and the Mediterranean region. A targeted beneficiary of the research is the IUCN-Med (International Union for Conservation of Nature - Mediterranean Commission). Through collaboration in the activities of the IUCN-Med, conservation and management practitioners will benefit from the exchange of knowledge, perspectives and expertise from the academic community.
2. UK-based geotourism
Geotourism is an important sector in the Moroccan and other Mediterranean economies. Several UK-based companies (e.g. Discover Ltd, Greentours, Naturetrek) run educational trekking and nature tours in the Atlas mountains. Issues of long-term environmental change and the sensitivity of montane vegetation and landscapes to rapid climatic change need to be incorporated within these tours. The principal investigator is in contact with one company (Discover Ltd) that organises walking holidays in Morocco (www.discover.ltd.uk) and hosts educational fieldcourses in Morocco. Engagement with the UK geotourism sector will enhance competiveness in the global tourism market.
3. UK public
Given current concern over climate change and habitat/biodiversity loss, the project will be of interest to the general public. In light of the polemical treatment of climate change in much of the media, there is a duty to convey in an accessible and engaging way the methods and findings of scientific projects investigating the impacts of past climatic changes. 
4. Education 
The aims and activities of scientists also need to be communicated to the educational sector in inspiring and informative ways. The Widening Participation activities of the University of Manchester provide avenues for engaging with local schools. Through the New Academics Programme at Manchester University, links have already been established between new members of staff and the Widening Participation programme, facilitating outreach activities in the Manchester area.

Impact milestones:

The glacier
Microscopes
Top trumps! Cormac Thomas
The mammoth drawing - Seth Thomas
Enjoyed drawing a mammoth with charcoal. I enjoyed drawing the pollen seeds - Eleanor ( Age 8)
I enjoyed the top trumps the best
The microscopes
James - making mammoth
Ailsa - using microscopes
 
-What do you know now that you didn't know before?
James - I know more about Ice age mammals
That charcoal even existed for drawing. That there are lots of different pollen in the world. There are triangle seeds with groves doen the side Eleanor (Age 8)
I didn't know the Woolly Rhino existed

The museum has invited me to undertake a similar activity session in January 2015. During the Manchester Science Week, we shared our activity to session to visitors from the Royal Society Public Engagement Launch Day, and received positive feedback from this group. Fostering strong links with the Manchester Museum is a key avenue for outreach and impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54633fe44b4175.86936647</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://events.manchester.ac.uk/event/event:r2o-hyr9opob-o61vg1/ice-age-science-mammoths-mega-boulders-and-microscopes</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dissemination article in International Innovation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D09679C5-03FC-42AF-BA71-71BCC4C22AAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2013 I worked with the a team from International Innovation, the leading global dissemination resource, to publish a dissemination article about the NERC project entitled &amp;quot;Digging Deep&amp;quot; with the sub-title &amp;quot;Engaged in a project of longstanding and far-reaching relevance, Dr William Fletcher reveals his diverse passions in the field of Physical Geography and discusses his current research into the prehistoric impacts of abrupt climate change in the Middle Atlas region of Morocco&amp;quot;.

However, key steps have been taken in line with proposed Pathways to Impact, notably in terms of achieving membership of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management, disseminating information about the project via publication in the foremost global dissemination resource (International Innovation), engaging with the local to regional public via activity sessions organised as part of Manchester Science Festival at the Manchester Museum, and working with a local artist to create sculptures for educational activities such as the Science Festival. The activities at the Manchester Museum were very well received by the public and the Museum has invited further activity sessions in 2015. The NERC award can be understood to have planted the seeds of an impact case relating to public engagement in research and enrichment of cultural life in the Manchester area. Efforts to sustain and develop this case will be actively pursued over the next 1-3 years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AA7FC394-582B-4803-A31A-3ADD770D9617</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463f97c0e9818.81890259</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through this NERC New Investigator Award, my research has provided new insights into the ecological impacts of past rapid climate change events in the Middle Atlas, Morocco. Successful recovery of new, high-quality, deep-lake sediment cores spanning the last 25,000 years from the Middle Atlas in the framework of a co-funded NERC and DFG (German Science Foundation) underpins the findings. Specifically, by significantly enhancing temporal resolution of the new palaeoecological records, my research has provided the first evidence of impacts of early Holocene climate anomalies, such as the North Atlantic cooling episodes at 8200 and 10300 years ago, on terrestrial ecosystems and fire regime in Northwest Africa on sub-centennial timescales. Compared with previous research in this geographical and thematic context, the research has taken robust steps to improve chronological uncertainties about the timing of key events. In particular, this necessitated the novel application of AMS radiocarbon dating to pollen concentrates from lake sediments. This approach has been possible through cooperation with the NERC Radiocarbon Facility at East Kilbride, and three Radiocarbon Dating Awards. The research provides critical insights into the climatic sensitivity and resilience of the emblematic Atlantic cedar (Cedrus atlantica) forests of the Middle Atlas, with important consequences for the understanding of this species' fragility in the face of current global change. 
The New Investigator Award has cemented a multilateral international partnership between the Universities of Manchester, Leipzig and Potsdam, as well as collaborations with Moroccan scientists. The findings of the research have been communicated at five international conferences in 2013-2014 including both interdisciplinary congresses and specialist meetings in the USA, Europe and Africa. Two manuscripts in advanced stages of development will lead to the first publication of the findings (submission, January 2015). The research has enabled the PI to establish an active research group at Manchester including two funded PhD students.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the research will be of value to the wide multidisciplinary academic community engaged in the study of palaeoclimates and palaeoenvironments. Specifically, the findings relating to rapid climate events during the early Holocene will be of value to forthcoming climate modelling efforts to understand the nature, scale, spatial patterns and drivers of change for these events. Links with the climate modelling community engaged in this activity have been successfully made, for example through participation in the INTIMATE EU COST Action. 
The novel application of pollen concentrate dating has received significant interest following the conference presentations, and the method will be put to use by other researchers, particularly working in dryland and mountain environments where traditional methods may not be applicable.
Beyond academia, the information on long-term vegetation history and sensitivity to climate changes will be of value to present-day ecologists and of significance for informing conservation and management practice of cedar forests in the Atlas region. Steps have been taken to facilitate the transfer of knowledge in this direction, specifically by establishing a partnership with the ecology unit at Moulay-Ismail University (Meknes) and membership of the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management (Mediterranean Ecosystems).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E6BCBBEE-2BA1-408C-9846-068C6B8882A7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546402de4a8a63.53564126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE25A63C-D108-4795-B024-8330824662F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Environmental Drivers of Holocene Forest Development in the Middle Atlas, Morocco</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ecc5e993c674c00c1809f57cc3439b36"><gtr:id>ecc5e993c674c00c1809f57cc3439b36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Campbell J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc799a571d6.20864655</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>78AFE434-113F-4AEC-81EE-27734DE3B6B9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Millennial-scale fluctuations in Saharan dust supply across the decline of the African Humid Period</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaternary Science Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/562612670d62ec777102ac89a0236d06"><gtr:id>562612670d62ec777102ac89a0236d06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zielhofer C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc67140b923.17089756</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F8E6EA86-4978-4E50-AFBD-D273448935FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>AMS radiocarbon dating of pollen concentrates in a karstic lake system</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaternary Geochronology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/730bec604a7085bb01d02bd00dfe3dbd"><gtr:id>730bec604a7085bb01d02bd00dfe3dbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fletcher W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58af1bb4b31472.36638429</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D26F088-8C6F-491B-8497-CE8170F22E59</gtr:id><gtr:title>Atlantic forcing of Western Mediterranean winter rain minima during the last 12,000 years</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaternary Science Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/562612670d62ec777102ac89a0236d06"><gtr:id>562612670d62ec777102ac89a0236d06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zielhofer C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58af1c7ce5be50.65926852</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K000608/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
