It brings central debates within the academic literature to bear upon key policy discussions regarding economic management and regulation, welfare, work, and democratic political participation. The central premise underpinning the series is that the post-2007/8 crisis, and the policy responses witnessed to it, have the potential to unsettle the way in which citizens relate to each other and the state across a range of political economy issue areas. It seeks to outline and assess both current and alternative models of economic regulation, welfare, work, and democratic engagement in order to identify the potential for improvement in each of these areas and the political circumstances that might enable these advances to be achieved. It brings together academic scholars and members of the policy community to engage in a dialogue that goes beyond internal scholarly discussions and has the potential to inform policy outcomes that will have clear economic and political benefits.

The crisis was arguably caused by a failure of economic regulation. Initial government responses prompted questions surrounding whether we were witnessing a new, more interventionist form of state activity, especially in the areas of monetary and fiscal policy. These initial developments have subsequently given way to a move in most developed countries to a programme of welfare retrenchment. The crisis has also witnessed sustained and historically high levels of unemployment and an increase in part-time and fixed-term patterns of employment. Finally, each of these developments has been met by a range of novel and growing forms of political participation and protest. These occurrences are of central concern to political economy and its core focus on the political and social conditions under which economic and welfare policy settlements are formed. This therefore demands an engagement between the academic discipline of political economy and the concrete political economy outcomes that have occurred since 2007. This moreover needs to occur in a way that avoids academic insularity through a dialogue between the scholarly community and policy community. This seminar series therefore attempts to achieve this aim, bringing together academic experts, policymakers, and members of civil society to consider and assess current and alternative policy programmes and the conditions under which they are implemented and/or pursued.

The seminar series is divided into four substantive political economy themes, focusing on models of economic regulation, welfare, work, and democracy. It brings together individuals from think tanks, civil society organisations, media, government, civil service and campaign groups, in dialogue with high-profile academics, to consider both current and alternative policy options in each of the substantive areas. It therefore has the potential to advance efforts to improve economic and financial regulation, to balance reductions in public expenditure with the sustained provision of quality public services, and to consider the factors influencing the quality and quantity of employment, alongside an analysis of the democratic pressures for change that have emerged in each of these policy areas.

Each of the seminars includes members of the policy community including individuals in government, business, trade unions, think tanks, civil society, and campaign groups. The final seminar, moreover, will be hosted by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS), a leading Brussels-based think-tank closely embedded within the Brussels policy community and with strong contacts with political actors across the member states of the European Union. This will provide a unique opportunity to facilitate direct contact and dialogue between the Investigators and key members of the policy community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This seminar series will explore changes that have occurred to economic management regulation, welfare, work, and democracy in light of the post-2007 global economic crisis. As such, it relates to issues that have an impact upon the daily lives of all citizens and feature on a daily basis in media stories, reports and debates, and has the potential to benefit policymakers, elected political representatives and civil society actors as well as the general public.

One of the key aims of the seminar series will be to consider and assess current and alternative political economy outcomes. The focus is on economic management, welfare, work, and democracy. This therefore has clear potential to contribute to the political and socio-economic well-being and economic performance of the United Kingdom. Indeed, one of the central aims of the seminar series is to identify opportunities through which scholarly research, in dialogue with a broad range of members of the policy community, can inform the design and implementation of improved outcomes in each of the four areas of investigation.

The research presented will therefore be valuable to a range of non-academic audiences:

1. Policymakers, political parties and elected political representatives.
There exists an ongoing, lively and high profile policy debate in the areas of economic management, welfare, work, and democracy. Each of these have obviously increased in prominence and importance as a result of the crisis, with the policymakers increasingly seeking to design economic regulation models that are able to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis; to achieve fiscal health through a reduction in public expenditure, in combination with the sustained provision of quality public services; to tackle historically high levels of unemployment; and to engage with a range of novel forms of political participation that have arisen largely in response to the introduction of reduced spending on public services. In making a significant contribution to each of these issue areas, it is therefore anticipated that the seminar series will be of clear benefit to policymakers, political parties and elected political representatives. These types of individuals and organisations will be engaged through both direct involvement (Robert Porteous, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS); Claudio Borio, BIS; and the participants of the final seminar) and as set out in the Pathways to Impact.

2. Civil society and campaign organisations.
Whilst policy discussions amongst policymakers tend to consider the feasibility and functionality of policy alternatives, pressures for social change are also associated with the advocacy work of civil society and campaign organisations. For this reason, the findings and discussions of the seminar series will be closely focused on engaging with a range of such actors. These groups will benefit from the research of the seminars which will provide insight into the extent to which different policy models are possible, how they might be achieved, and the degree to which political and social obstacles and opportunities inhibit and/or engender such outcomes. These groups will be engaged as outlined in the Pathways to Impact and through the direct involvement of trade unions (Nicola Smith, TUC), think tanks (Ann Pettifor, New Economics Foundation), and civil society campaign groups (Ada Colau, Citizen's platform against housing evictions in Spain).

3. The general public.
Given the highly topical nature of the series and the way in which its subject matter impacts upon the daily lives of all citizens, the series will have clear benefit for the general public, who have an obvious interest in attempts to improve outcomes in each of the four policy areas under investigation. Furthermore, as a result of the strong media element of the series engagement strategy, it is anticipated that public awareness and debate on each of the issues will be enhanced.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30301</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public seminar, University of Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69798CDA-8680-4CDB-86D7-B162DC50969A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the kick-off event for the seminar series 'The Political Economy of the post-crisis landscape: assessing change in economic management, welfare, work and democracy'.

The seminar was based in a leading Brussels-based think-tank, providing an excellent opportunity to facilitate further discussion between policy-focused and academic-focused actors from across the European Union. It will identify common concerns, likely trajectories, and the potential for constructive academic/policy-sphere collaboration over future political economy alternatives - in terms of regulation, welfare, work, and democracy. Given the impact that the recent referendum result on British membership in the European Union had upon the themes that the seminar had focused on, the discussion focused on how this would impact upon the trends that had been discussed in each of the seminars.

Participants included academics from across Europe, an MEP who is a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a Senior Researcher for the European Trade Union Institute, a Senior Researcher from FEPS, the host organisation, with members of the audience from the German and Dutch Trade Ministries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1e4f004b6a9.75559264</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/government-society/departments/political-science-international-studies/events/2014-16-esrc-seminar-series/2016-11-10-brexit.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Seminar (City University, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BF03BD80-1603-4355-86EF-4AE0CC23A3C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was focused on one of the four areas of the seminar series - 'Funding in the Post-Crisis Economy: Lessons from the Crisis'.

The workshop theme, which focused upon the necessity of the welfare state for social reproduction, is outlined below:

After Mario Draghi announced ECB's Outright Monetary Transaction Programme in September 2012, bond-yield spreads narrowed in the Eurozone and put an end to the immediacy of the Eurozone crisis in the sense that the common currency was stabilised. Yet, Europe's crisis is not over. Contestation over the 'politics of austerity' continues to raise questions over the legitimacy of orthodox models of economic policy. Such questions and contestation intersect in complex ways with moral panics such as that of Europe's 'refugee crisis'. The attendant political manifestations are complex and varied. They include territorialisation of political cleavages (the question of a possible 'Brexit' and the increased appeal of separatist movements in, for instance, Scotland and Catalunya); the rise of the populist nationalist right; the decline, and in some cases outright collapse, of social democracy and recomposition of the Left giving rise to parties such as Syriza and Podemos. Negotiations over the Greek debt raised profound questions about the politics of representation in the Eurozone with some suggesting that Europe is moving towards an increasingly authoritarian form of neoliberalism.
This workshop will explore the extent to which a basic function that hitherto has been assigned to the welfare state - the function of social reproduction - can serve as an analytical site to explore the interconnections between these seemingly complex, intersecting and multiple dimensions of European crisis.
The workshop, then, proposes to return to what classical welfare state research considered to be an essential structural property of the welfare state (Wilensky, 1975; Therborn, 1987). The basic argument is that, as (post-) industrial capitalism develops, 'traditional' communal and extended family reproductive networks are undermined and need to be replaced by public welfare provision. This insight was subsequently given further breadth, depth, ontological subtlety, and a more critical edge by feminist research (e.g. Pateman, 1988; Orloff, 1996). Here questions were raised over the extent to which the welfare state overcame traditional patriarchal structures and the extent to which it instead mediated between, and helped co-constitute, different forms of stratification in the realms of the family, market and the state. Nevertheless, the emancipatory potential of the welfare state continued to be explored (e.g. Sainsbury, 1996).
From such analytical considerations, deeper issues about the (post?) crisis landscape in Europe can be explored. It can reasonably be argued that social policy developments in Europe in the two decades leading up to the crisis were indeed about addressing reproductive requirements generated by a modernisation agenda and attempting to mainstream feminist critiques of the 'male-breadwinner model' with the neo-liberal economic flexibility agenda. Crucial in this regard was the image of an 'adult worker model' (Giuliani and Lewis, 2005). Increased social expenditure in southern Europe was above all in traditional reproductive areas in a rather narrow sense, such as childcare provision (Rhodes, 2002: 312-13). The concern of the Lisbon Agenda with increased labour market participation rates was intimately intertwined with the reproductive question of a prospective transition to the 'adult worker' model.
From such a perspective, a central working-hypothesis for the workshop to address would be as follows: 
Attempts to retrench social policy through austerity are interfering with structural reproductive necessities, and are likely to continue to generate profound crisis tendencies. Prima facie evidence for its plausibility can be found in the dramatic increase of suicides, infectious diseases and HIV (Karanikolos et al, 2013; Bergiannaki and Dimitrakopoulos, 2014) and the increased strains of the attenuated extended family networks in southern Europe as families move back home to retired parents and grand-parents in order to economically manage (e.g. Salido, Carabana &amp;amp; Torrejon, 2012). These manifestations and strains condition the political reactions to migration, which, however, also plays a critical role in Europe's political economy of reproduction
The workshop proposes to explore this hypothesis with reference to the following questions:
? Does research affirm that there is a reproductive dimension to the 'post'-crisis landscape?
? How does state-of-the-art research address the question of reproductive crisis, and is it adequate?
? How should the emergent properties of the reproductive crisis be conceptualised?
? What are the implications of the answers to the aforementioned for the merit of current modes of crisis management and alternatives to these?

It was hosted by the Work, Organisation and Employment Relations Research Centre (WOERRC) at the University of Sheffield. The aims of the seminar are described below:

The economies of the European Union continue to be affected by the aftermath of the financial crisis that began in 2007/8. In many countries unemployment remains above its pre-crisis level and economic growth is weak. The search for a solution to sluggish economic performance and persistently high unemployment has led European governments to implement labour market reforms, many of which have involved a weakening of employment protection legislation (EPL) and looser constraints on the use of temporary employment contracts. Casual forms of employment have proliferated. The coverage and enforcement of employment rights have also been affected. Austerity has resulted in some labour inspectorates experiencing budget cuts, encouraging a tighter focusing of enforcement activity and potential a narrowing of the effective coverage of regulation, yet the simultaneous growth of casualization, informality and more complex supply chains imply a need for the scope of regulation to be expanded. How might this be achieved?
The aim of this seminar is to take stock of post-crisis developments in labour regulation, focusing on the UK and the wider EU. The seminar will discuss labour legislation, the relative legal status of regular, temporary and informal workers, and changes affecting enforcement mechanisms. The issues that the seminar will address include: 
? How have regulatory challenges changed since the crisis? What are the new challenges?
? How have changes in employment legislation and its enforcement altered labour market outcomes and conditions of work? Has weaker EPL improved the position of labour market 'outsiders'?
? How might employment protections be better designed and enforced? Where are the regulatory pressure points and who should apply the pressure? What role should government agencies, employers, unions and NGOs play? 
? Can contractual flexibility and employment security be simultaneously achieved? 
? What are the drivers of post-crisis regulatory change? 
? What roles do ideas, interests, power and economics play in the development of regulation?

As explained in the objectives of the seminar series, it was not a research project designed to produce 'key findings', rather, as with all good seminar series, it was designed to encourage collaboration, debate, engagement, the production of new networks and the breaking down of thinking within theoretical and topic based silos. The seminars were successful in bringing together representatives from academia, think tanks, civil society, media, government, civil service and campaign groups, in stimulating dialogue and challenging fragmented perspectives (see Engagement Activities for details and links). The seminars engaged early career researchers (ECRs) from each of the host institutions, providing a platform for their work to be presented and discussed, and a doctoral research student from the University of Birmingham participated in the whole series. Networks have been developed between academics, policy practitioners and civil society resulting in a number of outputs either published or under review which develop themes addressed in one or more of the seminars (see Publications). While some of the findings were specific to the particular seminar topic where they were discussed, and hence are best represented in individual papers, as we anticipated in the design of the series, frameworks have emerged which allow the linkages between the policy areas to be made more clearly. A special issue of Comparative European Politics, titled &amp;nbsp;'Contention in the age of austerity in Europe: the emergence of new alternatives?' and co-edited by the main CI, was developed alongside the themes of the series and launched at the concluding seminar in Brussels. A book, co-edited by another CI and developed alongside the seminar series, addresses the multi-disciplinary issues facing the European Union within Global Capitalism. The early stage of a new framework to demonstrate the historical and theoretical interrelationships between the policy areas of the series was produced by the PI and main CI. The final seminar used this framework as a point of departure and it continues to be developed for both academic, policy and public audiences.
Beyond the seminars, ongoing engagement with a wider audience was stimulated through the use of a series Twitter feed complemented by the feeds of the participating research institutes, a series website presenting the themes and key discussions at each seminar and links to video and audio of seminars using a YouTube channel. More popular engagement was through a piece written for the Conversation website, subsequently picked up on by The Guardian and The Times newspapers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The integrating framework trialled at the concluding seminar has been made publicly available through the Prezi site and several contributors to that seminar have expressed their intention to use it for teaching and other explanatory purposes. The authors are currently developing this for journal publication, policy and public audiences. &amp;nbsp;
Several journal articles, a special issue and an edited book have been published by the PI and CIs of the series, stimulated by its topics and discussions (see Publications). Two further journal articles are currently under review. These will ensure further academic engagement with the themes of the seminar series. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The final seminar resulted in an invitation from the representative of the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) to develop a joint research project based on the integration of the policy areas of the series.
The Conversation piece which was written following one of the seminars was picked up by The Guardian and The Times encouraging further public engagement.
The main findings from each seminar along with the audio-visual of selected presentations will continue to be publicly available through the series website and its Youtube channel, promoted via Twitter feeds of the series and participating research institutes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6E7217D3-F100-496F-BF4F-72AE06D7B2DB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cee4bd245145.18919468</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/government-society/departments/political-science-international-studies/events/2014-16-esrc-seminar-series/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3CF29A7B-432B-4A72-909E-E2EAD9A98016</gtr:id><gtr:title>Challenging the age of austerity: Disruptive agency after the global economic crisis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Comparative European Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f5862363c7d045c5baa296087fb3811c"><gtr:id>f5862363c7d045c5baa296087fb3811c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bailey D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a1df643eba71.05033232</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>73462332-4042-4745-BC06-BB0D8FD7E5BF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disrupting the European Crisis: A Critical Political Economy of Contestation, Subversion and Escape</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Political Economy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/859bcfcf96a648ec4614ad000710e0cc"><gtr:id>859bcfcf96a648ec4614ad000710e0cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Huke N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1356-3467</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56cedaf60566f2.58712755</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D7A3CF3E-0594-420B-A0EE-AD6B17D6AAD7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Welfare Capitalism and &amp;quot;Post-Industrialism&amp;quot;: A Critique of the New Malthusians</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8aa9a18ee76884afb1df05b7540941dc"><gtr:id>8aa9a18ee76884afb1df05b7540941dc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lewis, P.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58b30d1b4fff83.25500586</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DA8454C8-6EB5-41BA-85DE-E322C6F9FA09</gtr:id><gtr:title>Welfare Capitalism in Post-Industrial Times: Trilemma or Power Over Rents?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Political Economy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d3dddbe4c57e30c945f3277e6c8e3113"><gtr:id>d3dddbe4c57e30c945f3277e6c8e3113</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lewis P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcafb749628.76370931</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0594B3D-6AFB-4E02-A3E0-597815AAD59B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Europe's Radical Left: From Marginality to the Mainstream?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a31aff5366af9afa09e9c8676e7a581b"><gtr:id>a31aff5366af9afa09e9c8676e7a581b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bailey DJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a5966c08b7a1.47096829</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0AECFEDF-DD87-48B5-B010-949ADB833018</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hard Evidence: this is the Age of Dissent -
