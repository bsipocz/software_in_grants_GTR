which could then be used to understand the dynamics of our planet, including the generation of the 

Earth's magnetic field which shield us from the deadly solar wind, mantle convection and plate tectonics which are eventually responsible for earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

The Earth's core is mainly made by iron, and as it happens the very interior of the core is solid, surrounded by a shell of liquid iron which extends roughly half way up towards the surface of the planet.

To measure the temperature of the core directly has been impossible to date, and it is likely to remain impossible in the foreseeable future. However, one possible strategy to constrain the core temperature

Quantum Monte Carlo techniques are various order of magnitudes more expensive than DFT, and for this reason have been essentially out of reach of computers for many problems. The arrival of HECToR at the end of 2008 has been the ideal opportunity to apply QMC to a &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot; problem. 

In a paper published in Physical Review Letters we reported our finding of the QMC melting point of pure iron at Earth's core conditions of ~6900 K.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EDC0FA44-F817-475D-8854-5AB4EDEA3A6F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4627189575.347295776bf9e2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0C1E26E1-CEF8-4733-9178-D10AD9E6C20E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Melting of iron under Earth's core conditions from diffusion Monte Carlo free energy calculations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7a2f48de858b49d05d4bd47e8ba2ff97"><gtr:id>7a2f48de858b49d05d4bd47e8ba2ff97</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sola E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d052052bd1611f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E794468B-97DA-42FF-BAD6-881EFE025B14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Equation of state of hexagonal closed packed iron under Earth's core conditions from quantum Monte Carlo calculations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7a2f48de858b49d05d4bd47e8ba2ff97"><gtr:id>7a2f48de858b49d05d4bd47e8ba2ff97</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sola E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d04e04e70b5f34</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F048750/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A2FF150-B3DF-4C8F-A44C-1EBF60BAFC60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Condensed Matter Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EAAD5EA-2E54-4986-942F-2E204958FE29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>High Performance Computing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
