In modern domestic and industrial environments it is usually regarded as a nuisance or hazard responsible for electrostatic shocks, process problems and industrial fires. This research aims to concentrate on its potentially positive uses and benefits. \n\nThe proposed pilot 'E-Static Shadows' is a practice-based experimental research project which intends to creatively explore the speculative and poetic potential of static electricity surrounding our everyday interactions. The aim of the project is to investigate how electrostatic energy could be utilised to play a part in the development of responsive and interactive textile systems. This project will study the possible translations of electrostatic energy into other types of energy such as light and sound using specially engineered intelligent textile systems as mediators and displays. This will be achieved by rendering electronic textiles capable of detecting, translating and displaying electrostatic fields into dynamic audio-visual patterns. \n\nThe focus of the proposed project will be held on the synthesis between the creative approach to textile practice and technical innovations in electronics, soft circuitry and materials. It will research how electrostatic can be used within this context. New design scenarios will be created that actively respond to electrostatic fields generated by human interactions. The research will create new synergies and investigate new ways of addressing static electricity dealing with issues across the fields of art, design, craft, sound, biology, technology and material science.\n\nThe underlining intention is to research how the easily accessible but little utilised phenomena of electrostatic can add to our sensory experiences drawing on interactive design concepts. One aim is to generate a deeper understanding of the field. This will be achieved through an interpretation of the charges into human sensorial modalities - vision and hearing. Ideally, these translations embedded in the soft medium of cloth shall provoke a higher awareness of the potential of electrostatic fields surrounding our habitat and initiate playful interactions between the viewer and the space. It is anticipated that this will provide opportunities for new speculations regarding the role of static electricity within a built environment.\n\nElectrostatic energy is essentially inexhaustible and regenerative energy. Therefore, to some extent, this project will also explore the potential of electrostatic energy as a certain type of renewable energy that can easily be generated virtually when and where desired. Eventually this interrogation could lead to novel uses of this energy not only in an interactive art and design context but it will also contribute to the knowledge of electrostatics in relation to technologies.\n\nThe outcome of the project will be a series of experiments and prototypes, informed by the research that will show in what ways electrostatic can be used to play an important part in the construction of interactive environment scenarios. As a part of the project it is intended to develop an installation made of textile displays using LEDs, soft circuitry, and industrial transistors. In response to the amount and intensity of the electrostatic energy exposed to the sensory textile membrane, the installation will be able to create a series of responsive transient audio-visual displays. \n\nThe prototypes will be exhibited at the Science Museum's Dana Centre for public dissemination. The documentation of research findings and critical analysis will be incorporated into articles and conference papers. This will be of interest to a wide range of scholars and practitioners working in the fields of intelligent textile, product and environmental design, architecture and electrostatic as well as those interested in the debates around cross-disciplinary research and science &amp;amp; art collaborations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E002625/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>287497FB-DD4A-44CC-AC13-DBAFADC9AD82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A6348FE-CF33-4F09-B4DA-BA731821F803</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Product Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
