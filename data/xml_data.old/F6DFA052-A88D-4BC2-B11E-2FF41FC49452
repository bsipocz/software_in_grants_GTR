This research has led to intergenerational mobility becoming the key goal of the UK government's social policy strategy. This project will achieve a step advance in our understanding of intergenerational economic mobility in the UK and will be of substantial benefit to policy makers in government as it seeks to improve equality of opportunity in Britain. We therefore would expect the work to be of significant interest to the newly established Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission. We would also anticipate communicating our findings to officials at the DWP, Treasury and Cabinet Office and with contacts in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister who has a strong interest in this area. The findings would also be of considerable interest to non-government organizations such as the Sutton Trust, the Social Mobility Foundation and the Intergenerational Foundation. 

We will stage a major conference toward the end of the project to address a broad audience. This will be in London and we will seek to invite other major researchers on family structure, poverty and children's life chances from the UK and abroad. This will provide a key opportunity both for influencing policy makers and getting the research out into the public domain. Attendance will be drawn from the Commission, Cabinet Office, government departments and a range on non-government organisations with interests in mobility and the impact of poverty on life chances. This will include the Sutton Trust, Child Poverty Action Group and Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

Social Policy at Bath and the Centre for Market and Public Organisation at Bristol (where Gregg and Macmillan are associates) have outstanding reputations for high quality research, dissemination and for fostering wider impact. Recognition of the impact of research work at Bath on policy and practice is evidenced by its recent award of the prestigious Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher and Further Education. The award to Bath cited our ''Influential research into child poverty and support for vulnerable people'. This specifically includes our research on children and poverty. The University has recently received funding from RCUK under their Public Engagement with Research Catalysts call. We are in the process of establishing a new Public Engagement Unit, and one of the elements of our programme of work is specifically focused on 'public engagement with policy makers'. In addition the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences has appointed a 'research ambassador' with the remit to promote suck links. This project will work closely with and benefit from these initiatives.

This project will exploit Gregg's extensive links to, and experience of working with, policy makers and practitioners to ensure impact (see also the pathways to impact and CVs attached). In addition, we will aim to exploit links made by Macmillan's placement as a Policy Analyst in the Cabinet Office Implementation Unit over the summer. Both have proven experience in engaging with different audiences, producing articles for the ESRCs 'Britain in....' series and 'Society Now' magazine. We will aim to contribute further articles to these publications and produce articles for CMPOs 'Research in Public Policy' bulletin which is sent to a wide-range of practitioners. A project website will be developed and maintained by our administrative appointment that will contain updates on findings, blog posts and podcasts on matters of wide interest.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>203419</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar Antwerp</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97D07C64-949F-4979-B7C1-4093ACEE6160</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar presentation to Postgraduate students at University of Antwerp - 24 april 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7dfcf382e7.49108770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation  Conference on Intergenerational mobility</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A257D55-99A4-4526-BFA4-DA61CC3C6F61</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation by Lindsey MACMILLAN TO WORKSHOP AIMED AT POLICY MAKERS AND CHARITIES/THINK TANKS IN THE AREA</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd796ca609f2.67932739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/casp/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation All Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>201A6FBA-8849-4070-9333-1A9BF1B9A733</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of Research on Life time intergenerational mobility to All Parliamentary group on social mobility.

Yet the UK literature is still in its infancy. This project made three new contributions to the literature:

The first provided the first estimate of lifetime economic mobility for the UK. Previous estimates of intergenerational mobility were based on point in time measures of income and earnings that suffer from life cycle and attenuation bias. We dealt with both of these issues and, in a more novel approach, showed the importance of sample selection driven by spells out of work. Our best estimate of lifetime intergenerational economic persistence in the UK is 0.43 for children born in 1970. Whilst we argue that this is the best available estimate to date, we discuss why there is good reason to believe that this is still a lower bound, owing to residual attenuation bias. This places the UK as one of the worst performing developed countries for social mobility.

The second key advance considers the returns to parental income and education across the distribution of son's earnings for the first time in the UK. While studies of intergenerational income mobility have typically focused at on estimating persistence across generations on average, policy makers are particularly interested in the life chances of poor children or who gets access to high paying, high status jobs. We find a J-shaped relationship between parental income and sons' earnings, with parental income a particularly strong predictor of labour market success for those at the bottom, and to a greater extent, the top of the earnings distribution. We explore the potential role of early skills, education and early labour market attachment in this process. Worryingly, we find that education is not as meritocratic as we might hope, with the return to coming from a wealthy family dominating that of a high level of education at the top of the distribution of earnings. Early periods as NEET have long-lasting impacts on those at the bottom, alongside parental income. 

The third contribution explores how attaining a university degree, as well as which university attended and degree subject, acts as meritocratic gateway into top professions and later labour market earnings. This paper draws together established and new evidence about the contribution that higher education can make to social mobility across the life course. While young people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to go to university than their richer peers, even amongst the selected group who do go to university, they are less likely to attend the highest status institutions, less likely to graduate and less likely to achieve the highest degree classes. These differences contribute to lower earnings of graduates from poorer families, but the earnings differentials go beyond these differences in degree achievement. Thus, while much of the policy emphasis to date has focused on widening access to university, our research highlights that the need to go well beyond the first day of university, to open access to top jobs for high educational achievers from less affluent families. 

These findings fit fully with the objectives of the grant. We look at progress of individuals within generations in terms of the links between their education experiences, access to top professions and later labour market earnings, combining this with advancements in the literature on income mobility across generations. The first and third paper have revise and resubmits at high quality economics journals, the Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics and the Oxford Review of Economic Policy. The second paper has been submitted to the Journal of Population Economics. Throughout the project, the findings have been transmitted to policy makers through engagement routes such as the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility and evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Social Mobility. We have also presented the findings to the Social Mobility Commission and at a number of other academic conferences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Fed into Commission on Social mobility and to key decision makers</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>293E346B-F2A9-4CC7-851F-F77940909A71</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd80c795f5d2.75383646</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>member of Commission on Social miobility and Child Poverty</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B39049FE-9E99-44F4-8292-F214AA1382A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gregg is commissioner on Commission on Social Mobility and Child Poverty - research feeds into commission annual report and major conference aimed at policy makers.
