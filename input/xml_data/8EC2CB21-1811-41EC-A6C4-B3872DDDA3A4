This will be done by fine-tuning current product formulations by engineering the technological parameters of realistic food models specific to each product and by applying state of the art technologies such as cryo-crystallisation, multiple emulsions and multi-layered processes in a manner never done before. In parallel, micro- and macro-structures of the new food matrices will be studied. To ensure the sensorial feasibility of this re-engineering, sensorial analysis and optimisation to ensure consumer acceptability will be carried out in parallel to these technological developments. Moreover, the nutritional value of reformulated foods will be estimated compared to the non reformulated original foods. Beside technological aspects, more fundamental studies from selected models developed above will be conducted to improve the understanding of the main mechanisms leading to perception. IFR will lead workpackage 4, which aims to use multiple emulsions to reduce the fat content in sauces and dressings, and will apply the approach to processed emat products in worckpackage 2. The findings will be transferred to the reformulation actions so that they can be introduced into the new food processes. These new product formulations will be validated via extensive consumer testing and demonstration activities with 9 SMEs for 6 European countries to ensure the industrial feasibility and consumer acceptance in different EU cultures and industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60319</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings are currently being utilised by participating companies to develop methods to reduce the fat content of a range of products for consumer testing.
We are also developing a BBSRC DRINC application to use this approach to reduce salt content in foods.
There may also be opportunities in the pharmaceutical sector to develop novel delivery forms.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EFCCFE09-1EBB-4497-AB45-9C38317586C7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464a2fa4ab747.30494655</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main outputs of this project were to develop stable, acceptable multiple emulsions in order to achieve significant reductions in fat content in a range of food products. 
We developed a range of protocols for different emulsion formulations for different product types. The main issue was the requirement to use polyglycerol polyricinoleate to stabilise the emulsions, which has restricted usage in foods.
We developed a novel method to improve the stability of the emulsions using in situ calcium induced gelation of alginate to produce very fine water in oil droplets. These approaches are currently being incorporated into real foods by participating SMEs</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Industry is very keen to take forward these results to develop new, healthier foods with reduced fat content, but with high sensory quality.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49132C62-205C-426D-8577-1F9ABB03FEC9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464a277f1e148.59612452</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4847CB0D-751E-48AD-B70A-FE2CB1031AF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparative study of the stability of multiple emulsions containing a gelled or aqueous internal phase</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food Hydrocolloids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/36701617edb96adc6f2c76349795bd4a"><gtr:id>36701617edb96adc6f2c76349795bd4a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perez-Moral N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545c9557e68940.50713728</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00042640</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
