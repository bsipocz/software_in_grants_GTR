Mathematical models play an essential role in modern life sciences research. They provide a way to test and develop hypotheses, infer details that cannot be measured experimentally, and identify where we lack understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing a given biological process. Systems biology uses modelling to study how the interactions between biological entities give rise to the function and behaviour of the overall biological system (or sub-system). These systems may be of many different scales, such as groups of interacting biomolecules (e.g. proteins or genes), cells or organisms. 

By representing our current beliefs and assumptions about a biological system in mathematical form, we can test whether the behaviour of the model (e.g. simulations of dynamic behaviour) recreates what we observe experimentally. However, any model is an abstract and simplified representation of the real system; for modelling results to be useful and increase our biological understanding, it is crucial to understand the uncertainty associated with any conclusions and predictions.

This research will develop methods to address two key needs in systems biology research: i) assessing the true uncertainty associated with modelling conclusions, and ii) using experimental data collected using high-throughput techniques to inform detailed models of intracellular processes. These methods will be applied to two biological systems as examples: i) the mechanisms ensuring correct development of the spinal cord during embryo growth, and ii) protein signalling pathways that allow cells to sense and respond to their environment. This work aims to provide novel insights into these specific biological systems, while developing methods that can be broadly applied to address other biomedical research questions using mathematical models. 

This proposal will extend and adapt my previous work developing a method to test how uncertainty about the exact structure of a biological system impacts modelling conclusions. Such issues are frequently overlooked when using models to interpret biological data, but it is crucial to understand how the choices we make when constructing a model may be affecting the conclusions drawn. There are generally many plausible models consistent with our current understanding and data, so we must consider whether the results obtained with a chosen model are robust (or sensitive) to some level of model uncertainty. 

These developments will be applied to construct reliable mechanistic models using new information gained from high-throughput datasets. To study the gene regulatory networks involved in coordinating spinal cord development, I will use single-cell transcriptomic data that detail the expression levels of thousands of genes in individual cells at different stages of the developmental pathway. I also plan to construct models of cell-type specific signalling pathways that predict the impact of targeted inhibition, using proteomic datasets comprising measurements of protein abundances in various cancer cell lines.

This work will be carried out in the Theoretical Systems Biology Group at Imperial College London. Method developments will be targeted at new experimental data generated by researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and AstraZeneca. Regular engagement with collaborators will ensure that the analytical methods developed are suitable for the planned applications, and form part of an integrated experimental and mathematical approach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Systems biology studies how interactions between components give rise to the observed behaviour of a biological system; modelling is often used to probe the system dynamics. All models are abstract representations of the real systems and, particularly if using data-driven inference methods, the 'best' model structure for a given system is often unclear. For models to provide biological insight we must understand how the assumptions we make influence our conclusions. 

This project will develop methods to i) construct ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of sub-cellular processes using information from high-throughput data, and ii) assess whether conclusions drawn from these models are robust to model uncertainty. These methods will be applied to analyse two specific biological systems as part of collaborations: embryonic spinal cord development and protein signal transduction pathways.

Firstly, I will use single-cell RNA sequencing data from spinal cord progenitor cells at different developmental stages to identify the transcriptional changes that accompany differentiation. Information theoretic-based network inference approaches will be used to identify statistical dependencies between genes, and thus potential regulatory interactions. These results will guide development of mechanistic models describing the gene regulatory networks thought to control correct spatial patterning of cells within the developing spinal cord. Secondly, I will use proteomic datasets that comprise abundance measurements of (phosho)proteins following targeted inhibition or stimulation of protein signalling pathways. Cell-type specific ODE models of these signalling pathways will be constructed and used to predict the response to novel perturbations. 

The proposed work aims to provide new insight into these specific biological systems while developing methodological advances that could be applied to address diverse biological research questions in the future.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Over a short timescale (during this work and subsequent research that builds on it), the knowledge gained about the specific biological systems studied in this project will benefit scientists in related areas of biology research. This project will use mathematical models to study signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks, and develop methods to analyse single-cell gene expression data. Biological principles learned from the particular experimental systems studied in this project will help inform people working on intracellular pathways, or with single-cell data, in other biological contexts.

The fundamental biological questions explored in this work have potentially broad impact over much longer timescales, as part of overall research efforts of the biosciences community to understand the correct functioning and development of cells. This, of course, has long-term impacts for medical advances that improve health (of humans and animals, including commercial livestock). 

A major immediate and mid-term benefit from this work is the development of methods to better assess the uncertainties associated with mathematical modelling. This impacts how we should use and interpret modelling outputs. All models are abstract representations of real systems; understanding the impact of the specific assumptions made in a given model allows us to judge how reliable our conclusions are. Improved understanding and awareness of model uncertainty benefits not only other researchers who develop and apply mathematical models, but also people who make decisions that are, in part, informed by model simulations and predictions. As such, this work is of potential interest across many scientific disciplines, but also within some commercial and government institutions. 

Using models to help interpret experimental data, test hypotheses and guide future experiments is increasingly common in many domains of life science and medical research. There is scope for applying the methods developed during this project to ordinary differential equation (ODE) models inferred from experimental data or those based on existing literature and specialist knowledge. The methodological developments are of potential interest across many other scientific disciplines where models are used to study system dynamics; this is particularly true for other fields, such as epidemiology or economics, that also often rely on phenomenological models (rather than those based on fundamental physical laws). Open-source software implementing the methods developed during this project will be released under a suitable licensing framework allowing other researchers (within and outside academia) to freely use and adapt it for their own applications.

Modelling is commonly used within industry and government research. Model simulations and predictions often help inform decisions and future plans; for example, during the design of infrastructure projects, deciding where to direct future research investment, or when making certain policy decisions. For any such endeavour using models, the robustness of model-based analyses need to be evaluated and communicated. The conclusions drawn from models can only be genuinely useful if accompanied by realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with any predictions. I will engage with different potential groups (e.g. researchers in industry, or relevant government institutions such as Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and Public Health England), and also contribute to efforts to raise public awareness of the value of mathematical modelling across diverse fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>292939</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AA69E3C6-6CD1-4702-840C-301D09DA7FFA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gene Regulatory Network Inference from Single-Cell Data Using Multivariate Information Measures.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cell systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea8d091f81b21a3e25d07d61f5a1f6d2"><gtr:id>ea8d091f81b21a3e25d07d61f5a1f6d2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chan TE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2405-4712</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fd033595a60.94849299</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F9BC0CC-160E-420B-9273-F1DD5A56FDAC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning regulatory models for cell development from single cell transcriptomic data</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current Opinion in Systems Biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/15f329cd3ac4738e86efdb9897ee3be0"><gtr:id>15f329cd3ac4738e86efdb9897ee3be0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Babtie A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fce28d731e3.89799262</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C464E17B-C09B-4722-AF52-9821EAAF1531</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stem Cell Differentiation as a Non-Markov Stochastic Process.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cell systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/551016ae9d090ff03012338f09f4001c"><gtr:id>551016ae9d090ff03012338f09f4001c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stumpf PS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2405-4712</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a5789655f4240.55657911</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D7C1BB09-822B-4607-9163-7E8C4FB51303</gtr:id><gtr:title>How to deal with parameters for whole-cell modelling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bcd8def0e401f5862152aaf941bc5d90"><gtr:id>bcd8def0e401f5862152aaf941bc5d90</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Babtie AC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-5662</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a57895a396936.72675704</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E072228F-508B-414F-BB07-1D19EBD6DFD7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Model of Host-Pathogen Interaction Dynamics Links In Vivo Optical Imaging and Immune Responses.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Infection and immunity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/062552d78fb7e7987720360a260a64c6"><gtr:id>062552d78fb7e7987720360a260a64c6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ale A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0019-9567</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>588b5c22326fd1.31023925</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N011597/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp;
