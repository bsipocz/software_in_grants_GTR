Meta-heuristic optimisation techniques have been widely developed in academia to solve such problems with much success reported in the literature. However, there remains a worrying void between scientific research into optimisation techniques and those problems faced by end-users and addressed by commercial optimisation software vendors. From a commercial perspective, the problems addressed by academia are too simplistic compared to those faced in the real-world, failing to embrace many real-world constraints. From the scientific perspective, researchers have also identified a &amp;quot;lack of advanced metaheuristic techniques in commercial software'' which has been attributed in part to the academic community failing to demonstrate that their solutions are applicable to the needs of the commercial world, and in part to academics failing to impart their message the industrial community.

Meta-heuristic approaches can be costly to develop as they generally require human expertise to integrate specialist knowledge into an algorithm, and expertise in heuristic methods to design and tune algorithms. Recent research has therefore focused on automated algorithm design and configuration which produce tuned solvers that perform well on either individual problems or across suites of problems. One branch of this field is hyper-heuristics, which operates on a space of low-level heuristics, searching for combinations of heuristics which exploit the strength and compensate for the weaknesses of individual known heuristics. The resulting algorithms are cheap to implement, require less human expertise, have robust performance within a problem class, and are portable across problem domains. These features compensate for some reduction in solution quality compared to tailor-made approaches, while still ensuring solutions of acceptable quality. However, most automated design approaches fail to incorporate or recognise a crucial human competence; human beings continuously learn from experience - by generalising observations and feedback, they are able to update their internal problem-solving models in order to continuously improve them, and adapt to changing circumstances. The failure of computational solvers to exploit previous knowledge both wastes useful knowledge and potentially hinders the discovery of good solutions. Furthermore, if the characteristics of instances of problems in the domain change over time, solvers may need to be completely re-tuned or in the worst case redesigned periodically.

This proposal addresses these dual concerns raised above. We propose a novel lifelong-learning hyper-heuristic system which addresses current deficiencies inherent in current systems: it will exhibit short-term learning, producing fast and effective solutions to individual problems and at the same time, long-term learning processes will enable the system to autonomously adapt to new problem characteristics over time. It therefore exploits existing knowledge whilst simultaneously adapting to new information. Secondly, by working closely with two collaborators, a commercial routing software vendor and a forestry expert, our research will be directly informed by real-world problems, accounting for real constraints and performance criteria, thereby producing economic impact. Future advances in optimisation techniques will be facilitated by the development of a problem generator and a number of problem suites which reflect real-world priorities and constraints, derived from actual problem data provided through our collaborators and defined in conjunction with metrics which reflect not only economic drivers but also address environmental impact and the reduction of carbon emissions. This information database will be widely disseminated to provide an extensive platform for future research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research has economic impact and societal impact.

From an economic perspective, there is direct economic benefit to be derived from optimising the daily activities of companies, in the domains addressed of routing, forestry management and packing but also more widely in related domains. End-users of the research - companies who need to optimise their activities - will benefit from algorithms which increase efficiency, drive-down costs and improve sustainability (in economic terms and relating to environmental impact). Crucially, the proposed methods are cheap to implement and adapt autonomously to dynamic environments, thereby reducing the need for specialist expertise to implement or ongoing maintenance costs. Users will have confidence in the developed algorithms due to the use of low-level heuristics accepted by users as opposed to black-box methods, and the rigorous performance evaluation we will conduct which places significant emphasis on calculating the worst-case performance bounds and reliability in order to address user concerns. Secondly, vendors of optimisation software will benefit from access to state-of-the-art optimisation techniques which can be integrated with confidence within existing systems, thereby having direct economic benefit. The close collaboration with commercial partners proposed in this research takes important steps towards aligning research within academia with real-world priorities, which will directly result in economic benefit in the future.

The research also has societal impact. The emphasis on sustainability as a performance criteria when optimising solutions to problems by considering carbon emissions and the environmental impact of solutions (particularly in the work in forestry management addressed) will have future benefits to society as a whole in moving towards a greener, more sustainable way of life.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238068</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pulsion Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pulsion</gtr:description><gtr:id>D3920A03-21CA-487F-B044-61419786514A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

a) Farmers and growers are continuously seeking ways to reduce cost, improve quality and advance productivity. Computer science, alongside other disciplines has significant potential to shape the future of precision farming. Recognising this, the Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board (AHDB) organised a Smart Agriculture Conference to enable for scientists, researchers and engineers across multiple disciplines to build relationships that stimulate discussion and identify potential research and application opportunities that address bridge the gap between farmer need and technological development.

The PI (Emma Hart) was one of three invited speakers invited to present in an Applications session, giving a talk entitled Smart Optimisation for Smart Agriculture: this was an opportunity to describe how the findings from the grant relating to development of new hyper-heuristic optimisation techniques could be applied to generate economic benefit in agriculture.

This talk raised awareness of the field of hyper-heuristic based optimisation to a large audience of non-academics and actors from the Agricultural industry. Optimisation techniques are currently little used hence raising awareness of this has the potential long-term economic impact.


b) Also within the agriculture domain, we have worked closely with a Forestry institute to determine how our findings can be directly used in creating economic impact in the Forestry Management in minimizing wind-damage.

Wind is a major disturbance agent in forests which has important economic, environmental and social impacts. To understand forest ecosystems and to manage forests in order to mitigate the risk of wind damage, it is vital to understand the mechanisms of wind damage. However, current mechanistic models have reached their limit and a re-evaluation of the approach is required to deal with the range of spatial and temporal scales required for a comprehensive understanding. The PI was invited to attend a workshop that brought together forest wind risk modellers and experts in airflow modelling, climate modelling and engineering risk analysis from across the world. The workshop took place over two and a half days with an emphasis on discussion and debate: a report on the recommendations of participants and a joint review article on forest wind risk modelling is currently being written. 

This has built new research collaboration that could lead to considerable economic benefits in the long-term. There is expected short term impact via journal publication submitted to a Forestry Management journal. In addition, we are currently discussing the possibility of providing a web-based prediction service to be used by Forest Manager to assess likely damage given proposed cutting patterns.

c) Our finding that effective heuristics can developed by combining a range of simple heuristics has been directly used by Pulsion Ltd, a software company based in Glasgow. Through contact made by the Business Development Manager within the School of Computing at Edinburgh Napier, we developed new software for the company to be incorporated into their product that they sell.
The software enables efficient routing and scheduling of service engineers across Scotland, and therefore has direct economic benefit.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B4D25279-54D3-4146-A77D-8848E735945C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb06b4c67bf7.45022179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a novel ensemble based optimisation technique called NELLI (Network for Lifelong Learning) that uses a collective of automatically generated optimisation algorithms to solve difficult optimisation problems and continues to learn over time.

There main innovations are as follows.

The use of ensemble (collaborative) methods to tackle optimisation problems. This represents a paradigm shift from the usual approaches of focusing computational effort on developing a 'super algorithm' that solves many instances. Instead, new simple heuristics are generated using an automated programming technique requiring very little computational effort that work well on just a few instances. By combining many simple heuristics into a collective, a powerful optimizer is formed in which the collective is more powerful than any of the individual components.

The second innovation is the development of a method for solving optimisation problems that continuously learns over time, as it gains experience from solving a range of instances. The key elements of the method are a technique for continuously generating and trialling new heuristics against the current set of problems that need to be solved, while retaining a memory, storing algorithms that were useful in the past. Firstly, this enables the system to autonomously adapt to changes in problem structure, e.g. in a scheduling application, new customers orders might arrive that instances have different constraints and operation sizes to previous ones. Secondly, the memory enables the system to exploit previous knowledge in quickly determining an appropriate algorithm based on past experience. Finally, continuous adaptation mechanisms enable the current heuristics to improve over time, as they are exposed to more examples. The new approach is inspired by mechanisms observed in the natural immune system.

Results have shown the new method outperforms existing state-of-the art optimisation algorithms in a number of domains (packing, routing, scheduling). We have additionally provided the first results on lifelong learning optimisation where the instances to be solved change over time.

New insights into the composition of the ensemble have been gained. It is clear that the algorithms within the ensemble must be behaviourally diverse, in that each algorithm should operate in a different region of the problem space, i.e. solve different problemn. We have shown how a method inspired by Artificial Immune Systems enables a collection of diverse algorithms to be evolved. However, open research questions remain as to how best to measure behavioural diversity within a set of algorithms and the extent to which diversity should drive ensemble composition that should be investigated more deeply in the future.

Two new datasets that provide new benchmark resources have been created through the project. The first is a very large collection of new Rich Vehicle Routing instances that were developed as a result of collaboration with Optrak Ltd, who provided new insights into the constraints and features of real-world routing. The second is a new set of benchmark instances for job-shop scheduling. All instances are available for download.

Also noteworthy is the new collaborations and networks we have developed within the Forestry community in Europe who see significant potential for applying optimisation methods in Forestry to reduce wind-damage. Ongoing collaboration with a researcher from Institute of Mountain Science, Shinshu University (Japan) and from INRA (Bordeaux, France) is continuing to pursue this research, and we are seeking further funding.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Forestry industry are keen to use our findings to take forward new research into managing risk of damage in forests through optimisation of cutting patterns.

In the past, the use of search-based optimisation techniques to minimise damage has been hindered by the need to use computationally expensive and time consuming simulations to evaluate potential damage in a given scenario. Our findings have shown that we can replace the simulation with a computational model that accurately reflects results from the simulator, and that damage can be accurately predicted at both stand and tree level.

We are currently working with INRA (Bordeaux) to pursue further funding opportunities to take this work forward and have presented to a large workshop on Wind Damage to European Forests with practitioners and researchers from across the world.

From an academic perspective, the findings are of particular interest to the hyper-heuristic community who focus research on optimisation methods that provide fast, reliable and quality solutions. Our findings relating to *how* to generate new algorithms and how to *combine* algorithms into collaborative sets are both of interest to pushing forward research.

Finally, the new set of rich vehicle routing instances developed in conjunction with a routing company provides a new resource for researchers that brings academic and practical routing closer together, enabling researchers to tackle problems directly relevant to industry</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DCA661AC-980F-4F59-B454-8BDFF69BF98C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56caf949593506.59413575</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://rollproject.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A collection of ~15000 benchmark instances of 1D bin packing problems have been developed and made available to researchers working in optimisation</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CE2855B-478F-4F93-BE41-5E5518DD54F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Used within my research group</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463488b83c7a0.32251297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Binpacking problem benchmark data set</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://rollproject.org/category/benchmark-problems/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collection of 700 new job shop instances</gtr:description><gtr:id>E1A3340D-1BA0-4583-B81D-8CE838349BBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>downloadable
