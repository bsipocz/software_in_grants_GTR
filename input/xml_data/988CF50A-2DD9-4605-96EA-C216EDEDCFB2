Over time, the exhibitions and public engagement opportunities offered by the Museum have utilised changing modes of display and interpretation to challenge audiences to consider military engagements and experiences with fresh eyes. In 2014 the Imperial War Museum will be the central co-ordinating organisation for events pertaining to the centenary of the start of the First World War. The Imperial War Museum is planning to redevelop their galleries with an ambitious programme to set new standards in historical interpretation of the First World War and wartime experience.\n\nThis PhD will examine the presentation of the First World War public temporary and permanent displays in the Imperial War Museum starting from 1960s, a decade that saw radical regeneration of the museum, though to the planned redevelopment of the galleries in the lead up to 2014. Alongside an examination of past practices, the project will develop a critical analysis of the Imperial War Museum's developing programme of exhibitions, events and related audience engagement activities to mark the 2014 centenary.\n\nIn documenting the evolving process of First World War display since the 1960s the project will uncover how memory and commemorative practices have changed and will situate them within different approaches to understanding First World War histories. The project will trace the history of public engagement with the First World War, transformed in recent years with the death of the last veteran, which has extinguished a direct 'living-memory' link to the War itself. This passing, alongside the forthcoming centenary, creates a new focus for the Imperial War Museum, which is seeking to refresh its historical approach to the conflict, amidst increasing academic, public and popular interest in the First World War. This Museum's redevelopment will be a highly significant event, not only within the Museum, but also to other local, national and international museums seeking to learn from the outcomes of the Imperial War Museum redevelopment process. The unique opportunity to study the unfolding nature of this important redevelopment lies at the heart of this PhD research.\n\nThe benefits of the research are manifold. The PhD student will benefit from working across the academic, museum, heritage and policy contexts of the project gaining valuable transferable skills. The research will stimulate discussion around the presentation, display and engagement with remembrance, commemoration and memory in First World War heritage site and museum contexts. The project will work at the interface between cultural and historical geography, museum, heritage and First World War studies, extending academic debates in these fields. The research will feed into the 2014 redevelopment of the Imperial War Museum by engaging staff with the past politics of display and opening up critical discussion around alternative approaches to the presentation of First World War histories. Here the development of genealogical approaches and methods of engaging new audiences are significant.\n\nImportantly, the research will offer a sustained analysis of the contemporary and historical presentation of First World War histories in a national public institution. By using closed archival sources linked to exhibition practices, collecting new oral histories of staff involved in curating past exhibitions, alongside the active participation in planning for the 2014, the student will be uniquely placed to offer a critical lens on the past and present work of the Imperial War Museum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?:\n1. Museum Redevelopment Team 2014\nThe Redevelopment Team of curators is responsible for developing the new public displays and engagement programmes for the Imperial War Museum (IWM) linked to the 2014 anniversary of the First World War.\n\n2. Museum Redevelopment Implementation Team 2014\nThe Implementation Team involves exhibition designers, IT and digital specialists, graphic designers working towards the 2014 redevelopment.\n\n3. Visitors to the Imperial War Museum and website\nThe IWM attracts over 2 million visitors per year to its London site and over 9 millions visits to its website.\n\n4. General public engaging with the 2014 anniversary activities\n2014 marks the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War and the IWM will be at the heart of coordinating the 2014 anniversary programme which will be delivered across the UK and to an international audience.\n\nHow will they benefit from this research?:\n1. Museum staff - Redevelopment Team 2014\nA key benefit for this team is the opportunity to have rigorous and contextual analysis undertaken of past and present practices of display. This analytical lens is critical in the run up to the 2014 anniversary as the IWM intends to design new galleries that will set international standards in interpretation and design. The redevelopment team want the CDA student to offer them intellectual challenges and ask critical questions as the developments for 2014 unfold. Knowledge exchange will occur through regular participation in team meetings, presentations on key topics, and summary reports of findings.\n\n2. Museum staff - Redevelopment Implementation Team 2014\nThis team has the practical task of delivering the public displays for the 2014 redevelopment. These members will be able to use the CDA student as an expert resource on past practices of display and the new practices they will be implementing. Knowledge exchange will occur through regular participation in team meetings, presentations on key topics, and summary reports of findings.\n\n3. Visitors to the Imperial War Museum/Website\nThe CDA student will engage with the education and wider public learning public programmes of the Museum, through the development of resources linked to research findings or the delivery of public talks. The student will have a direct impact on audience experience through their involvement with the shape and design of the 2014 redevelopment (museum and web presence).\n\n4. General public engaging with the 2014 commemoration activities\nThe Museum will be heavily involved with the national activities planed for 2014. The student's work will impact directly as the conversations initiated by the student help shape the development of the activities.\n\nWhat will be done to ensure they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?\nThe Department of Geography, University of Exeter and the IWM will ensure that useful knowledge and outcomes are identified through regular supervisory meetings, whole project team meetings (including staff from IWM) and via regular reports on the applied aspects of the research. The student will work with the IWM to ensure that the research feeds into relevant projects. The supervisory team will call on the expertise of the University's Knowledge Transfer team to help maximize the impact of the research. The University has a dedicated team of KT specialists who provide expert support for postgraduate research. The student will work with the Imperial War Museum and the University Press Officers to ensure that research findings are publicized. In addition to the resources of the Imperial War Museum, the Geography Department has a graphics design team who will generate professional outputs, such as maps, photographs and other visual reproductions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54292</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023945/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
