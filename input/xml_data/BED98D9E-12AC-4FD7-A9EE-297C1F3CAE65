Barrier function is maintained by stem cell-driven tissue renewal and regeneration in response to injury/infection. Epithelial recognition of bacterial products occurs under steady-state conditions and plays an important role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Bacteria have been shown to regulate epithelial stem cell biology through direct and indirect mechanisms in lower organisms such as drosophila, but whether this occurs in mammalian systems remains to be elucidated. Mobilisation of tissue-resident immune cells to the stem cell niche is also a likely mechanism by which luminal bacteria regulate stem cell-driven epithelial. Granulocytes play an important role in tissue homeostasis in a variety of tissues as well as being implicated in epithelial repair/regeneration and resolution of inflammation in IBD. However, it is not clear how signals and dynamic interactions between bacteria, granulocytes and the epithelium work in concert to orchestrate epithelial stem cell-driven tissue renewal. Objective: to determine the role granulocytes play in communicating commensal luminal inputs to epithelial stem cells? We use real-time confocal bioimaging of the mouse intestinal stem cell niche (Lgr5-EGFP transgenic mice), intestinal epithelial crypts, granulocytes and fluorescent E.coli to determine their role in epithelial stem cell-driven tissue homeostasis. The outcome of this study is fundamental to the understanding of the role of granulocytes and commensal microbes in tissue homeostasis, regeneration and even inflammation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1275325</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our research aims to understand fundamental cellular processes in health that can eventually inform the scientific field about inflammatory bowel disease or cancer and therefore in the longer term (&amp;gt;15years) ultimately treatments for patients. 
Potential Economic and Quality of Life Impacts are therefore a long way down the research pipeline with this research as it is so fundamental. 
However, although this work was not on medical research but on understanding how the healthy gut works our research could ultimately inform us of what goes wrong in inflammatory bowel disease; This disease has significant treatment costs with up to ?762 spent per patient per year. With an estimated 182,700 people in the UK having a form of IBD the total annual cost to the NHS is estimated to be ?131 million. Furthermore the incidence of IBD is rising with time. Several treatments for IBD have shown some success but new treatments are lacking, which stems from a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in gut homeostasis versus disease. 
Speculatively, in the longer term (&amp;gt;10 years) pharmaceutical companies potentially may be in a position to use our research models; potentially moving from mouse studies to the human we in the longer term be able to develop more targeted treatments for patients with less side effects leading to improved health and longevity of patients and so impact positively on the downstream costs of health care.
We have also had a societal impact on informaing the public of our research for example; we have engaged with the public doing outreach activities in particular involving school children, high school teachers, undergraduate students and the general public informing them of the impact of our research. The IFR holds Open Days every few years, the last one in 2012. During these events we also convey the gut research we are conducting in the laboratory and also impress upon them the importance of experimental animals models in our work. These events have helped demonstrate the translational pipeline from mouse to human and to increase public understanding of basic research towards the clinic. We also have presented research at Caf? Scientifique; a forum to present scientific research to the public. Our Gut Health and Food Safety Department has a webpage, which is updated regularly with blogs and tweets concerning ongoing research with in the program in our research group.
We also have attempted to inspire the next generation of scientists and have routinely hosted undergraduate students for their undergraduate projects in the laboratory. We also retain these students for future PhD projects or technician posts in our laboratory after their graduation. 
We routinely host high school students providing them with work experience in the laboratory. This also includes public engagement with regards to understanding the role of animals in research including visits to the animal facility, which we regard to be an important aspect of research to disseminate to the public. We have also hosted high School Teachers and presented research at the IFR Teacher event which entails informing teachers of the nature of the research conducted at IFR and also what careers are open to their children if they choose to pursue a career in science. 

In addition we have helped society by engaging in research Staff Training of the post-doctoral researcher on the project as they benefit from improved experimental, modelling and transferable skills that will aid the future earning power of the national workforce.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ACFFE485-1923-4076-BAAB-AC4F83EEC3DF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ce726b01707.28971363</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The intestinal epithelium forms a barrier between commensal bacteria and the underlying immune cells that are located in the lamina propria. Exclusion of bacteria by the epithelium from the lamina propria prevents an inflammatory response and helps maintains gut health. The colonic epithelium constantly renews itself through proliferation of epithelial stem cells located at the base of epithelial invaginations called crypts. Work from our laboratory, and others, have shown that shown that immune cells are recruited to the epithelial stem cell niche following luminal-sensing of commensal bacteria during homeostasis and injury. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the epithelial stem cell niche either modulates, and/or is modulated by, immune cells to maintain epithelial health are largely unknown. Recently, we demonstrated a novel concept for the maintenance of a healthy colon in the mouse. We show that luminal bacteria, gut epithelial stem cells and immune cells called monocytes, work in concert to maintain gut health / homeostasis. We also have described a intriguing phenomenon whereby crypt epithelial stem cells can extend cellular processes to make contact with monocytes and that monocytes make contact in a reciprocal fashion. Taken together our findings suggest that the interaction between crypt stem cells and the monocyte play a key role in maintaining gut health. We are currently investigating whether another cell type an eosinophil granulocyte can exert similar effects on the renewal of the epithelium.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Speculatively, in the longer term (&amp;gt;10 years) pharmaceutical companies potentially may be in a position to use our research models; potentially moving from mouse studies to the human we in the longer term be able to develop more targeted treatments for patients with less side effects leading to improved health and longevity of patients and so impact positively on the downstream costs of health care.
