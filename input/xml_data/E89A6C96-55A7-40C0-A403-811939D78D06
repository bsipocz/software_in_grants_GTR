Thousands of people are likely to be involved in these projects in varying capacities, and this proposal will enable the University of Cambridge to impact on the lives and activities of large numbers of people, most of whom have little or no previous experience of carrying out community heritage projects, or of carrying out research (with or without university support). 

Cambridge Community Heritage (CCH) helped 25 community groups bid to HLF in summer 2012, providing tailored, individual advice and encouragement. 22 of these were successful (an 88% success rate, compared to a national success rate of c. 50%). and the effective support provided CCH is considered to be a major factor in such a high success rate. This proposal for Phase 2 'Follow-up' funding aims to build on the Phase 1 success of CCH and the community groups by enabling CCH to provide ongoing intelligently targeted support to 24 community groups who have requested this from CCH during the delivery phase of their project. The support needs of these groups have been explicitly assessed and identified in consultation with these groups, modes and means for delivering this support have been devised and are detailed in the Case for Support.

In summary, the funds bid for here will enable a team of nine post-doctoral researchers be based at the University of Cambridge to be tasked with supporting the community groups and their projects in 2013. Each group will be linked to a named researcher, with whom they will in most cases already be familiar from Phase 1 of the Cambridge Community Heritage project. The researchers will provide help, advice and support in response to specific enquiries from their groups via phone and e-mail, will also provide some on-site or in-person support to project activities, and will contribute to workshops on specific subjects such as oral history. Researchers will be able to consult with other members of the CCH team, and more widely within the University if this is needed. Researchers will also take responsibility for monitoring the progress of their community projects, of developing close and effective working relationships with groups which will maximise the potential for future research-driven collaborations, and of advising re the collection of feedback from community participants.

All groups and researchers will be able to ask the CCH PI for advice and support if needed, and to make use of a wiki-based website managed and monitored by the CCH project, which will enable members to contribute and share their activities, experiences, enquiries and advice, with the aim of enhancing the sense of wider engagement with different projects and communities amongst community groups and researchers. 

An end-of-year workshop will be held in Cambridge for researchers and community group representatives to review experiences and discuss possible future research collaborations. Feedback will be collected from as many participants as possible, in consultation with community groups, to allow impact to be assessed in the short term and in the longer term, to provide data for research into the value of community heritage projects to communities.

The CCH Phase 2 project in 2013 will be run by PI Dr Carenza Lewis, University of Cambridge Department of Archaeology and Director of Access Cambridge Archaeology, who was PI for CCH Phase 1. With appropriate administrative support, Dr Lewis will oversee and facilitate effective collaboration between the large number of project partners (researchers, community groups, university partners and the public), will monitor project progress and ensure project aims are delivered on time and within budget.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Large numbers of the public and institutions involved in running or taking part in 'All Our Stories' community heritage project funded by the HLF All Our Stories programme will benefit in a wide range of ways from the CCH project, as will the communties hosting the projects. 

Within local communities, beneficiaries will include (i) community group members; (ii) those running the community projects; (iii) people taking part in and making an active contribution to the substance of the project (eg as interviewees, volunteers, performers, etc); (iv) 'casual engagers' with the project (eg visitors to excavations, viewers of exhibitions, attendees at performances, visitors to websites etc). (v) museums and other local heritage centres (vi) Local shops, businesses and service industries. 

People of all ages and backgrounds will be involved in researching their heritage and communicating their discoveries, including primary and secondary school children, adults, families, retired people and people with special needs, from a wide range of rural, urban and transient communities. The University of Cambridge involvement will be an added spur to interest, and provide an opportunity to raise academic aspirations amongst people of all ages.

Members of groups i-iv will benefit from enhanced knowledge and understanding of the heritage which is the subject of the project; enhanced appreciation and care for the project heritage; enhanced sense of connection with the project heritage; enhanced knowledge and understanding of wider heritage related to the project; enhanced appreciation and care for aspects of wider heritage; enhanced sense of connection with wider heritage; better knowledge, appreciation and sense of connection with the University of Cambridge. 

Positive impacts on health are anticipated as participants will in many cases be engaged in physical activity, while emotional well-being will be positively impacted amongst participants by sharing in group activities within and beyond their local communities. Communities will be benefited by enhanced community cohesion engendered by public endeavours shared within between diverse participating individuals and sectors.

Public and private institutions such as museums and local archives will benefit from increased use of their resources. Small businesses such as local shops will benefit during community activities and events from increased footfall as participants buy materials, meals etc locally, and in providing services supporting the delivery of projects, such as printing leaflets, manufacturing signboards etc. Community centres village halls etc are likely to see increased use. 

Where new resources such as heritage trails and visitor centres are being created, such increased use is likely to endure beyond the end of the project. Likewise, skills, knowledge, interests and enhanced community cohesion is likely to represent a legacy which will outlive the project.

The outcomes of the project are likely to be of interest to the heritage industry (local, regional, national and possibly internationally; public engagement teams in universities/local government; and local and national community cohesion teams/policy units.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71227</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hildersham Village History Recorders</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hildersham Village History Recorders</gtr:description><gtr:id>547DF264-128A-412A-9A2B-A58FE6537F44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not known</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cdec57cd400.82987068-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Not known</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In 2012 CCH helped Hildersham Village History Recorders develop their successful AOS bid, but while accepting the offer of support from CCH in running their project they worked independently on their project in 2013.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>West Wickham District Local History Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>West Wickham District Local History Group: 'West Wickham Big Village Dig'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7922B161-65C4-48B5-ADAA-B1DBF48232EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activities were blogged and filmed and a written technical report prepared.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54648f7a82ff89.99107660-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>West Wickham District Local History Group involved scores of local residents in excavating 19 archaeological test pits to discover when and where settlement in the medieval period was focussed in the parish of West Wickham, Cambridgeshire.

After the training day, more than 10 community groups undertook archaeological excavation as oart of their HLF projects, involving hundreds of people. The excavations developed a wide range of new skills and instilled a strong sense of community spirit amongst participants. New knowledge and understanding was derived in a range of areas, inlcuding the nature of high status rural residences and the pattern of settlement development. The latter was derived from test pit excavations carried out in several eastern English communities including Toft, West Wickham, Shillington, Foxearth, Meldreth, Wimpole and six along the Gaywood valley. Each project has generated a written technical report s, which will be submitted to local archives (including HERs), form the basis of papers in local journal and summaries published in Medieval Settlement Research, the journal of MSRG, the scholarly research group for medieval settlement studies.

95% of attendees rated the day as very helpful (the top rating possible) and all felt more, or much more, confident about pursuing this activity in the future. After the training day, more than 15 community groups involved their members in activities involving local historical research as part of their HLF-funded community heritage projects, creating archives and edited resources which will be of value to future researchers into local communities and histories of place. Some groups created heritage centres or trails intended to draw others into finding out about or participating in community heritage, and a compulsory requirement by HLF that community groups should disseminate their results via digital outputs as well as community events ensured the outcomes were widely disseminated and much appreciated in the short term, and will remain accessible in the longer term.

This wide range of projects delivered new perspectives on different heritages and a wealth of resources for future research, instilled new skills amongst participants and developed new networks for the future. 97% of respondents felt participation had increased knowledge of their heritage, and the average rating for the extent to which the projects had increased participants' sense of connection with their heritage was 8.6/10. Attitudes to collaborating with universities in co-producing research averaged 9/10 (90%).

The CCH programme involved 28 different community groups all running different projects each involving 3-10 different engagement activities. The time required to enter each of these on Researchfish as a separate Engagement Activity is too great for this to be realistically possible, but the activities are included in the overall Report to AHRC by PI Dr C Lewis which is included as one of the pubblications stemming from this project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2959420C-A646-4334-A225-B239EF182AA0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464acc8bd2ec5.82834406</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>AHRC-funded Cambridge Community Heritage (CCH) (2012-13) involved nine University of Cambridge researchers in Archaeology, History, Heritage and Public Engagement under PI Dr Carenza Lewis in collaborating with community groups in eastern England to run heritage-related community projects, bringing researchers and communities together to explore, uncover and record aspects of community heritage. CCH was a follow-on project from Cambridge Collaborations for Community Heritage in 2012, in which the Cambridge team helped groups develop ideas and apply for Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) funding to run heritage-related projects. 



A fundamental principle of the CCH programme was that the project ideas came from the communities themselves, rather than being suggested by academics. Each project therefore involved community groups in exploring aspects of the heritage which were important to them. Throughout 2013, CCH worked with a diverse range of community groups to support the delivery of projects which were funded by the HLF under its 'All Our Stories' strand. Groups included those representing and supporting communities of place, occupation, interest and identity, including local historical societies, football clubs, church groups, traveller communities, schools, women's groups and military regiments. 



The CCH programme at the University of Cambridge successfully extended research networks beyond academia by involving individuals, groups and schools in jointly developing and running collaborative community heritage projects, helping break down perceptions that research is an exclusive and inaccessible activity: Cambridge Community Heritage offered anyone and everyone the chance to get involved in heritage-related research projects in, with, about and for their own communities. Individuals, community groups, special interest societies and schools contributed their ideas, knowledge, contacts, enthusiasm and hard work, with the University of Cambridge adding expertise, experience and knowledge as required in order to run valuable, viable research projects that would otherwise have been impossible. 



In taking part in these projects, particiants advanced knowledge and understanding of their heritage while also enriching communities as they and others forged new social connections, developed new skills and gained new perspectives on their surroundings and the wider world. The diverse range of projects delivered a host of new perspectives on different heritages and a wealth of resources for future research, instilled new research skills and other transferrable skills in participants, developed new networks for the future and allowed researchers, especially the three project ECRs, to develop experience and skills in engaging wider publics in research activity. 



More than 4,400 members of the public were actively involved with CCH in 2013 in one way or another. Very few had any previous experience of research, and even fewer of collaborating with universities in conducting research. Feedback showed that participation significantly increased community group participants' knowledge of their heritage (87%) and their sense of connection with their heritage (89%). Even greater was the positive impact that involvement had on participants' attitude to collaborating with universities in co-producing research (94%).



Project-specific research outcomes from the 25 projects were many and varied. One specific example was in respect of new knowledge and understanding about historic settlement development, derived from test pit excavations which were carried out by hundreds of members of several different eastern English communities including Toft, West Wickham, Shillington, Foxearth, Meldreth, Wimpole and six along the Gaywood valley. As a consequence, academics, heritage professionals and local residents now benefit from an informed understanding of how each of these communities developed spatially and demographically in the longue duree, and the ways in which these developmental trajectories compare and conatrast with each other. Thus in aggregate, these results have also advanced understanding of wider patterns of long-term change. Each project has generated a written technical report with maps showing the distribution of material of different dates, which will be submitted to local archives (including HERs), form the basis of papers in journals and summaries published in Medieval Settlement Research, the journal of MSRG, the scholarly research group for medieval settlement studies. The results will also feed into ongoing research into the development of settlement, landscape and demography in southern England. 



A number of CCH projects collected living memories and oral histories which have been recorded, transcribed and archived, with much material provided by older community members recalling decades-old experiences, lifestyles and lifeways, many predating the second warld war and most now in decline or entirely extinct. Projects invoving members of some very hard-to-reach groups such as travellers, as well as others traditionally secretive about their specialist 'guild knowledge' such as horsemen, produced particularly valuable outputs as these accounts can often be impossibly inaccessible to outsiders. Resulting recordings, transcripts and films represent an invaluable resource for researchers interested in society, community, technology and change. Numerous local history CCH projects have likewise helped community volunteers create and disseminate collations which would have been impossible to achieve otherwise and which will be of value to future researchers into local histories and communities of place. Several groups created heritage centres, trails or school packs which will draw others into finding out about and/or participating in community heritage. A compulsory requirement by HLF that community groups should disseminate their results via digital outputs as well as community events ensured the outcomes were widely disseminated and much appreciated in the short term, and will remain accessible in the longer term.



Broader outcomes of CCH relate to the impact the projects have had on individuals and communities who have participated or been involved. Attitudes are typified by the Saffron Walden project, in which CCH worked with school students and the local museum to find, unearth and date the previously unproven line of the 12th century castle bailey in their local town, culminating in a report which will contribute to advancing wider understanding of medieval town development. The ?Saffron Walden community project leader commented that &amp;quot;The support was accessible, friendly, practical and pitched just right throughout. The way in which support and workshops were provided from pre-application to concluding celebration was exemplary and a useful lesson for me (as a museum curator) in how to work in participation with community groups. The intense 'dig week' was great fun and a thoroughly memorable and inspiring experience all round - all project participants felt it was a privilege...&amp;quot; 



The postive impact of the CCH programme was extremely, and demonstrably, high. Overall, when asked to rate the impact of their CCH project experience on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being lowest and 10 highest), feedback from the 23/25 of the community groups who responded rated their experience of participating overwhelmingly positively, with average overall score of precisely 9/10. 100% of respondents felt they had gained new knowledge about their heritage, and 89% felt they had learned more about other people who were interested in their heritage. The impact that involvement in the project had on communities' attitudes to working with universities was even more positive: attitudes to working with university researchers rated 9.1/10 average; attitudes to the University of Cambridge generally rated 9.3/10 and the prospect of collaborating again in the future averaged 9.4/10. 



Overall, CCH showed that working with community groups and communities delivered new contacts, new ideas and boundless energy and enthusiasm, and had an invigorating effect on attitudes to research, within and beyond HEIs. CCH successfully developed and delivered new ways of developing new research topics by inviting the public to propose ideas, rather than the academic community - initiating many new avenues of investigation which would not have been embarked upon otherwise. CCH broke the conventional research mould by involving the public as active instigators, enablers and participants in the research, rather than as passive subjects or observers of research. CCH also showed the extent and ways in which the contribution of academic researchers made non-academic HLF-funded projects more confident, more successful and more academically robust than would otherwise have been possible.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As the CCH programme was seated throughout in non-academic contexts, it is self-evident that the ways of working can be used in non-academic contexts, as they have already been proven to work in a wide range of such arenas. 



The methods used in the CCH programme can clearly be used in a very wide range of wide non-academic contexts to inspire, develop and develiver programmes of activity which advance academic knowledge and understanding and also enrich communities and build social capital by instilling new skills, expanding social networks and enhancing understanding of, and hence appreciation of, local environments and local heritage.
