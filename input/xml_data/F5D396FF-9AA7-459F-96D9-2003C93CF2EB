For example, Latin authors tell us that a Latin accented syllable has a 'circumflex' if it is the next-to-last syllable in the word and has a long vowel, provided that the vowel of the last syllable is short. Exactly the same happens to be true in Greek.

Modern scholars either (i) comment that Latin grammarians 'ape' Greek grammarians on accentological matters, as if they fail to notice that Latin and Greek are different languages, or (ii) argue that Latin really had an accent remarkably similar to that of Greek, with acutes and circumflexes and remarkably Greek-like rules for their distribution.

But both views miss an important point. By the time our Latin grammarians are writing, the distinction between acute and circumflex accent is very unlikely to have been audible in Greek. Thus if we suspect the claim that certain Latin words had a circumflex of being nonsensical, it is hardly more so than the claim that certain Greek words had a circumflex in any audible sense, at least at the time when the Latin grammarians encountered this claim.

Moreover, long after the circumflex and acute accents had ceased to sound different from each other in Greek, Greek grammarians continued to make use of this distinction in their descriptions of the language. The same is true for the distinction between long and short vowels, among other concepts. Rather than being merely relics of the past, these features had acquired a different status in Greek grammatical thought. They had become abstract features--in other words technical devices that helped in the overall description of the language. For example, the concept that some vowels were theoretically long while some were theoretically short made it feasible to continue describing the possible positions for the Greek accent very succinctly (the accent may fall on any of the last three syllables, unless the last contains a 'long vowel').

In this light, when Latin grammarians take over from Greek grammarians a concept such as the distinction between acute and circumflex, they are taking the concept directly into an abstract level of their own descriptive system. For Latin the concept is of little practical use as a technical device, but its abstract nature makes it easy to take over without any consequences for actual pronunciation. Conversely, when Latin grammarians make statements about matters whose Greek counterparts would have been perfectly audible (for example the actual syllable on which the accent falls), these should be taken seriously as statements about the sound of Latin.

An example here is the Latin grammarians' doctrine that the enclitics -que, -ve, -ne and -ce cause the accent to go on the preceding syllable, regardless of the weight of that syllable. Modern scholars have frequently doubted that this can always be true, and have suspected undue influence from Greek grammarians writing about similar sequences in Greek. But statements about which syllable is accented are not interpretable as belonging only to an abstract level: they should be taken seriously as statements about the sound of Latin.

The proposed project will gather and present evidence for abstract thinking in the Greek grammatical tradition on accentuation and vowel lengths (both coming under the ancient discipline of 'Prosody'), and will develop the hypothesis that abstract features of Greek grammatical description--including some that became abstract as the language changed--were taken over into Latin grammatical thinking as abstract features.

The project aims to encourage more work on similar questions in other grammatical traditions of the world. Furthermore, it aims to enrich language teaching and learning in schools by drawing attention to historical and modern techniques for describing one language in categories imported from another, thus making a foreign language less alien.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I am often asked how we know how ancient languages were pronounced. The question interests a very broad range of people, including those learning an ancient language (who want to know, in addition, how the specific language they are learning was actually pronounced) and many who simply find the question intrinsically interesting. Related topics that capture the imagination include how languages have been taught over the centuries, and how the teaching of one language can affect the teaching of another. Famously, the teaching of Latin grammar has influenced the teaching of English, and indeed English usage itself, on many points including the idea that split infinitives are inelegant and the idea that sentences should not end with a preposition. These are the contexts in which I envisage the research appealing widely outside academia.

In particular, the research will interest the following groups outside academia:

(1) School teachers and pupils interested in the pronunciation of ancient Greek and Latin, and in how we know about these things. In order to reach this audience I plan to offer an article to Omnibus, the magazine for students of the Classical world published by the Joint Association of Classical Teachers (JACT), and a seminar at the JACT Greek Summer School in Dorset.

(2) Teachers and pupils at schools that do not necessarily teach Latin or ancient Greek, or have recently begun to do so (often with the help of Classics for All: http://www.classicsforall.org.uk). The National Curriculum now includes a compulsory ancient or modern language component at primary school level, and the DfE Key Stage Four Latin Initiative is prompting secondary school teachers of modern languages to take up the teaching of Latin. We are therefore at a point when enrichment activity stands to make a real difference to the success of new language teaching and learning initiatives at schools, and to teachers taking up a new language in order to make it available to the next generation. I would therefore like to expand my outreach activities by actively offering enrichment talks to teachers and pupils at schools that would particularly benefit, on topics connected to the teaching of languages over the centuries, and how the teaching of one language can interact with the teaching of another. When one language is described in terms of categories borrowed from another, as when early modern grammars of English give English a Latin-style system of grammatical genders and cases, the result is often dismissed as artificial nonsense; yet such descriptions can serve a useful purpose in making a foreign language (in this case Latin) less alien. More generally, by drawing attention to historical and modern language teaching and learning techniques (regardless of whether we like or adopt them) I hope to enrich the intrinsic interest of language teaching and learning itself. As part of these events I would include structured discussion to encourage teachers and pupils to reflect explicitly on their own strategies for language teaching and learning.

(3) Members of the general public. I frequently talk to groups of interested members of the public, and plan to continue these activities. Possible topics connected to the project again include language teaching and learning through the centuries, the influence of one tradition on another, and a talk in praise of the traditional grammarian. Traditional grammarians tend to receive a bad press as pedants out of touch with everyday language use, and this often prevents us giving them a second thought. Yet when we really understand them in the context of their own times and experiences of language, they do not always turn out to be so out of touch, and they can teach us a tremendous amount about their languages.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>103977</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School talk (Mill Hill, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A69E8C78-BADC-4710-8974-7EFF3CFC41B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk on language learning across languages, cultures and time, to about 60 year 11 pupils doing languages at Mill Hill County High School in London.

Both talks were interactive introductions to Linear B, and both groups had been given a taster session by their teacher the previous week. The talk to the younger group in particular generated very impressive questions and discussion. The teacher reported back that this group &amp;quot;had an absolutely brilliant time, and I was so impressed with how they responded and stepped up to the challenge! They had remembered so much from the taster session and they asked such interesting questions. They really enjoyed it.&amp;quot; As for the older group, who were rather quieter, the teacher said that they had responded similarly to the taster session, and felt that I shouldn't worry. (These talks connect to my broader interests in the history of the Greek language rather than the specific research focus of my current AHRC-funded project.

In 2016 there were just over 100 participants, comprising groups from Farnborough Hill School, Leweston School, St Gabriel's School, and Langley Academy, as well as numerous families and individuals. My role was to be a Roman mathematics teacher. My participation was thus linked broadly to my interests in ancient education. It has given me a chance to complement my interests in grammatical instruction by developing some knowledge of basic Roman instruction in mathematics, and some facility in using a Roman counting board and abacus and in teaching these skills.

After extensive on-line discussion, the group met in September 2016 for a workshop which I led (see the separate report on this workshop, which has been the main formal output of the working group so far). Since the workshop, I have led work on a collaborative article which is now close to completion, and have given feedback to group members as they write up their individual contributions. I was also able to give feedback to one group member on grant applications to support further work of his, and I understand that one of these has been successful. On the initiative of one member of the group (Chad Howe), most members of the group are sharing bibliography via a Zotero group. Looking beyond the outputs that will arise from our AHRC-funded work, several members of the group are keen to collaborate on an exhibition in the future. I would like to make this possible, but will need to seek further funding for this purpose.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c536a2860219.16422393</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School talk (Dorset)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A9197DD1-A85B-46CF-A843-C53EEB7DC699</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk on language learning across languages, cultures and time.

Leweston school also reported back to my Faculty's Outreach Office as follows: &amp;quot;Our Head of EAL commented: 'It has helped to think about how we compare languages and how we create meanings and forms that might misguide us by trying to fit new language into our existing concepts of language. This will help me in my teaching to look out for these kinds of misunderstandings.'&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Students are keen to attend future lectures. I have noticed students making more confident comparisons between ancient and modern languages.&amp;quot; Sherborne school reported as follows: 'Fifteen of our girls attended a brilliant lecture 'Language learning across languages, cutures and time' by Dr Philomen Probert of Oxford University last Thursday at Leweston School. Dr Probert described what we can learn about the approach to the study of languages from ancient times to the present day through the study of books about grammar and language learning in languages ranging from ancient Greek and Old Church Slavonic, through seventeeth-century German and to modern Lithuanian. The lecturer's encyclopaedic knowledge of the historical development of languages and language learning gave the girls a wonderful flavour of Oxford University teaching in a fascinating subject and the girls who attended took the opportunity to ask questions after the lecture.'

This work brings evidence from ancient Greek grammatical texts and medieval manuscripts together from a new angle, and shows that there is remarkably strong support for a previously undescribed rule for accenting sequences of ancient Greek enclitics. About 35 people attended and the talk sparked questions and discussion, including points which will be beneficial when we write the work up. (This publication will not itself be part of my current AHRC-funded project, but the work arises from a chance discovery due to discussion with Dr Roussou of this project and her current project. We now have in mind a succinct book on ancient Greek thought on enclitics, for a future date.)

Since the start of the award, I have given a further talk on Greek pronunciation since the Renaissance to an audience consisting of members of the general public plus school pupils and teachers; talks on 'Language learning across languages, cultures and time' at five schools and at a Teaching and Learning Conference run by OCR; and a talk on &amp;quot;Why languages are similar to each other&amp;quot; at a further school. As planned, I have also given a talk on how we know how ancient languages were pronounced, at a retirement community in the US. I have participated in five further engagement activities linked more broadly to my interests in ancient education and in the history of the Greek language. Several of the talks and other activities have generated further enthusiasm for similar or related activities in the future.

I have also disseminated research findings of this project widely via academic talks at seminars and conferences in the UK (twice), USA (twice), Canada, and Germany, in addition to running an international workshop that included an individual research contribution of mine.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B7F1FD4C-30FC-4269-A004-2C9F8DCE9E45</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ded71f1326b7.52245663</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research has first of all improved our understanding of ancient Greek thought on prosody, and especially on the ways in which a word's accentuation sometimes depended on the particular words around it. For this purpose Greek grammarians made extensive use of two levels of description: a level at which each word was considered to 'own' exactly one accent (its 'natural accent'), and a level reflecting actual pronunciation. In effect, the first of these levels was an abstract one: the function of the natural accent was to provide a starting point for applying rules, the output of which would be the word as actually pronounced in a given context. However, Greek grammarians equated the abstract form of a word (the one with the 'natural accent') with the way in which the word was actually pronounced if quoted or mentioned out of context (its 'citation form'). It is by no means inevitable that a descriptive system operating with two levels of description should equate an abstract starting point for applying rules and a citation form (in fact modern linguistic frameworks tend to avoid this equation quite explicitly), but our understanding of ancient Greek linguistic thought is improved by the recognition that such an equation was made there. A further important point that aids our understanding of ancient Greek thought on prosody is that ancient Greek grammarians move very easily between the two levels of description when commenting on the accent of a word in a text. Confusion in modern scholarship has resulted from insufficient appreciation of this point.

Secondly, this research has improved our understanding of the ways in which ancient Greek thought on prosody was understood and transformed by Latin grammarians writing on Latin prosody. Latin grammarians learned to think about prosody from Greek grammarians, and took over a descriptive system with all the large-scale features just mentioned. In doing so, they sometimes took an item (such as an accent for a particular kind of word) from the abstract level of Greek grammatical description onto the abstract level of the Latin system, without this meaning that the item always gives rise to identical concrete, audible facts in the two languages. In some instances, differences between the two languages are implemented in the grammatical system by means of different rules turning similar forms on the abstract level into different ones on the concrete level. 

On a more detailed level this research sheds light on key concepts of the Latin grammatical tradition, such as the concepts of (1) vowel length and (2) the circumflex accent:
(1) On the face of it, one might say that when the distinctive vowel length contrast of Classical Latin was lost as such, grammarians continued to make an abstract distinction between 'long' and 'short' vowels. To a large extent this is indeed what happened, and yet the story is more interesting because the literal meanings of the words for 'long' and 'short' continued to be clear, and grammarians developed an intriguing way of reconciling these literal meanings with a system in which vowels could count as 'long' without being audibly so.
(2) There has been a long-standing debate about the status of the circumflex accent in Latin grammatical thought, with opposing conclusions being drawn from the same pieces of evidence. On the one side, it is argued that an acute/circumflex distinction was audible on long accented vowels in Latin, while on the other side it is argued that no such distinction was audible. Both conclusions have some good observations behind them, yet on the face of it they cannot both be right. The research for this project points towards a resolution in which both sides are, after all, partly right. Latin grammarians did not hear an acute/circumflex distinction on accented long vowels, yet at least at an early date they thought they could, because the distinction mapped onto something they could hear: an accent was considered a 'circumflex' if and only if it fell on a long vowel, in a word containing no more than one short vowel's worth of vowel after the accent.

The research also helps to make sense of some apparently obscure ancient discussions. For example, new light can be shed on a notoriously difficult passage of Quintilian, which contains precious evidence for the early stages of Latin grammatical thought on prosody. Another apparently enigmatic doctrine that we can now understand is transmitted in a fragmentary bilingual papyrus of the third century AD.

A further key finding is that in some instances, our earliest clearly datable evidence for a concept of Greek grammatical thought on prosody comes from a Latin text in which the concept has already been taken over for Latin. Latin grammatical texts are therefore important not only for our understanding of Latin grammatical thought about Latin prosody (and the take-up of Greek grammatical thought in this tradition), but can also lead us to a better understanding of the Greek tradition itself.

Finally, a key text for our understanding of early Greek thought on prosody is likely to have been influenced by the Latin tradition. To a greater extent than has been anticipated, we therefore need to reckon with the possibility of a two-way dialogue between the ancient Greek and Latin grammatical traditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings open up possibilities for further work on interactions between the Greek and Latin grammatical traditions, and especially for extending the work beyond prosody to other areas of grammar.

As part of this project, a working group on the long-term histories of grammatical traditions is pooling its knowledge of numerous different grammatical traditions in order to identify processes that occur readily in very different cultural settings, and others that are tied to particular cultural circumstances. More specifically, the group is working on a typology of mechanisms by which grammatical words change their meanings over the long-term history of a grammatical tradition. For the most part, we claim that this typology looks like a typology of mechanisms by which any other words change their meanings, but we also find some possibilities that appear specific to grammatical words. Our typology will be interpretable as a challenge to other researchers: can further possibilities be identified?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FCBFDFA6-5BE1-442F-8F65-89BBB2FC51DC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dee255e64633.26657221</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M011291/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>670B21EC-383C-4A51-856D-14A82FAE3EC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language Variation &amp; Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0CBBED5C-44FC-4F3D-9A21-8E5A3B7AC8F1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>29000EBB-2E17-48B1-A0F8-87862EF36D2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistic Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>60F1052E-AB14-4791-A5BB-5B185323298B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Morphology &amp; Phonology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
