While this repertoire seems initially to stand outside the main conflict zone of Western/Soviet modernism, no music was regarded as ideologically neutral in the Soviet Union, and composers such as J.S. Bach, Mozart and Beethoven all had to bear a degree of political scrutiny. In some cases, as with Renaissance and Baroque sacred music, bans eventually came into place to block further performance, while a sacred work such as Mozart's Requiem could be performed throughout the whole Soviet period. Initially collating performance data and writings on reception, this project will focus on three major areas: the removal of most sacred music from Soviet repertoire and its gradual reinstatement in the 1960s and 70s; the targeting of proletarian groups with Western 'classical' music in the 1920s and 30s, and an overall analysis of the 'Classics for the Masses' project in the Soviet period. The reception of major figures from Western music history such as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner is of the greatest value in assessing how Soviet culture evolved in response to the Western music traditions that still dominated the Russian concert hall. Since militant calls to reject past culture in the 1920s were ignored by policy-makers, the most pressing question was how bourgeois Western art music should be regarded: as a necessary phase in the historical advance to socialism; as anachronistic and irrelevant, or as a precious relic that should be preserved and shared with the masses? Acceptance or rejection of certain repertoire was, not surprisingly, shaped by wider political forces. An obvious example is Wagner - initially favoured as a revolutionary composer, his operas were abruptly dropped after the Second World War. But other changes in repertoire selection occurred for less obvious reasons, and identifying what these were is an important part of this project. The Moscow and Leningrad Philharmonias issued audience questionnaires at certain concerts, which could have several implications: were they required to do this in order to justify their choice of repertoire, or were they simply canvassing opinion from specific social groups, which they identified from the selected subscription series? Nothing is currently known about why some composers and works remained in the repertoire undisturbed from 1917-1991 while some were quietly dropped or banned, and this research will address that gap in our knowledge.\n\nThe wider implications of the project are significant. It will explore the complex relationship between a self-consciously new culture and the old on which it was based, and on which it initially depended entirely. In so doing, it will investigate how the Soviet regime 'managed' something as apparently innocuous as mainstream concert repertoire as a way of asserting control over its Western heritage. It will also explore the relationship between the custodians of 'high art' and the proletarian groups: how repertoire was selected as suitable for them as a way of building up their level of culture while distracting them from the popular culture that was less 'improving', less easy to monitor and control and which was therefore more potentially subversive. The research will also assess the conflicts of interest between those in positions of power and influence who sincerely wished to share the music that they believed was the rightful heritage of the Soviet proletariat, and those who wished to use that heritage to more direct political ends. This might include a degree of enforcement, including the Philharmonias' 'outreach' activities in factories and clubs, or the aggressive assertion of Romantic and Classical models for Soviet composers as a way of steering themfrom the dangers of Western modernism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are beneficiaries of this research beyond academia. Two of the edited books are in very broad fields that appeal to a wide public audience: Music and Politics and The Oxford Handbook of Music Censorship. Both these areas are in the category of 'general' as well as specialised musical interest. Neither publication demands a specialised knowledge of Soviet music (or even music) in order to be understood by a general public; they are not technical volumes, but are intended for a wide interested readership as well as a scholarly one. Even if interested individuals do not buy the books, they are very likely to use them online (in electronic format) or in libraries. They are also publications likely to be consulted by the media. Students of Soviet music and cultural history will also benefit, and this covers a large number of students in music, history and Slavic Studies departments not only throughout the UK but also right across the Western scholarly field. But aside from the potential academic/student readership, there is considerable media and popular interest in the field of Soviet (especially Shostakovich) studies. There is a very broad international public market for Soviet music research: this is fuelled by interest in major composers such as Shostakovich and Prokofiev, but it extends to the broader context for their music. There is also an active public market for studies of Soviet culture: popular historical books by major historians on Soviet life and culture (for example, those by Shelia Fitzpatrick, Orlando Figes, Catherine Merridale) are to be found in station bookshops, and their work is widely disseminated in the media. My research will feed directly into this body of public interest, and will, with time, be widely disseminated through similar media channels. Though I cannot state conclusively at this point what those channels will be, the extent of public interest in this field is such that major research findings are quite quickly disseminated into a public arena.\n\nHow will they benefit?\nIndividual readers and students will benefit from the dissemination of research in books that will be bought by public and university libraries and will in the future be available online (Ashgate, the publisher of Music and Politics, are developing an online catalogue of academic books). The journal article will also be available online, through the JSTOR service. I will provide links to published outputs from my personal academic website.\n\nWhat will be done?\nThis research will also be disseminated in public lectures and conference papers: the first public lecture will be at the University of Bristol Department of Music in 2011 and others will follow as this strand of my research develops. I have already given several public lectures and seminars on the topic of my first output from this project (seminars at Durham, Surrey and Bristol universities and a public lecture at the Aleksanteri Institute in Helsinki) and my work on these related areas of workers' musical education and religious music will bear similar fruit.\n \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65335</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Don't Sing it on a Feast Day: the performance of Western sacred music in the USSR</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>98DFD584-8C81-404A-84A6-8296B04E637B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PUblic lecture given at the Department of Music, University of Manchester</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6084729205.8958950bd46392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Don't Sing it on a Feast Day: the performance of Western sacred music in the USSR</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>3E809CF4-266F-44A8-94A0-7FB635F10282</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture given in the Victoria Rooms, University of Bristol</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2754236723.0674590c10d642</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Don't Sing it on a Feast Day: the performance of Western sacred music in the USSR</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>B32C9003-D174-40C5-9A29-9BE525F607E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>John Bird Lecture, Department of Music, University of Cardiff</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5316326027.0993470bd471fc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Don't Sing it on a Feast Day: the performance of Western sacred music in the USSR</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5B4B053-8467-4425-9F4C-B58CFBE71E95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PUblic seminar, Institute for Musical Research, Senate House, University of London</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5341329495.740430bd82644</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I have given a number of public lectures on the research I carried out during the period of my grant.
