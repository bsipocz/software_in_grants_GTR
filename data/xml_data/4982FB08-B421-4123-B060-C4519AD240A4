The rising levels of allergies are a serious cause for concern within the European Union, especially in children. Allergic diseases affect between 10-20% of the population and usually start during infancy, childhood or adolescence, and up to 5% children have food allergy (www.foodallergy.org). Food allergies are more prevalent in children, due to an immature gastrointestinal epithelial membrane barrier, allowing more proteins through the barrier and into circulation. Allergy to egg is one of the major allergies in infants and young children. This project will involve studies that could provide important information about how to manage egg proteins hypersensitivity. Modification of proteins by transglutaminase is thought to have beneficial effects on their allergenic properties. Through improved understanding of this effect, we aim to develop strategies for enzymatically modifying the major egg allergens such as ovalbumin and ovomucoid with transglutaminase to reduce the immunoreactivity of these proteins. To achieve this we require a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together the following key skills and expertise: 1. Biochemistry skills and expertise are required to modify ovalbumin and ovomucoid using transglutaminase and to evaluate the antigenicity (ability of a protein or a peptide to bind an antibody) and the allergenicity of the modified forms. 2.Physiological expertise is required to define and develop accurate models of protein digestion which are representative of the in vivo situation. In particular models that are relevant to the infant gut where egg allergy is developed. 3.Immunological skill to use both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to study the persistence of potential epitopes through simulated digestion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>These results suggest a possible use of transglutaminase-modified ovalbumin in the food industry as a potential ingredient to enhance both the functional properties of many food-based products, such as digestibility, and mechanical properties, such as viscoelasticity and gel strength.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>354E850A-CBF4-4CC0-99CC-0360D443ABC3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544fb132609ef8.90767573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>EGGALL has made use of rheological tools to investigate the effect of mTG on the viscoelastic properties of egg protein gels. Secondly simulated digestion experiments under gastric and duodenal conditions were carried out on unmodified and mTG-modified samples that had undergone a range of processing conditions. Furthermore, by using an enzymatic approach, based on the enzyme Peptide-N4-(acetyl-b-glucosaminyl) asparagines amidase (PNGase F), Dr Giosafatto was able to fully deglycosylate the ovomucoid protein. The important finding of a synergism between sulfhydryl reagent, surfactants and heating suggests that similar approaches could also be applied for the deglycosylation different glycoproteins, in which the glycans are responsible of their immunological properties. This is generating renewed scientific interest due to the growing social and economic consequences of the allergy crisis in the developed world. The design of healthier foods to control the allergy is a top priority in the EU: it is estimated that treating allergy and related conditions takes up to 7% of the total healthcare budget within the EU. EGGALL has shown that fundamental science can reveal that an enzymatic approach, based on the enzyme mTG can change the digestibility and rheological properties of proteins.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These results suggest a possible use of transglutaminase-modified ovalbumin in the food industry as a potential ingredient to enhance both the functional properties of many food-based products, such as digestibility, and mechanical properties, such as viscoelasticity and gel strength.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B0B66968-27CF-41D5-B4F8-A09C0CCEE1C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fb242a2df45.03330650</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>449497FD-8F27-49A1-A205-7458B6D59403</gtr:id><gtr:title>Microbial transglutaminase-mediated modification of ovalbumin</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food Hydrocolloids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/49cd4d8332718ddcac8c06395493fff2"><gtr:id>49cd4d8332718ddcac8c06395493fff2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giosafatto C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5459fcdf75e7f9.16029944</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4F81C680-6A11-4BAE-948C-C79531184504</gtr:id><gtr:title>Enzymatic cross-linking of &amp;Icirc;&amp;sup2;-lactoglobulin in solution and at air&amp;acirc;??water interface: Structural constraints</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food Hydrocolloids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/758cd8d95b450fbe1a5abd51d80846af"><gtr:id>758cd8d95b450fbe1a5abd51d80846af</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ercili-Cura D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5459fcdf9ea385.08373605</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00042544</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
