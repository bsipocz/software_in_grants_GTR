The opposite is also true however, as urban renewal, major infrastructure and monumental architectural projects are all invested by planners and policy-makers with the expectation that they will redeem depressed areas and renew the social and physical fabric of neighbourhoods and communities: again, this also applies to the past. Though firmly based in the context and experience of Early Modern Europe, this project seeks to view the process of urban change as witnessed along streets, with a comparative perspective offered by contemporary practice and experience. In relation to the public space of streets, we will consider these major themes: the relation between ephemeral performances and permanent urban change; the performative siting of violence, punishment and protest; surveillance, policing and control; gossip and the circulation of news; street sounds. The network aims at an historical understanding of contemporary problems concerning street culture, by addressing issues that could also help reframe current issues, thus feeding into public policy. This objective will also be advanced by the network's varied constituencies and the involvement of our project partners, CABE (Commission for Architecture and Built Environment). \n\nThe network is led by Fabrizio Nevola, whose previous work on Early Modern Siena (Siena: Constructing the Renaissance City, New Haven and London 2007 and co-author of the exhibition catalogue of the National Gallery's recent Renaissance Siena: Art for a City) is characterised by an interdisciplinary approach to the urban environment. He is currently engaged in a new comparative research project that considers the interaction between commerce, urbanism and palace architecture in Early Modern Italy, in which streets are a key factor. It is planned that the network will create a vibrant research community that will look at new methodologies by bringing together historians, art historians, architectural historians, cultural anthropologists, social geographers, architects, urban planners, performers and artists, to discuss the social and physical environment of the street in a cross-disciplinary manner and across a broad chronological sweep.\n\nThe Street life and street culture network will meet eight times over a two year period. The place and form of the meetings will vary. The first will be in Oxford, where the team will invite a number of speakers and respondents from cultural anthropology, the professions of architecture and planning, and local community services. It will include an on-site visit/seminar based around the Cowley Road. The objective will be to explore shared interests and agendas that inform our historical study with contemporary debates on 'street culture'. Subsequently there will be three workshops/symposia, again with outside speakers, that address specific themes of the project / the temporary and ephemeral use of urban space, violence/conflict/control, and gossip/information/sound. The network team will hold an overseas meeting in Siena which is scheduled to coincide with the Palio, an event where the city's physical and social fabric interact in a way that is both traditional and contemporary. This will include a seminar with cultural anthropologists and local administrators. We also plan to hold a sponsored session at the annual conference of the American Society of Architectural Historians. The final conference in London will present our findings with a broad range of speakers and respondents</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49963</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Research form this project fed into a further funded piece of work (AH/K005138/1) which created a public-facing smartphone app.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>136CC253-5797-4762-9088-6B8BC26DAA70</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b3368a9d49c6.76241137</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Street life and street culture network (AH/G000417/1) has set out to build an international team of scholars with shared research interests in the interdisciplinary study of urban culture; in particular the relationship between the built environment and the social fabric of Early Modern and contemporary cities. The result has been a dynamic discourse between specialists from historical and non-historical disciplines that has linked the historic past to the present. Indeed, since the public urban life of the pre-Modern Mediterranean world has frequently been held up as a model for the socially engaged, publicly-staged idea of community, we have also aimed to test the potential for such cross-chronological comparisons. While textual evidence is a crucial tool for the historian, the environment of the street (visual, aural, theatrical, architectural, political) has been the principal object of our study, and as such is 'beyond text'.
This was a network, and the prime focus of our activity has been to initiate the creation and consolidation of a core research group. We accomplished this through a series of events over a period of 2 years, details of which can be found on the network website (www.bath.ac.uk/ace/Streetlife/). In some respects, the most important finding of our network is that there is considerable scope for useful cross-chronological and interdisciplinary research on the network's theme. Since a concern of the original AHRC reviewers had been that &amp;quot;it would be a fortunate accident rather than a predictable outcome&amp;quot; that a fruitful dialogue might be set up between scholars and practitioners from Early Modern and contemporary fields, it is worth underlining that this has been achieved from the outset. Feedback from our study days and conference - from audience and participants - repeatedly underlined enthusiasm, interest and positive comments on the innovative and successful nature of this cross-chronological dialogue. It should be underlined that CI and PI worked very hard to ensure the selection of open-minded and creative contributors for the network events, which thus enabled the goal of a fruitful discussion on selected themes to work effectively.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For the first two years of the project (the PI and CI won a further year's funding to continue and develop the network) , the network activities have been confined to our core team and workshop participants. Our network had CABE (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment) as a project partner, and Louise Duggan, leader of CABE Space attended our meeting in November 2008; CABE also offered collaboration in our Small Project proposal, which did not get funding. 

As regards local government services and other public bodies, while the PI was based at Oxford Brookes we involved the Neighbourhood Services Manager from Oxford City Council, although this collaboration ended after the PI's move to Bath. Our 'surveillance' event (March 2010) held at the University of Bath had two participants from the Bath and North West Somerset Council. We have again explored the possibility of further development with such participants in the policy-engagement continuation of the project with the follow-on-funding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>51F445EA-B464-447B-955C-1B58592C3096</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b343099783b5.13817932</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/ace/Streetlife/Streetlife_index/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G000417/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>2BC7804C-63E1-4BF8-9DBD-A79F62106DAF</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/G000417/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>49963.0</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2009-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>6071717E-8B02-4731-8EB4-C21D9852802C</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/G000417/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>42834.78</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
