Trajectories</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/E509681/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Context 1968 is a common reference point in contemporary society, standing either as a golden moment of radical change, now vanished, or a time of damaging experiments, now fortunately rooted out. Although the debate has gone on since 1968 itself, there is far less scholarly literature on this subject than on the Second World War or Cold War periods in Europe. The project embraces the challenge to historicise the years around 1968, no longer to make political capital out of them, but to reassess the moment as a turning point in the history of the twentieth century. 

The project is the first centrally-conceived fully European transnational approach to this topic. Previous comparative studies have either been single-authored works covering only part of Europe, or conference proceedings, by their nature disparate. It will be undertaken by an international research team a dozen strong, built around a core of four researchers who have been working together for five years on a project funded by the European Science Foundation on daily Life in German- and Italian-occupied Europe, published by Berg in June 2006, led by Professor Robert Gildea, Professor of Modern History elect at the University of Oxford. The AHRC research grant is intended to fund primary research by the six UK-based members of the project. They will collaborate with six other European scholars in workshops scheduled for 2007, 2008 and 2009, for which funding has been sought from the Leverhulme Trust. It will link into a project directed by Anette Warring, professor of History at Roskilde University, Denmark, and funded by the Danish Humanities Research council, on Utopia and social criticism in Denmark. The team brings together professors, lecturers and postdoctoral scholars in a path-breaking and exciting enterprise of international research and collaboration. 

The project will implement a radical new framework of analysis around the three vectors of activism, networks and trajectories. It will investigate activism by means of a collective biography of activists, but shift the focus from the stars or 'mountain crest' of activists, professional '68s who made careers in politics or the media on the back of their 1968 activities, to a wide cross-section of rank-and-file militants and experimenters. It will rescue the study of the activities of 1968 from sociologists who have conceived of them in terms of 'movements' to focus on clusters of often informal activist networks in each country, networks ranging from the overtly political to those such as communes which experimented with new life-styles. Finally, it will challenge broad narratives which model a shift around 1968 from Utopian dreams to radicalism or from failed revolution to broader cultural revolution, by tracing the trajectories of individual activists between 1965 and 1975 and deriving conclusions from the patterns that emerge. 

Wider significance and benefits The project will build a data-base of activists and networks in thirteen European countries and undertake interviews with a broad sample of activists to provide the evidence for the present study and a unique resource for future researchers. The project will have and interactive and interdisciplinary dimension, with two former activists and two sociologists invited to make contributions to the 2008 workshop. The outcome of the project will be primarily academic, but members of the team will generate and participate in a wider public debate commemorating the 40&amp;quot;&amp;quot; anniversary of 1968 in 2008, on the significance of 1968 and the years around it in twentieth-century European history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>567331</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of G?ttingen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Generation Research Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Generation Research Studies programme at G&amp;ouml;ttingen, headed by Professor Bernd Weisbrot, organised by Anna von der Goltz.</gtr:description><gtr:id>556193BE-60C4-46DC-8473-33889DA200DB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95bfefab95bff0e-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Information taken from Final Report</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bielefeld University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with research programmes at University of Bielefeld on 'The Political as Communicative Space in History' and 'Ways of Constructing the Self, headed by Professor Ingrid Gilcher-Holtey.</gtr:description><gtr:id>32AFDDAF-60AF-445B-9ABE-7189DA23FE05</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95d990eb95d9922-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Information taken from Final Report</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College Dublin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for War Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>A TRANSNATIONAL APPROACH TO RESISTANCE IN EUROPE, 1936-48</gtr:description><gtr:id>C6210150-B4E7-4535-8F52-5C34B85981C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b95853b8b95853cc-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>International expertise on the different perspectives of the project</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project aims to re-evaluate and recast the history of resistance to hegemonic and occupying empires in

Database

The project has provided a large, diverse and high-quality resource of interviews conducted in 2007-10 with 475 former activists belonging to 106 research networks in 14 European countries. This may be accessed by researchers wishing to use oral testimony to further their understanding of political and lifestyle radicalism around 1968.





2. A European '68

The project contributes significantly to our understanding of Europe's 1968 in both comparative and transnational terms.

Comparatively, it is path-breaking in the sense that it opens a whole new field of research in countries such as Greece, Spain, Hungary and the USSR, which were not previously identified with the events around 1968. It has also brought into focus 'other '68s' outside the mainstream of political and lifestyle radicals, such as radical Christian activists, gay activists and Soviet hippies. It has reached significant conclusions about the nature of activism around 1968 in different parts of Europe. It investigated whether activism was predominantly lifestyle' in democratic northern Europe and more straightforwardly political in the dictatorships of southern Europe (The Colonels' Greece and Franco's Spain). Differences between West and East Europe divided by the Cold War have also been shown to be significant. For example, the revolutionary, anti-imperialist nature of western imperialism was not obviously echoed by activists in the Communist bloc whose regimes were officially revolutionary and anti-imperialist, although activists in the East evolved their own versions of revolution and anti-imperialism. 



In transnational terms, the use of oral testimony and focus on networks allowed us to trace - in some cases for the first time - the precise links between radicals across the continent, sometimes as political exiles. It enabled us to explore how different groups in different cultures understood - or often misunderstood - each other in matters as diverse as revolts against the family and solidarity with the 'third world'.

3. The oral history approach

The project is the first oral-history approach to 1968 since Ronald Fraser's 1968. A Student Generation in Revolt (1988). Our study made three contributions. First, it traced ways in which ordinary individuals subjectively construct themselves as activists and their path into activism. These narratives may confirm or challenge the concept of 1968 as a 'generational revolt' and highlights the way in which generational tension was both political and personal. Second, it reconstructed the informal social and political networks formed by individual activists, bringing to consciousness positive memories of collective experience and negative memories of conflicts over ideas, values and tactics together with feelings of inclusion and exclusion from groups. Third, it explored ways in which former activist entered into dialogue with and define themselves against the collective memories or master-narratives of the wider society. These master-narratives are generally of two kinds, a celebratory one of liberation both individual and social, or a condemnatory one of a descent into chaos, whether of private hedonism or political violence. The study explores the diverse ways in which, forty years on, radicals from across the continent have sought to make sense of their radicalism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has engaged decisively with the oral history community, which is at the interface between academic and non-academic (notable local and community-project based) practitioners. Robert Gildea and Rebecca Clifford gave a joint presentation on activism and gender in France and Italy to the Oral History Society conference in Glasgow in 2009. Robert Gildea published his 2008 inaugural lecture, 'The Long March of Oral History: Around 1968 in France', in Oral History 38/1 (Spring 2010). 

The project provides an excellent research for political campaigners or activists from a younger generation, who have much to learn from engagement with the histories of the movements and methods of the generations of 1968. Publicity was been given to the project's initial findings during the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of 1968 in 2008. Robert Gildea published '1968 in 2008' in History Today 58/5 (May 2008). Sheila Rowbotham, historian and former 1968 activist, who has acted adviser to the project since its inception, has made a number of public appearances to publicise our findings. Recent student agitation stimulated media interest in the project. Sean Coughlan's 'Looking back with the 1968 rebels' on the BBC News website on 2 Sept. 2011 drew heavily on our findings and interviews. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14277114. When interest in 1968 revives for the 50th anniversary in 2018 our resources will be at the disposal of interested parties.



Since the project involved seven UK-based and seven non-UK-based historians, the project has had a significant impact on debates around public participation across Europe. In Denmark Anette Warring organised two witness seminars with former 1968 activists, providing a public forum for former activists to meet and discuss their experiences and about their meaning today. The witness seminar of 24 January 2007 was attended by the influential Politisk Revy (Political Review). In East Germany and Hungary the process of interviewing has informed public debate, demonstrating to former activists that they are the subject of historical interest and lending support to the view that these countries are part of the global 1968 narrative. In Poland Piotr Oseka has received support from the Polish History Museum in Warsaw and will make his contributions available to the public there through the Museum.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9CD0522D-6250-4A73-A684-0AD94743E024</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6978829071.8373187763770e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>database of interviews (audio and transcriptions) with 475 former activists, organised in 106 activist networks and 14 European countries, recorded by research team between 2007 and 2010.
