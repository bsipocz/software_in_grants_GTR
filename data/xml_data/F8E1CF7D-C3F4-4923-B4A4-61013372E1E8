The project encompasses public interventions, photographic prints, video &amp;amp; performance work, one-to-one interactions &amp;amp; a commission for an interactive internet-based project. The work has received wide critical attention &amp;amp; been exhibited extensively internationally. In 2007 photos of Marcus Fisher will be shown at the Brooklyn Museum, NYC, as part of a large retrospective, 'Global Feminisms'. \nAfter exploring images and fictional narratives based on the Eastern European Jew, I want to develop new research exploring Jewish narratives originating outside the west. In recent years the comparative invisibility of Oriental Jews in relation to their western counterparts has been challenged in various cultural productions. \nThe fellowship proposes creatively to explore Oriental Jewish narratives &amp;amp; their reciprocal relations to the Arab &amp;amp; Islamic world. The research will look at the life of three enigmatic oriental male historical figures: Sarmad the Saint, a 17th century Jewish merchant who became a Sufi saint; Shabtai Zvi, also known as the false messiah, who embraced Islam under threat; and the significant Jewish scholar, the Rambam, considered by some an Arab thinker, who wrote the 'Guide to the Perplexed' in Arabic. The research proposes to investigate western Victorian pictorial &amp;amp; photographic representations of Oriental Jews &amp;amp; will include reading around Orientalism, performance &amp;amp; interculturalism. \nThis research will form the basis for producing high quality interdisciplinary work developing multiple fictional Oriental Jewish characters &amp;amp; narratives &amp;amp; their relation to the Arab &amp;amp; Muslim world. The work will include photographic prints featuring Arab &amp;amp; Jewish characters in performative settings, a graphic novel made collaboratively with a Palestinian artist featuring two relevant superheroes, and a performance/video based on Sarmad's life, partly in collaboration with QMUL students.\nAs the bitter conflict in Israel/Palestine remains &amp;amp; polarisation between the Jewish/Israeli/Western world and the Arab/Islamic world grows, I will research Jewish history that had a reciprocal cultural relationship to the Arab world, will work collaboratively with Palestinian professionals I know &amp;amp; will contribute to cultural networks &amp;amp; collaborations already in existence that bring together Jewish, Arab &amp;amp; Palestinian individuals &amp;amp; communities. \nThe proposed research has significant connections to research interests of staff in the School &amp;amp; resonates strongly with its politically invested ethos. As such I envisage many forms of critical and creative exchange. The research will contribute to the School through workshops at QMUL, a symposium focused on the subject of alter egos &amp;amp; fictional characters where I will present a second paper, &amp;amp; collaboration with students on aspects of the video work. \nI will also undertake structured research into other UK-based performative art works that explore alter egos &amp;amp; fictional characters, particularity works that mobilise notions of identity, are related to contested social &amp;amp; political realities &amp;amp; make meaningful connections between artist and character. The project wil be disseminated widely through papers, workshops, exhibitions, performances &amp;amp; screenings, a graphic novel, and a symposium.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240760</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E003273/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
