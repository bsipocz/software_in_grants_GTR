It keeps a central position in Mathematics to this day, and has found numerous applications in Biology, Chemistry, Information Technology and especially in Theoretical Physics. For instance, it was Representation Theory that gave mathematical foundations to the celebrated prediction made in 1964 by P. Higgs (Nobel Prize 2013) and confirmed by CERN experimenters in 2012. 


Reciprocally, Physics also remains a major source of inspiration for Representation Theory. This is particularly relevant to the present project, which is aimed to study certain algebraic objects emerged from the Theory of Integrable Systems and from the Quantum Field Theory. These algebraic objects were discovered around 1992 by I. Cherednik, who then used them to prove the famous conjectures of I. Macdonald on multivariate orthogonal polynomials. Since then these algebras have become the focus of attention of many world leading mathematicians, and found striking applications in Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorics and Mathematical Physics. We aim to advance the theory of these algebras by using the methods coming from the theory of affine Lie algebras.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The theory of Cherednik algebras is at the cutting edge of the modern Representation Theory. The proposed project will help to maintain the good health of this branch of Mathematics in the UK and its worldwide competitiveness. There is already a number of ongoing research projects in the UK involving Cherednik algebras and related objects. Several of them are supported by the EPSRC and other funders. However, to the best of the PI knowledge this proposal is unique in offering deep structural and combinatorial analysis of those representations of Cherednik algebras that are most difficult to study, namely those where a certain distinguished family of pairwise commuting elements act non-semisimply.

The Algebra group at York is a constituent of the Anglo-Franco-German Representation Theory network supported by an EPSRC research grant, and of the Algebra and Representation Theory In the North (ARTIN) network in the UK supported by a rolling Scheme 3 Grant from the London Mathematical Society and by the Glasgow Mathematical Journal Trust. A meeting of ARTIN is proposed as a integral part of this project. Research contacts through both networks will help to carry out the proposed research, and to disseminate its results. They will also help to recruit the best available candidate as the project RA.

To ensure that the expected academic impact is fully achieved, we will actively promote, explain and publicise our work to as broad and varied academic audience as possible, for the duration of and after the proposed research. This will entail discussions with other experts in the area, seminar talks and conference presentations in UK and abroad. At the same time we will ensure that all our preprints are freely available, and get them published in internationally leading journals. We will also seek and embrace opportunities to promote this research to non-academic audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>193805</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We discovered a new connection between two different mathematical objects</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project is still running.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7CC19E0B-0EED-40FD-B105-1C69D91DAD1B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a48bcaa37b89.50415399</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N023919/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
