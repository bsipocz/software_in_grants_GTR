An important tool to achieve this is high resolution simulation modelling of chronic and acute contamination. While the overheads involved in building and running such models are largely beyond SMEs involved in such work, NERC has invested strongly in ocean modelling and this presents an opportunity for collaboration and the extracting of added value from our research. Within GOBLIN, we propose - in conjunction with our industrial partners - to develop existing simulation output into a format that is both appropriate for and available to industrial stakeholders. To achieve this, we will produce data visualisations of our fine-scale global ocean model, and create a data portal that will allow access to the underlying simulated circulation. These outputs of GOBLIN will be showcased at the international &amp;quot;Ocean Business&amp;quot; exhibition in 2015, and supported by a parallel workshop that will introduce them to potential new partners in industry. In conjunction with these activities, GOBLIN proposes to learn from engaging with this sector to adopt protocols for simulations and model output that best map to industry requirements. The intention of GOBLIN is, firstly, to show stakeholders what NERC is able to provide, and, secondly, to provide a forum for engagement to adapt future NERC efforts to best complement industry needs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98783</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We develop a methodology which would lead to reduced risk and a better response to oil spills through improved situational awareness.

Despite the high impact of such events, only little research effort has gone into understanding subsurface pathways of oil plumes in the deep ocean. With ongoing deep sea drilling and with recent technological advancements in offshore oil and gas exploration and production allowing to access ever deeper and more remote locations, there is a pressing need to have the capability to assess the expected pathways of oil spills from any existing or potential future deep ocean drilling sites. In the present project we concentrated on the Atlantic Ocean, to demonstrate the significance of the problem and to offer potential solutions. Using a leading edge, high resolution numerical global ocean circulation model we present examples demonstrating (a) the importance of the ocean circulation in the propagation of potential oil spills; (b) likely circulation footprints for oil spills at four key locations in the Atlantic Ocean off the shelves of Brazil, the Gulf of Guinea, the Gulf of Mexico and in the Faroe Shetland Channel. We show that high seasonal and inter-annual variability of the ocean circulation means that for a blowout occurring at a given location in the ocean, the oil spill trajectory can vary substantially - both in terms of direction and spatial extent of the oil spill. The approach utilised in this study was developed as a result of ongoing collaboration between academia and industry within a dedicated knowledge exchange project. The methodology we adopted in this study complements the oil spill modelling preparedness studies usually performed by environmental consultancies by addressing the uncertainty in oil spill spread and footprint resulting from the variability of the ocean circulation. If adopted more widely, such an approach would lead to reduced risk and a better response through improved situational awareness.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>If adopted more widely, the approach we developed would lead to reduced risk and a better response to oil spills through improved situational awareness.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2316ADDE-1A3F-48BB-80F2-6E2D0126B169</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e04987568317.05861857</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The methodology we developed in this study complements the oil spill modelling preparedness studies usually performed by environmental consultancies by addressing the uncertainty in oil spill spread and footprint resulting from the variability of the ocean circulation.
