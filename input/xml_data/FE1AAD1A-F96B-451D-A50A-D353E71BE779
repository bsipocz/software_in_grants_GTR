Not only is the brain a major target in primary, genetically determined mitochondrial disease, but mitochondrial dysfunction is also a prominent feature in many of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's dementia (AD). For instance, AD is characterized by the accumulation of the Amyloid beta (A-beta) peptide as plaques in the neuropil. Recent work has demonstrated the presence of A-beta in the inner compartment of
mitochondria. The mitochondrial fraction of A-beta is quantitatively digested by the pitrilysin metallopeptidase 1 (PITRM1).
PITRM1 (also known as presequence peptidase, PreP) is a 117kDa mitochondrial matrix enzyme, which is also deemed to be responsible for digesting the mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) of proteins imported across the inner
mitochondrial membrane, that are cleaved from the mature polypeptides by the mitochondrial matrix peptidase (MMP).
Typically, these peptides, located at the N-terminus of mitochondrion-targeted proteins, are amphiphilic species, with a polar, positively charged, arginine-rich side, opposite to an apolar side. Therefore, if these peptides fail to be cleared from the mitochondrial matrix, they may act as detergent-like, toxic agents, forming pores in the membranes and resulting in uncoupling and dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta-P). Interestingly, the accumulation of A-beta
peptides has been shown to inhibit the activity of CYM1, the PITRM1 orthologue in yeast, leading to impaired MTS processing, and accumulation of precursor proteins. We have recently found the first family carrying a missense mutation
in PITRM1 associated with a slowly progressive neurodegenerative phenotype (Brunetti et al, Embo Mol Med 2015).
Investigations in vitro and human cells, as well as in yeast and mouse models, has allowed us to make progress in the elucidation of the disease mechanism. In particular, we have investigated a Pitrm1 knock-out mouse line. Whilst the
constitutive Pitrm1-/- genotype is associated with embryonic lethality, Pitrm1+/- heterozygotes survive to adulthood, but the Pitrm1 levels are well under 50% in brain and liver, and approximately 60% in skeletal muscle, compared to Pitrm1+/+
littermates. Interestingly, from the age of 2 months Pitrm1+/- mice develop hindlimb clasping, followed by progressive impairment in motor coordination, general proprioception, explorative behaviour, and basal-ganglia related movement control. Metabolic assessment revealed significantly reduced O2 consumption and CO2 production, and reduced heat
generation. Post-mortem analysis demonstrated the presence of age-dependent accumulation of both Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and A-beta(1-42)-immunoreactive areas. No such lesions were ever found in any brain specimen from
Pitrm1+/+ littermates. The observation that the hemizygous Pitrm1+/- mouse displays slowly progressive, multisystem neurological impairment, suggests that not only recessive variants, but also dominant or sporadic loss-of-function mutations
in PITRM1, leading to haploinsufficiency, could be associated with adult-onset neurodegeneration, possibly characterized, as in the mouse, by accumulation of APP and A-beta deposits. Our findings offer for the first time a strong, mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction and misfolded protein aggregates in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. The present proposal, termed Mito-ND (for Mitochondrial Neurodegeneration), will test whether PITRM1 variants are associated with human amyloidotic neurodegeneration, including AD, and will contribute to elucidate the long-debated, but still unresolved, involvement of mitochondrial proteostasis in these conditions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_EX_MR/P007031/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
