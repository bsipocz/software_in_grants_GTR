Psalter</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/G00028X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>For the very first time the eight surviving Part-books that comprise the Wode Psalter will be brought from Washington, Dublin, London and Edinburgh to be seen together in exhibition during the 2011 Edinburgh International Festival. The Psalter will also be heard: a selection of music from the Psalter will be performed in two concerts and recorded on disc. \n\nThese music manuscripts offer an ideal mirror for reflecting the multi-faceted world of Reformation Britain. In addition to their music, they reveal new insights about religious worship and devotion, poetry, painting, patronage and material culture as well as providing an illustrated diary written during the reigns of Mary, Queen of Scots, and James VI and I. \n\nThe Part-books were compiled between 1562 and 1592 by Thomas Wode, vicar of St Andrews, to contain four-part settings of metrical psalms, though other songs and instrumental music were also added. Wode's efforts placed Scotland within the strong European Reformed tradition of psalm-singing; he also helped preserve the literary and musical compositions of English radical reformers which were rejected within the established Church of England.\n\nThe major musical significance of the manuscripts, which provide the sole source for most of their contents, has long been recognised but the Georgetown University Part-book has only recently become known and its music not fully incorporated. However, scholars from other disciplines have been slow to exploit the Psalter's many and varied treasures. As a consequence, the Wode Psalter presents an excellent multi-disciplinary focus for scholarly endeavour and one that unites researchers from different institutional backgrounds. It also offers an ideal medium for public engagement with the world of Reformation Britain, allowing it to be seen and heard in physical and electronic formats.\n\nPrior to the exhibition and feeding into its interpretative framework, a virtual research forum will facilitate the compilation of a research agenda for the Psalter. The forum mounted on the password-protected area of the project website will call upon the scholars and practitioners interested in working with the Psalter who have been brought into the specially-created academic network. Four online workshops using digital images from the Part-books and short commissioned articles to stimulate discussion will examine the Psalter's religious, literary and musical aspects and Wode's 'illustrated diary'. A final workshop will consider the Psalter in its entirety. \n\nThough the exhibition and concerts will be transitory, the project's legacy will be permanent. A CD of the Psalter's music will be commercially available so the Part-books can continue to be heard and the Psalter seen in printed form through the exhibition booklet. The online legacy will include an educational pack consisting of a research-skills online seminar on the theme of Thomas Wode and his 'musical diary'. The open access area of the project website will also host the specially-designed permanently available webpages containing a selection of digital images from the Psalter and material drawn from the exhibition and the virtual research forum. \n\nIn these varied ways the Wode Psalter will allow the world of Reformation Britain to be seen and heard once again. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Wode Collection: 16c music by Scottish, English &amp;amp; Continental Composers

A travelling version of the Singing the Reformation exhibition was taken to Dundee and was the centrepiece of a series of events over two days 5-6 Nov 2011. The Wode Psalter IPhone App was in considerable demand as an additional visual and aural aid.The extensive church premises at Meadowside St Paul's Church in the middle of Dundee provided room for a large exhibition and for refreshments for those visiting on Saturday and Sunday 5 and 6 Nov 2011. This was a collaborative venture supported by the minister and kirk session who saw it as part of their outreach to the community and it also brought in passers by from the city centre in Dundee especially on Saturday afternoon. The church publicised the event, their choir and choirmaster led the psalm-singing, they provided all the refreshments and facilities and helped assemble and dismantle the exhibition. On Sunday people came from across Fife and Angus as well as Perth and Dundee to participate and they took away the new musical scores. 
2. A specialised stitching workshop 'Stitch the Reformation' was held in Killearn Stirlingshire to introduce members of the Embroiderers Guild to the particular blackwork and other 16th century stitching and embroidery techniques used to create the four stitched exhibits in the Singing the Reformation exhibition by Mrs Nancy Bailey. A visual display, the music from the Wode Collection CD and the Wode Psalter IPhone App were available throughout the day-long workshop and Prof Dawson provided the historical background to the stitching. The working on the stitching examples [especially the 'biscornu'] enriched the experience and knowledge of members of the Embroiderers Guild [key transmitters to national and local groups of knowledge in this field] concerning sixteenth-century blackwork and its relevance and beauty for today. 
3. A travelling exhibition of Singing the Reformation was taken to Belfast where it was displayed at an academic conference on 13 April [Language, literature and liturgy] and at a public psalm singing event on 14 April. This changed the way in which those who attended the event understood their own heritage of metrical psalm singing in Northern Ireland.
4. The musical scores for the metrical psalms that have been made available via the Church Service Society website have been downloaded and used from East Anglia to Germany as well as in Scotland. Singing these versions of the metrical psalms formed the core of an event in Greyfriars Kirk Edinburgh as part of the Sparks Arts festival in 2015.
5. The original findings of the Wode Psalter project made possible a new project entitled Singing the Reformation 2016 held in St Mary's Parish Church Haddington in March and April 2016. It included new recordings of the psalms sung in a 'congregational' setting and in the context of a partial recreation of worship c1600 in the medium of the Scots language. These recordings and the scores are freely available for download on the Church Service Society website and are being circulated within the Church of Scotland as part of their worship in Scots programme.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F0F61A25-1ED1-49F2-8646-16197298122E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-2216253012.620148de2838b0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One of Scotland's cultural treasures, the Wode Partbooks, their music and their Reformation world have been introduced and made better known to audiences within Scotland, the UK and the wider world.
