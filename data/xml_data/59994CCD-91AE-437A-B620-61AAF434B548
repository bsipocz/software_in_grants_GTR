Thousands of Arabic-speaking families, most of them from Syria and Iraq, have taken up residence in Germany and Sweden in the last two years, while hundreds of unaccompanied refugee children have found homes in these countries and the UK. Although German public broadcasters ZDF and ARD have responded to the challenge by providing adult news services in Arabic and Arabic subtitles for other items, provision for children also needs attention. Our project will show how imaginatively produced screen content for young children could fill worrying gaps in what is currently available to children on all sides of forced migration flows at a time when they may struggle to make sense of the new environment in which they find themselves.

The project objectives are to use our research findings to: 
1. Alert European screen content practitioners to the media needs, wants and experiences of young Arabic-speaking migrant children (under 12) and families. 

2. Create spaces for critical reflection and dialogue between European cultural gatekeepers who regulate, commission, fund, produce or comment on children's content and practitioners with experience of children's media in Arab countries. 

3. Help European stakeholders to think through policy, production initiatives, public discourse and professional practice as they seek to ensure that pluralistic and high quality content is available to an increasingly diverse young audience. 

4. Identify effective elements of regulation, financing, production and advocacy practice applicable to screen content aimed at young migrant children in Europe.

5. Demonstrate to key European and Arab stakeholders how children's media rights, articulated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), are fundamental to children's future participation as citizens, and prompt further research into how screen media can help migrant children develop their identities in new environments.

6. Raise awareness of the communication needs of migrant children among a wider public.

European broadcasters, producers and NGOs in Europe will benefit from dialogue which generates better understanding of young Arabic-speaking audiences, allowing them to engage more effectively with young children whose lives and education have been seriously disrupted. They will benefit through the transfer of knowledge about Arabic-speaking children's media use and expectations, leading to better understanding of children's needs. The use of Arab practitioners as experts represents an innovative step towards creating new European conceptualisations of the Arab child audience, breaking with the tradition of research travelling in one direction only. The project will create increased opportunities for future collaborations and new spaces for exchanging research. Arab participants will benefit through engagement in an international conversation about children's screen media at a range of events, from the Children's Global Media Summit in Manchester in December 2017 to more intimate workshops in France and Germany.The most significant impacts of this project will be: 
* Changed perspectives among new stakeholders, through further dissemination of our research findings 
* Better understanding of the media and communications needs of child migrants by producers, policy-makers, broadcasters and advocacy groups
* Policy recommendations for engaging young Arab migrant audiences;
* Reports on knowledge exchange to stakeholders through presentations and reports in appropriate outlets. 
* Raised visibility of Arabic-speaking children's media needs and active exchange of effective practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will raise awareness of the communications needs of migrant children from the Arabic speaking world based on research that has explored policy, texts, audiences and children's media production across a highly differentiated Arabic-speaking region. 
ARAB MEDIA PRACTITIONERS Arab practitioners consulted during our AHRC research frequently identified the one-way flow of information and media aid from the West to Arab countries even in circumstances that are supposed to involve co-production (e.g. Sesame Workshop) or NGO initiatives (Goethe Institut, Wadada News for Kids). Arab media practitioners who will attend and participate in three workshops and the end of project symposium are therefore beneficiaries themselves. They are keen to open up a dialogue with Western colleagues and share their expertise of making content for young Arab audiences - particularly in respect of developing ideas for a diverse Arab audience, where conceptualisations of childhood differ, as do media organisation responses to the challenges of children's media. Arab children's media practitioners will benefit from participation in the three workshops and end of project symposium because of the opportunity to engage in knowledge exchange. Participation in events located in Europe will provide a unique opportunity to engage in dialogue and access European networks and markets, allowing a two way learning process that could also benefit children's media produced in Arab countries. 

EUROPEAN CULTURAL PRACTITIONERS Cultural gatekeepers include European broadcasters, content producers and children's media advocacy groups who will benefit from better understanding of the basic differences between European and Arab media ecologies and approaches to childhood as they seek to integrate the needs of Arab and other migrant children into their planning and commissioning for children. We will organise three separate workshops at the Children's Global Media Summit (CGMS) in the UK, the Global Kids Media Congress (GKMC) in France and at the International Central Institute for Youth and Educational Television (IZI) in Germany for European broadcasters, producers and other stakeholders to connect with professionals who commission, fund and make children's content in Arab countries. Participation in these events will allow commissioners and programme-makers to access research about Arab child audiences and Arab media cultures that will allow them to rethink how they might reach out to Arabic-speaking children and also reflect diversity in a European context. It will alert them to the media needs, wants and experiences of Arabic-speaking children, based on children's media experience from their home countries and allow them to question and interrogate how migrant children are represented and viewed. 

EUROPEAN NGOs, POLICY MAKERS, ADVOCACY GROUPS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES Policy briefing documents from the workshops and symposium will provide further guidance on the media and communications needs of Arabic-speaking migrant children. Highlighting the gap in what is available to migrant children in the West, workshops, briefings and a Stakeholder Resource Book will support international agencies, policy-makers, NGOs and regulatory bodies in adjusting existing practices taking account of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, regulation, funding, production and advocacy practice in order to ensure pluralistic, high quality content for increasingly diverse young audiences. 

ACADEMIC BENEFICIARIES While non-academic beneficiaries are the primary audience for this research, academic beneficiaries of this project will be international researchers examining children's media, literature, film, and theatre within Arabic speaking cultures as well as academics working on responses to migration, and the politics of representation more widely.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80360</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R001421/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8CFBC166-7B26-4853-BEC7-A2087E737752</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Middle East Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
