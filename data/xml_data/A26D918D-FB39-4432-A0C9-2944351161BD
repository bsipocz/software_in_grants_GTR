Over one quarter million gardeners and farmers have used the software and apps. GI holds a wealth of location-based information on which crops, varieties and quantities gardeners are growing in their location and they are extending the recording to include dated observations of pests and diseases on crops.

This project will statistically analyse the crowd-sourced pest and disease observations recorded in their apps in conjunction with meteorological information to develop much more accurate predictive systems along with innovative visualisations to help predict pest and disease emergence on crops. Meteorological information and weather forecasts can then be used to provide significantly improved pest prediction for growers for the current growing season specific to their location. These will form the basis of new services for GI's customers, the horticultural industry and agriculture, helping growers to reduce losses due to plant pests and diseases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Economic Impact: Within the consortium, supplying data feeds from the pest prediction models opens up new markets - an estimated 33% increase in revenue to Growing Interactive, growing to 43% over 5 years and new data products. Beyond the consortium, increased efficiency (though decreased losses) in agriculture has wide ranging benefits, lowering prices and providing even greater benefit to the economy as a whole. On completion of the project, we would like to extend the system to developing countries where mobile phones deliver the internet, working with NGOs to tackle the problem of insect damage in subsistence farming.

2. Social Impact: The 2008 Cabinet Office Study 'Food Matters' highlights the health gains associated with fresh produce:
&amp;quot;Reaching the 5 A DAY target for fruit and vegetable consumption could mean that around 42,000 premature deaths are avoided each year... [the Government] will adopt a specific target of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in low-income young families.&amp;quot; [section ES36]. Growing Interactive's garden planning apps, when combined with the pest and disease prediction service, dramatically increase the success of home growing, providing access to fresh, healthy produce at minimal cost. Studies have also shown that growing food brings substantial benefits across a wide range of health and social issues.

3. Environmental Impact: The 'Food Matters' study states: &amp;quot;The food chain has huge environmental impacts. Reducing the food chain's dependence on energy, water and other resources will reduce its exposure to future increases in resource prices. Reducing the quantity of waste and GHG emissions can improve resource efficiency and anticipate the changes required for the transition to a low-carbon economy.&amp;quot;
Improved plant pest and disease prediction impacts almost all of the factors which contribute to the food system's environmental impact: increased efficiency through decreased crop spoilage, reduced exposure to resource price fluctuations, less dependence on expensive pesticides and fungicides and the negative environmental impact of such inputs. More localised pest predictions help make local food systems more productive and competitive, lowering environmental impact as transportation costs are reduced. Pest and disease prediction is particularly useful for organic
production techniques, which by nature have considerably lower environmental impact and form an important part of the transition to a low-carbon economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rothamsted Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>North Wyke Farm Platform</gtr:department><gtr:description>Rothamsted Insect Survey, Rothamsted Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>E83694A0-4989-4E04-BA3A-85A3147081EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We submitted a research manuscript to Ecological Indicators on February 8th 2017.

In addition a 'widget' version of the reporting tool was developed and placed on major gardening websites such as GrowVeg.com, Suttons.co.uk, Almanac.com and MotherEarthNews.com.
Weekly content (during the gardening season) was (and continues to be) produced including newsletters, bug identification guides, videos and other engaging content such as top reported pests and research news.
A major press-release and media awareness campaign was launched in 2017 and commitments to print have been obtained from major gardening media, including the RHS magazine, Gardeners World magazine and a national newspaper in the UK. Further afield, the Big Bug Hunt has been covered on international blogs (e.g. bugeric.blogspot.com) and a major press release campaign is currently being organised in the US.
Over 11,000 bug reports have been generated through this engagement activity and this rate is growing each year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c00b44bb8f36.82635797</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bigbughunt.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Selecting the 'best' environmental drivers is an imperative phase in generating predictive biological models; however, environmental variables are often selected with little consideration to the temporal scales at which they operate. Machine learning approaches have the potential to identify the most informative time windows to select environmental variables, whilst simultaneously improving species predictions. We used a C5.0 boosted decision tree model along with entropy to identify the most informative temporal extents and resolutions of the meteorological variables responsible for flight patterns in 51 UK aphid species. Decision tree models significantly (a&amp;lt;0.01) improved the accuracy of first flight prediction by upwards of 20% compared to general additive model implementations, and entropy selected variables significantly (a&amp;lt;0.01) improved the accuracy by a further 3-5% compared to expert derived variables.</gtr:description><gtr:id>53E5267D-7DF5-4992-822C-79B109FA2886</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research is currently under review as a manuscript at Ecological Indicators.

However, the prediction of 'presence' or 'occurrence' when using machine learning techniques requires response variables that represent 'absence' in order to categorise observations. Reliable reports of 'absence' are difficult to attain. Was the pest really absent or did the user just not observe it, or was it just not there at the time of sampling? Pseudo-absences provide a comparative data set to enable the conditions under which a species occurs to be contrasted to those where it is absent (or at least the full range of environmental conditions within the species' geographic range). The majority of methods developed to generate pseudo-absences focus on the spatial aspect of where these are generated and how they are weighted. The time-stamp associated with crowd-sourced observations, coupled with the overall aim of this project to develop 'real-time' pest predictions, means that pseudo-absences need to be generated in both spatially and temporally explicit circumstances. Our preliminary research identifies that the incorporating time into these predictions can have large implications for the predictive outputs, and this is an avenue that we are currently exploring further.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6620FE31-6DBE-4936-9BFB-0B2E85EE3F00</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c13a7c039fc5.35276833</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Pseudo-Absence Generation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data handling &amp; control</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E0BEA417-1BC2-44FC-92E1-6C3F8CF7C3BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic selection of environmental variables to improve the prediction of aphid phenology: A machine learning approach</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecological Indicators</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e788f3e23f07b6a252af6192f321cb7"><gtr:id>4e788f3e23f07b6a252af6192f321cb7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holloway P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a96bab22fb972.26661188</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M006980/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
