The primary aim of this research project is to bring a new perspective to understanding the significance of place in studies of Christian pilgrimage, with a particular focus on landscape as a lens through which pilgrims visualise and experience the spiritual, as well as being the site of the performance of pilgrimage itself. While previous studies have identified place as a central element of pilgrimage (along with people and texts), the spatial aspects of pilgrimage have been framed in terms of static shrines and their surrounding architecture, spatial networks of shrines or pilgrims, spaces of mobility and performance, and sacred space as a reflective 'void'. While the location of many pilgrimage sites in areas of outstanding natural beauty has been noted, the role of the landscape and its aesthetics in 'sacred place', religious and emotional experience in pilgrimage centres has been given little attention. We are interested in whether landscape aesthetics adds to a pilgrimage site's 'spiritual magnetism', how this is experienced and articulated by pilgrims and other visitors, and whether this blurs the distinction between pilgrims and other visitors. Another issue is whether landscape aesthetics attract large numbers to the sites, reducing the quality of experience and environment.\n\nDrawing on an interdisciplinary perspective grounded in social and cultural geography, history and theology, this research project will examine the significance of landscape in three international case studies, reflecting and comparing different denominational practices within the Christian tradition. Each case study focuses on the landscape as a site of religious experience and repository of metaphors and journeys, exploring evolving interactions between pilgrims and landscape over time and in the present day through written accounts, visual representations, participant observation, surveys and interviews. \n\nCase Studies\n1. Met&amp;eacute;ora (literally 'suspended in the air'), Greece, is one of the largest monastic complexes and pilgrimage destinations of the Orthodox church, Byzantine monasteries are built on natural sandstone rock pillars several hundred meters high and are deemed to constitute one of the most evocative landscapes in the world. Largely inaccessible prior to 1923, road access has opened the monasteries to large numbers of Orthodox pilgrims and tourists. In the Orthodox tradition, pilgrimage (or proskynese) refers to the act of bowing down to an icon, or to relics, rather than the act of journeying. At the Meteora, however, proskynese cannot be divorced from moving through and gazing at the surrounding landscape. \n2. The Benedictine monastery of Sacro Speco ('Holy Cave'), near the town of Subiaco in central Italy enshrines the cavern where at the end of the fifth century St Benedict lived as a hermit for three years. The monastery provides a sacred landscape engineered to evoke sites in the Holy Land and the life of St. Benedict through a complex topography of loci memoriae. The monastic complex attracts three different types of 'pilgrim': the Catholic faithful's re-activation of Benedict's life and Christian narratives; tourists' visual consumption of the scenic views from the monastery; and humanist scholars to the library of the nearby monastery of Santa Scolastica.\n3. The Isle of Man was a foundation site of the early Celtic church, but had little tradition of pilgrimage in the post Reformation era. The meaning and means of the recent reanimation of local pilgrimage through the 'Praying the Keeills' initiative will be explored with reference to the 1997 joint centenaries of Saints Ninian and Columbaa, Protestant and ecumenical initiatives, and the role of coastal landscapes in attracting 'pilgrims' (including non-adherents) and their experience of pilgrimage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? How will they benefit from this research?\n\nThree key communities which will benefit from this research and are potential users for research outcomes :\n\n1. Academics interested in pilgrimage and sacred place, conceptual and methodological developments building on ideas of geopiety and theoplacity through the lens of landscape as place, site of experience/performance and aesthetic spiritual experience. Notably this includes those working in theology, geography, history, anthropology, sociology. (See academic beneficiaries for fuller discussion).\n\n2. Groups in civil society including religious communities and related charities. Religious orders and wider faith communities associated with the locales of the case studies will gain insight of pilgrim and visitor motivations and experiences and how to facilitate/ democratise/ conserve access to sacred pilgrimage sites.\n\nExamples include: \nThe Meteora Orthodox monastic communities, Greece.\n'The Friends of Mount Athos' (who organize annual pilgrimages to Orthodox monasteries, talks, conferences, and publications for the general public).\nThe Sacro Speco Benedictine monastic community, Italy. \nThe Praying the Keeills Ecumenical Pilgrimage Group, Isle of Man.\nAssociations promoting ecumenical dialogue such as Monastero di Bose Ecumenical Community\nhttp://www.monasterodibose\n\n3. Those involved with pilgrim/ tourist/ site management, including faith communities, religious institutions, local government and local/national departments of tourism.\n\nThe empirical findings will shed light on pilgrim/visitor experience at each case study site, which can be used to inform pilgrimage/ site promotion and related management issues e.g. the interaction of faith-based pilgrims and those visiting primarily as cultural tourists - and where these blur; also balancing access to and income generation from sacred heritage sites and high value aesthetic landscapes and the needs of faith adherents, including local communities. The case studies may also shed light on debates about using public spaces for belief rituals, with implications for potential conflict, consensus discourses and/ or policing.\n\nWhat will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?\n\nReports on initial empirical findings will be summarised for Meteora, Sacro Speco and Manx faith communities and local government, tourism departments. Although the local faith communities are not formal partners in this research, their input will be central to findings and will de facto become informal partners, which may allow other outlets such as writing for their newsletters, providing informal consultancy etc..\nRepresentatives of the above groups will be invited to academic workshop disseminating findings.\nCommunication of findings will be disseminated to academic community through a day workshop when case study findings will be presented to an audience of experts and work may be revised in the light of this engagement; we will convene a dedicated conference session and present papers at the American Association of Geographers conference - the largest international gathering of geographers and related researchers working on landscape. Individual papers will also be presented at specialist and interdisciplinary conferences.\nPublications: a collaboratively written monograph on landscape and pilgrimage will be based on integrated findings; Individual and co-authored papers will be published in leading peer-reviewed journals such as J. of Historical Geography; Emotion, Society &amp;amp; Space; Landscape Research; Cultural Geographies; Mobilities; J. of Contemporary Religion, Modern Theology, J. of History of Religion. \n\nThe podcast will be available internationally via the internet; Scafi has previous experience of radio presentations and podcasts (see cv).\nAll resea</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53353</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Podcast: Landscape and Pilgrimage in the Christian Tradition</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2A77247D-3506-404F-876B-8764E2AEE9C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project podcast by Alessandro Scafi, to be found at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUahZ9V2f5s

This workshop was attended by c35 delegates, it was oversubscribed, but numbers were numbers capped in order to preserve quality of experience of workshop. Participants were stimulated by illustrated talks by poets, theologians, writers and researchers (including Avril Maddrell); small pilgrimage around the churchyard was used as a form of walking-reflection, used as inspiration for writing on sacred landscape and contemporary pilgrimage. Participants expressed new understandings of the rich meanings of pilgrimage and new approaches to creative writing, especially through the process of reflective walking-thinking-writing.

Over 70 children walked the labyrinth mat, also giving opportunities to talk to accompanying parents; c 50 sets of games and wordsearches were taken and 30 'favourite keeills' identified; c 100 adults engaged with the stall, talked about the proposed pilgrimage routes etc., including IoM government representatives, clergy, walkers, Third Sector groups, tourist service providers and other interested parties. Examples of engagement include: two teachers asked to use pilgrimage activity sheets in school; a charity discussed using the pilgrimage trail for a fund-raising sponsored walk; a family planning to walk the whole coastal path in stages indicated they would use the Raad ny Foillan Pilgrimage Trail interpretation materials to organize and provide a focus for their walks.
Partners also ran the publicity stall at the Royal Manx Agricultural show (August 2016), with similar results.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca70a4b44d05.91011796</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Follow on funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>CB1776B7-80AF-4EED-AC11-A366151E4A8E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddad46ef3f33.76075287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Isle of Man case study was a catalyst to Faith based Tourism workshop held in Isle of Man April 2014.

Landscape was shown to be a significant factor in pilgrim experience across the three international case studies; although in each case there were also a small number of pilgrims who were entirely focused on their spiritual quest and oblivious to their surroundings. 
2. Numerous non-pilgrims were inspired by the interface of spiritual practice/ sense of 'sacred place' and landscape to undertake personal reflection, or recounted a spiritual/sublime experience. 
3. Pilgrimage sites and routes attract those without religious affiliation/ beliefs but who are interested in cultural heritage, thematic trails and challenging walks.
4. Pilgrims do not have to be long distance travelers; residents can undertake pilgrimage in their own locality.
5. Pilgrimage sites and routes can attract visitors and create employment through support services e,g, hotels, hostels, cafes, souvenirs etc..
6. In the Isle of Man, the case study where pilgrimage was least developed/ formalized, there was an appetite for a permanent pilgrimage route/s; there was little accessible information in the public domain on numerous sites of the early medieval chapels.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See AHRC follow on project - virtual pilgrimage trails in the Isle of Man (2015-16)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D47C1200-7454-4CBC-AE82-BD44A713A76B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9ee834c039.21672662</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4D227F7B-8BFA-43CD-8FF2-6C6D8A93E109</gtr:id><gtr:title>Setting and Blurring Boundaries: Pilgrims, Tourists, and Landscape in Mount Athos and Meteora</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annals of Tourism Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9788a446cf1f3564a2e390769e3ecdae"><gtr:id>9788a446cf1f3564a2e390769e3ecdae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>della Dora V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe3fe3309a970</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>59E303F4-CD26-4756-8F82-BF62F99B779C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Visual Constructs of Jerusalem</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/77f6f4c41c04071c8937c72bd87d1710"><gtr:id>77f6f4c41c04071c8937c72bd87d1710</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scafi, A.,</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>54623305c4a051.47690207</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>526EB9B4-E74C-40A0-A7BA-305673E728FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Crossing Surfaces in Search of the Holy: Landscape and Liminality in Contemporary Christian Pilgrimage</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment and Planning A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/62ce2ce75bbe950436a6d39a150b4fcd"><gtr:id>62ce2ce75bbe950436a6d39a150b4fcd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maddrell A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd8502ebbf12.32421994</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>523D05A1-B467-4F8F-AD76-878E84F80E73</gtr:id><gtr:title>Christian pilgrimage, landscape and heritage.
