Objects are defined as chiral if they exist as a pair of &amp;quot;left handed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;right handed&amp;quot; mirror images that cannot be superimposed. Importantly, these two forms cannot generally be differentiated by their physical properties: the chiral handedness only becomes evident when one chiral object interacts with another chiral object. Like using your right hand to shake either the right hand (homochiral), or left hand (heterochiral) of another person will lead to different results, the interaction of a chiral molecule with another chiral molecule (or object) of the same or opposite handedness can differ. 

Small molecule chirality has long provided an intellectually challenging endeavour for selective chemical synthesis and catalysis. Arguably, the inspiration behind the majority of studies in (organic) asymmetric synthesis has been biologically-relevant molecules; be it complex chiral natural products or pharmaceutically active compounds. Nature has evolved with a single handedness (homochirality) and in research, biologically relevant small molecules often require chiral structures to interact selectively with a chiral biological receptor. Since such interactions ultimately control downstream function, the importance of chirality in a biological context is abundantly clear.

Conversely, other areas of science and technology have generally not considered chirality to be important for function. In the area of organic electronic devices, a small range of non-chiral conjugated organic small molecules and polymeric materials are most frequently employed. While the technological development in this area has clearly been a successful enterprise, there is pressing need for further innovation. I believe that the unique properties of chiral materials will result in chirality becoming a central design criterion for organic conjugated small molecules and lead to new paradigms in material design, device fabrication and functional applications. I propose to exploit chiral molecular architectures where the conjugated system is an integral part of the chirality, and use such molecules in a range of materials and device contexts that will exploit chirality to control nanoscale assembly and function.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As outlined in the 'Academic Beneficiaries' section, the science proposed herein would have significant impact on current academic and industrial knowledge in a large range of disciplines including chemistry, physics and materials science. It will therefore impact the knowledge economy in such diverse areas. For example, it may lead to new principles in organic materials selection: one could select the appropriate transport properties for a given application purely by altering the chiral purity of a single chemical semiconducting component; the conductivity simply controlled by the chiral composition selected. This would be a paradigm shift in the way OSC materials and devices are traditionally approached. Furthermore, through in-film racemisation, this approach may allow for simple nanolithography of patterned thin films with different charge transfer domains for nanoelectronics. 

Any translational aspect of this proposal, for example fabricating CP-OLEDs and CP photo-OFETs, would be of high interest to a number of key industrial companies (Cambridge Display Technologies, Plastic Logic, Merck, BASF, etc) involved in plastic electronics research. Technological advances resulting from this work would have clear ramifications in terms of wealth creation within the UK; the current OLED market is valued at &amp;gt;$2.5B. As an example application, current AMOLED displays employ a circular polarising filter to improve contrast by reducing external reflected light. Using a circular polariser ensures almost all reflected light is blocked; however, at the same time nearly 50% of the transmitted light from the OLED emission is cut out by the filter, dramatically reducing overall display efficiency. If one was to directly generate circularly polarised light in a comparable display architecture, far more light would be transmitted, resulting in lower losses in brightness at the circular polarising filter, improving both efficiency and lifetime. The more polarised the light from the OLED, the more light would pass through the filter. Such displays with a lowered carbon footprint would be of clear environmental impact, and therefore of benefit to society as a whole. In more general terms, CP light emitting and detecting devices would have a strong impact in current and future technologies such as tomography and integrated optical quantum computing. Finally, further training of skilled co-workers and the educational experiences of students involved in this science would also have clear economic and societal impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2023-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1584212</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R00188X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
