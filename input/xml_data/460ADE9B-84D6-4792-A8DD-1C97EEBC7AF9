However, despite this few studies have examined the longer-term effects of newborn brain injury (?birth asphyxia?) on surviving children and their families. The ABAaNA study examines the effects of newborn brain injury on a child?s health, growth and development in early childhood. 


Early study findings have shown that around a quarter of newborn survivors are affected by cerebral palsy and related disabilities. One quarter of the children with cerebral palsy at one year of age have malnutrition due to feeding difficulties associated with their disability. A sub-study examining the mothers? of experience of caring for an infant with disability reported important financial and emotional impacts on family life. The ABAaNA study findings highlight the need for early intervention programmes to improve health, well-being and quality of life for affected children and their families.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>No large cohort studies have described outcomes from neonatal encephalopathy (NE) in sub-Saharan Africa. The ABAaNA study represents the largest cohort of NE survivors followed in sub-Saharan Africa. The study aimed to determine early outcomes after NE in urban Uganda. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using Griffiths Mental Development Scales and structured neurological examination amongst infants recruited to an unmatched case control study examining risk factors for NE in a facility based setting in Kampala. Standard classifications of severity of neurodevelopmental impairment according to developmental quotient (DQ) were used. Poor early outcome was defined as death or moderate/severe impairment, and malnutrition as a weight-for-length z-score of &amp;lt;-2. Data collection and analysis for assessment at 12-15 months is complete and at two years is ongoing. 
Results: At 12 to 15 months, 126 NE survivors and 330 control infants were assessed. Neonatal case fatality in NE was high (33.7% (70/208)) but carried no excess risk of post-neonatal mortality (3.2% cases vs 2.1% controls, p=0.50). 
Amongst NE survivors, the majority of impairment was severe (18.3% severe, 3.2% moderate and 7.1% mild). Spastic quadriplegia was the commonest pattern of physical disability seen (31.9% (9/23)). A small but significant difference between mean DQ was seen in overtly unimpaired case and control infants (104.2 vs 106.8, p=0.0044). Overall, 50.5% of cases vs. 2.7% controls had poor early outcome. Severe impairment was strongly associated with malnutrition (24.0% among impaired cases vs 5.3% in unimpaired, P=0.004) and smaller head circumference (56.5% vs. 3.3%, respectively with z-score&amp;lt;2, p&amp;lt;0.001). 
Conclusion: In this Ugandan cohort, mortality and impairment in survivors was high, and was associated with malnutrition and microcephaly. Early intervention programmes with a focus on feeding and nutrition are warranted.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30789</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UP_1204/9</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>712BA5B2-EB41-48F7-A933-F9EFA1D3314B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>7.1  Individual care needs</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
