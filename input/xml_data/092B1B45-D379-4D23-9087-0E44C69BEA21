We start with household needs and look outward to design infrastructure, not the other way around. This new paradigm allows integrated thinking about water, energy, food and data at the domestic scale, and connects homes to technologies, infrastructures and communities in order to meet everyday needs and demands as efficiently and reliably as possible. The project puts people and their everyday needs and desires first, using technology and infrastructure to best meet those needs within resource and environmental constraints. It addresses the challenge of designing sustainable and resilient systems and technologies to deliver infrastructure services within environmental and social constraints.

The project will develop and test a methodology for co-design of infrastructure and technologies starting from household scale and connecting to neighbourhood, city and regional scale, working with a case study community of social housing residents in London. This will involve:
1. Synthesis of existing data relating to the nexus in case study community (census, water and energy companies, Environment Agency, local authorities, public health).
2. Social research to identify needs, aspirations and daily practices that relate to food, energy and water production and consumption (interviews, diaries, focus groups, participatory mapping, sensors and monitors of resources use).
3. Developing a design support toolkit of potential technical options for meeting household needs and their lifecycle resource and environmental impacts. The toolkit will include technologies and systems that are currently in the market or are emerging and will allow for speculation about new technologies, systems and configurations.
4. Co-design workshops with the project team, SMEs, technical experts and local communities to identify options for meeting needs using alternative technologies and infrastructures.
5. Feedback to infrastructure providers, policy makers, designers and local government regarding options for new infrastructure and needs for new governance and other arrangements. 

Infrastructure development and resource efficiency are of high national importance and are vital to the future success of the British economy. This project will develop new methods for infrastructure design within resource constraints and social expectations. The project is novel in addressing connections between water, food, energy, waste and data within the home as the starting point for how to design technology and infrastructure that meets these needs while achieving resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. This project will provide new opportunities for innovation across infrastructure sectors and in domestic and neighbourhood level systems. Integrating infrastructure services across different scales of provision is a particular challenge for policy and engineering, which will be addressed through the methods devised in this project. A new design paradigm starting from domestic needs and expectations will also help deliver infrastructure that is socially acceptable and desirable to local communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact of this project will come through direct engagement with stakeholders, SMEs and communities through participation in the research and co-design. Direct engagement in the research process will provide stakeholders with understanding of the method and approach and the opportunity shape the outcomes. A stakeholder workshop will be before and after the co-design workshops with local authorities, water and energy companies, regulators, NGOs and other relevant actors to review the co-design method, report the outcomes of the workshops and to explore implications for regulation, industry and further development. The project will be represented through a page on the Engineering Exchange website and promoted through relevant local and institutional public engagement mechanisms such as festivals, science comedy, podcasts, blogs and social media. The researchers will be supported by UCL to pursued part-time secondments into relevant government departments and agencies, such as Infrastructure UK or DEFRA, to translate the findings of the project into policy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296437</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has had a direct positive impact on the residents of Meakin Estate and their landlords the Leathermarket Joint Management Board. The project has engaged 19 Meakin residents and 4 members of staff of the Leathermarket JMB. Residents have increased knowledge of infrastructure systems and alternatives for provision, and will benefit from a custom designed rainwater harvesting system. This has supported community development on the estate in partnership with the Decima Street Tenants and Residents Association. The co-design process is being replicated as a UCL student project with residents of Peverill House, focussing on garden and play area in a partially vacant roof space. Leathermarket JMB have invited the project team and residents to apply for up to &amp;pound;10,000 to implement project outcomes.

The stakeholder advisory group for the project has built strong interest in the work from designers, environmental organisations and infrastructure providers, including Thames Water, Groundwork, Waterwise, KLH Sustainability, Foster and Partners. Members of the group will join as formal partners providing further resources and case studies.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7CD17EC8-105A-470B-92F7-B0A6B95FD4E7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e7dbdeed71.39850197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project deliverables are:
1) Toolkit for co-design of technology and infrastructure to meet household needs, including:
 
? Social practice characterisation methods (diaries, interview templates, appliance logs)
? Co-design methodology 
? 2-4-8 value elicitation
? Co-Design Tokens and equipment for building and discussing systems ideas
? Video documentation and sound recording
? Field observation template
? Formalised method for analysing workshop outcomes 
? Options appraisal method
? LCA Calculator
? Fact sheets and photos for selected technology options
 

2) Evaluation of co-design methods, including ethnographic research requirements. Key outcomes include:
 
? Moving from user-centred design to co-design
? Detailed awareness of institutional constraints in community-based co-design 
? Short dissemination video of the first co-design workshop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7P2gxwwUG4 
 

3) Designs for systems and technologies for infrastructure services in a London community. The horizon scan identified a suite of possible technologies for community based provision of water-energy-food infrastructure. Factsheets were produced for shortlisted technologies, focussing on rainwater harvesting and waste reduction. A second site was identified for co-designing a community space for play and food production.

4) Development of quick-win information based technologies identified in the co-design workshops, to facilitate community understanding of water use for landscaping and rainwater harvesting.

5) Detailed requirements for a rainwater harvesting system to meet needs identified through the ethnography and co-design workshops.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further development and testing of the LCA calculator - a lifecycle assessment application for use by non-experts.
