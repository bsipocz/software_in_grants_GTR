From a health services delivery point of view, the management of chronic HIV infection and the management of other chronic disease have many features in common. 
In this research project we aim to contribute to the health systems? response to chronic diseases, by providing data on the burden of treatable chronic diseases including HIV infection in 2 selected study populations in Uganda and Tanzania, and then then to design and evaluate a health system intervention to improve the management of chronic diseases in primary health care services. 
The first phase of this study will consist of:
(i) a baseline review of policy and practices in regard to the long term HIV care and care of treatable chronic disease.
(ii) a population survey to be conducted in 2 communities in Uganda and Tanzania in order to document the burden of treatable chronic diseases and chronic HIV infection
(iii) a health facility survey from the same communities to assess the capacity of sampled health facilities to manage these conditions.
These surveys will be supplemented by social sciences and health economic studies and conducted in close collaboration with the national health services, with the overall aim being to find and institute simple service interventions that will improve the management of chronic diseases in primary health care centres such as dispensaries, peripheral health centres and outpatient departments of district hospitals.

In the 2nd phase of the study we will use the findings from the 1st phase to design and implement a simple and affordable package of health service interventions aimed at improving the management of chronic diseases in primary health care centres such as dispensaries, peripheral health centres and outpatient departments of district hospitals. Through a follow on study, the impact of this health service intervention on access to care for chronic diseases and the quality of care delivery will be evaluated.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Traditionally, acute infectious diseases have been the main challenges for primary health systems in many sub-Saharan African countries. In the recent years however, primary care services in Africa have been facing an increasing burden of chronic diseases (CDs). Two factors that probably contribute to this trend are an increasing burden of chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma as well as an increasing number of individuals on lifelong treatment for HIV infection.
Health services in sub Saharan Africa are in general ill equipped to manage these chronic conditions. Health workers at primary care facilities are often overburdened and usually lack the necessary tools, training and experience in chronic disease management and simple standardised treatment guidelines and protocols are not universally available. 
At the same time there are few available systematic data to quantify the burden of CDs at population level since appropriate systems for documentation and reporting on CDs at health facility level as well as in the community are insufficiently developed. Existing data collection systems are not standardised and the data collected are often inadequate, making it difficult to plan appropriate responses and to evaluate their quality and effects. The result is a vicious circle in which the lack of necessary data, the lack of evidence-based policies and an inadequate response at primary care level reinforce each other, thus perpetuating a problem that will become worse over time unless it is actively addressed. Research is needed on the burden and risk factors for CDs to generate data that will guide policies on improved clinical care of patients with these diseases, direct preventive measures and make more effective use of resources. 
This research project aims to contribute to the health systems? response to chronic diseases, by providing data on the burden of treatable chronic diseases including HIV infection in 2 selected study populations and then designing and evaluating a health system intervention to improve the management of chronic diseases in primary health care services. 
The study will be conducted in 2 selected populations in Uganda and Tanzania and is being planned and implemented in close collaboration with the Ministries of Health in the two countries.
Two districts in Uganda: Mpigi and Wakiso districts, and 3 districts in Tanzania: Geita, Kahama districts and Mwanza City have been selected for the study. The population survey is a stratified multi-stage sampling survey and will recruit 800 participants each from Uganda and Tanzania. The Health facility survey will include 24 health facilities representing different levels of the health services.
The 1st phase of the study will comprise: Collection of data required for health planning through: (i) a population survey to document burden of disease, (ii) a health facility survey to document current practices in the management of CDs, (iii) costing studies to estimate costs of providing or receiving care for chronic diseases, and (iv) social science studies to document community perceptions as well as health staff perceptions and attitudes. 
The 2nd phase of the study will consist of design and phased implementation of an affordable intervention to improve the management of chronic diseases in primary health care centres such as dispensaries, peripheral health centres and outpatient departments of district hospitals; evaluation of the intervention and dissemination activities aiming to translate the findings and results into policy and programming.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>918916</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Medical Research, Tanzania</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Tanzania, United Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit</gtr:description><gtr:id>D22B611D-B3B2-4838-A7EB-B92C311737E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet, project ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>mCDnnNRcucA-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint design and implementation of study project</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Joint design and implementation of study project</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine</gtr:description><gtr:id>E1A11198-0ECD-494D-916D-1C445504E0BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>pusVoAN99b2-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Grant holders, joint design and implementation of research project</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Grant writing and Joint design and implementation of research project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ministry of Health, Uganda</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Uganda, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Uganda Ministry of Health NCD Department</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E69708C-1925-462D-BBA3-A95B1C8E1D23</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training curriculum for health workers on management of NCDs in primary care cetera in Uganda</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546dc8574f3863.04212866-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provision of National guidelines on management of NCDs.
