As well as conducting recorded audio interviews with a number of individuals from a range of DCMS sector organisations already involved in carbon reduction and sustainability programmes, the research draws on the existing literature from government reports, academic research and reports from non-departmental public bodies. Examples of successful carbon reduction strategies in DCMS sectors are identified, as well as some of the barriers to their implementation. This research also considers the role that DCMS sectors - with their wide public reach - have in generating public debate and discourse around climate change and related environmental issues.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The interviews will form a publicly available archive hosted by the Open University; the conclusions from the research will be presented to the Science and Research Advisory Committee of DCMS and disseminated to relevant DCMS sector organisations.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48208</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Energy and Climate Change</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>DECC partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>2A0CAD6F-E99D-45F4-AE75-9739D34CEC9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of contacts made during the placement, I was able to secure the partcipation of senior policy officers from DECC and City Hall in the Stories of Change - Energy Generation project, which I led.

As a Fellow within the Dept for Culture Media and Sport I participated in Future Strategy and Evidence and Analysis meetings to highlight the importance of sustainability for the Department. I also engaged actively with Non-departmental Governing Bodies, and with institutions across the cultural, media and sports sectors to gather information on sustainability measures and strategies for DCMS. An important part of this gathering process was also to demonstrate the engagement of DCMS with the issue. Finally, I was also able to connect both of these communities with the academic community - both by feeding back some of the results of my research, but as importantly by drawing together organisations and individuals that would not else have met. 

My report to DCMS, with interviews, extensive bibliography and overviews of a number of sectors and individual case studies, and recommendations was circulated within DCMS.

Through contacts established during this placement, I continue to work with representatives in Whitehall, especially in DECC, and also in City Hall on the issue of climate change. In particular, as part of my current role on the AHRC Stories of Change project, I am drawing on these contacts to continue to bridge the gap between academia and the policy world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AA624D91-6E20-4573-BBA7-74A8A2F76BF0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464b13dd652d9.03411879</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One of the key findings of my research for DCMS was that there were many strategies and actions already implemented for tackling sustainability and carbon emissions with DCMS sectors. My research documented many of these. However, I also highlighted that while DCMS had shown an engagement with the topic of climate change in the past, its efforts on this topic had reduced drastically and that this was apparent to organisations within its sectors. 

I advised that DCMS needed to take a more active role in overseeing, and preferably evaluating, the measures being taken by organisations across its sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am continuing to work with organisations across the policy, academic and cultural sectors, drawing on my findings and experiences from this fellowship to further develop the way that cultural organisations in particular can help sustain the debates around sustainability and climate change. 

While DCMS engagement with the topic of climate change has regressed since the time of my award, many of the organisations in its sectors continue to make progress in this area, and I continue to build partnerships with these organisations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>924B4C6B-0822-4160-A900-A8F459F7A2F9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464b4409fdb63.07095479</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Energy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>418A2539-0FE5-446E-B0C4-63F3BC17DF62</gtr:id><gtr:title>DCMS and climate change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e876bd75b667f6a58cd199bfdf2e2633"><gtr:id>e876bd75b667f6a58cd199bfdf2e2633</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith BTL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5463d8d42f2169.22585328</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-173-27-0258</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J002569/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
