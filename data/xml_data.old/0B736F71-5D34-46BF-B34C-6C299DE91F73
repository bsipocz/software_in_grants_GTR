This popularity means that managing organisations must ensure that development is sensitive to ecological, social and economic interests whilst also fulfilling their duty for providing quiet enjoyment of the countryside.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Defining tranquillity is key to addressing these objectives, yet is complex not least due to its subjective qualities.&amp;nbsp; Statutes emphasise breadth of stakeholder engagement in planning decisions and with best practice, community engagement is considered critical.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yet, challenges for practice and research remain evident, particularly in capturing and then utilising the breadth of local views on the subject.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of this research is to develop and test an approach to tranquillity modelling that encompasses the breadth of stakeholder views inclusive of institutions, visitors and of the so-called hard-to-reach members of the local community. A mixed methods approach is initiated through a series of participatory action frameworks, from which views on the objective and subjective nature of tranquillity will be captured. These views determine the final outputs of this research: a high resolution GIS planning tool that can be practically implemented in protected area management and that is transferable to alternative locations. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The key overall impacts of this research concern the unique breadth of community engagement, addressing international and national protected area governance statutes and best practice policies. These impacts are enhanced by the focus that is taken of practical implementation. Other key impact is the use of research findings in the planning and management of a designated and protected area, notably so given the increasing attention (e.g. in the Rio Earth Summit 2012) on enhancing sustainable green economies. Impact will also be in addressing the tension between the the contribution that increased rural tourism can make to local economies while at the same time addressing conservation responsibilities. The project will therefore have a methodological impact that will extend beyond the British Isles. The practical outcome of the project is a GIS model showing community and users' views on tranquillity, which in turn can inform the location of tourism and recreational developments and conservation enhancements. Further, a key objective of the research is the incorporatation of the model in the forthcoming Dorset AONB management plan (2014-2018). The management plan is a statutory document that influences planning policy and programmes across county, district and numerous parish councils as well as informing Village Design Statements. The research will therefore impact policy at a number of levels within the local government hierarchy. Equally under planning policy, sound evidence is required to support the creation of development planning documents. With the extensive and intensive two-way consultation that will take place, and equal attention paid to those classed as the hard-to reach, the results of the research will constitute 'sound evidence' that is required in the creation of community driven policies in the case study area selected. The project will thus have an impact that transforms public views to policy. Lastly, the project will have an impact beyond the local level. A technical paper on its methodology will be written for Natural England, while this, the journal publication and the project website will make the project findings available to international organisations that manage rural areas. In this last respect it is noteworthy that US, Canadian and Spanish natural park authorities have expressed interest in the project team's approach to modelling tranquillity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97516</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The British Academy</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Where We Live Now - making sense of place</gtr:description><gtr:id>0BDB2805-4715-4CFF-BFD1-222200D89D49</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication and Policy Briefing on place based policy making in the UK.

This popularity has been due to BETP's extensive use in the identification of tranquil/non tranquil spaces according to local residents, visitors and institutions views on rural, semi-rural and urban locations in Purbecks, Dorset. Consequently this work has encouraged substantial engagement with managing agencies, Local Planning Authorities and with national governing bodies. 
At the local level BETP's framework and its findings have provided the team of the Dorset AONB with a unique benchmark of tranquillity specific to the Purbecks, Dorset. This result marks a key milestone in the management, evaluation and monitoring of Tranquillity, as a statutorily designated Special Quality of the AONB, for which the potential to conduct a longitudinal study is being considered. Subsequently, BETP's framework and its findings are being used to inform decisions taken on the implementation of the AONB's current management plan, will consequently inform the formulation of the subsequent management plan 2019-2023 and ultimately, will be used to inform the AONB's responses to consultations from local planning authorities on strategic planning issues. Consequently, to date the BETP has informed decisions taken on the implementation of policies concerning Minerals and Waste Strategies, the Local Plan especially in relation to housing and infrastructure developments and the progression of UK and EU strategic frameworks concerning conservation and development objectives inclusive of those concerned with 'Dark Skies'. 
Whilst conservation is a key priority for local managing agencies, the area also serves as a major tourism destination. As such, managing agencies have to balance the direction of both tourism developments with conservation priorities. This dual management role is being informed by the consolidation of the BETP GIS models into an interactive tranquillity map of the area subsequently, decisions taken on tourism development and visitor management strategies will be enhanced. Additionally, the 'Tranquillity Explorer' that will result will be available for public access. Use of this service is envisaged by tourism operators in promoting local tranquil spaces and by visitors as a guide to accessing many of the tranquil areas identified in the Purbecks. Through engagement with local charities and the Jurassic World Heritage Education team, the Tranquillity Explorer is also expected to result as an educational resource for use in schools, colleges and universities particularly in relation to studies concerning heritage management, geography and the development of rural and coastal tourism economies. 
Additional practitioner interest is demonstrated in a number of BET projects being created in alternative locations. One such example is planned for 2017 in South of England. A programme of projects, funded through Heritage Lottery Funding, is supporting the design of a tranquillity project that is wholly founded on the BETP yet extends community consultation further by targeting specifically the views of the young and the elderly. This project emphasises the inclusionary nature of BETP's principles for public consultation through a variety of processes that include not only the spoken word but also the articulation of community views through the use of art media. 
National interest in the BETP is increasing through numerous meetings held with planning officer networks and with representatives from a number of governing bodies including, DEFRA, Natural England, NAAONB, DCLG, National Parks UK and National Trust. Discussions currently concern the use of the BETP framework in the formulation and implementation of local and particularly national planning policies and EU directives: all of which concern the identification of spaces that are prized by local communities for key aspects including their recreational, tranquil and/or wildlife values. 

This focus on the public as beneficiaries of tranquil spaces and experiences is being very recently extended through increasing government, NHS and public attention on political and economic agendas concerning quality of life and health and wellbeing. Activities are culminating in the creation of a working party that is comprised the BET Principal Investigator, protected area managers, public health officers and planning policy officers. The key objective of discussions concerns the transference of the BETP method to other areas and especially those regarded as natural green spaces.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F56947E5-B501-406F-89F4-DE008326D3D8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d589c45e5ce7.61303342</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Tranquillity is generally considered a highly subjective and ambiguous concept but nevertheless there is a need to establish a practical definition. This imperative is due to the fact that in many protected areas and indeed in the wider planning contexts there are statutory requirements for the creation, enhancement and protection of tranquil zones. It is also the case that extensive local community engagement in helping to define tranquillity is further legislated and emphasised in best practice. We created the BETP to address these challenges and ultimately produced GIS models of tranquillity of the Purbecks, Dorset. 

An extensive range of stakeholder views were collated from representatives of local authorities, managing agencies and of visitors: three stakeholder groups that had informed previous studies. Unlike previous studies local residents and specifically, those classed as the 'hard-to-reach' members of the local community were also involved. The range of participants were categorised in one of four groups involved in the study through four methods of engagement: two series of participatory action consultation(PAC) events, one comprising representatives of governing agencies, one of residents, a householder survey and a series of visitor onsite surveys. By creating these groups, we introduced an additional dimension to tranquillity studies, namely the refinement of local definitions of tranquillity according to each of the views conveyed by these groups. Subsequently, new insights into the subject have been created, by identifying distinctions on views amongst participants, including for example, differences identified according to gender. These findings raise further research questions and in practical terms have implications for how tranquillity is defined, modelled and managed in any given area.

All views, across each of the four participant groups, were counted and informed interpretations of each of the four GIS models constructed. However, limitations in the ability to construct models from qualitative participant feedback meant that only 65% of the views that were originally obtained were used in the construction of the models. With 817 participants conveying more than 9,600 views the study is the largest and most comprehensive consultation of its type in Dorset to-date. 
GIS models were produced at a resolution of 5 metres, i.e. each pixel in the model represents an area of 5 x 5 metres, a considerably higher resolution than previous models created at 250mx250m and subsequently of 500mx500m. These models show that in the cases of householders and of visitors, perceptions on non-tranquillity are greater than that reported by representatives of institutions and of governing agencies. 
Overall, participants tended to convey more views on tranquillity than non-tranquillity and the extent and intensity of non-tranquillity appears to have increased in comparison with previous GIS models created in 2006. A broad similarity of views was apparent amongst all groups involved in the study with features of the natural environment being primarily associated with tranquillity and 'sheer numbers of people' and anything of 'manmade origin', especially related to 'traffic' along the key arterial routes, with non-tranquillity. These negative factors were particularly true of householders and visitors. It was notable that frequent reference was made amongst the four participant groups to 'coastal environments' as particularly non-tranquil. For the residents, the 'coast' was the only environment identified with non-tranquillity. 


Fifty-five percent of the respondents to the householder survey were those ordinarily classed in public consultations as the elusive and 'hard-to reach' members of a community. This result needs further investigation but could be related to the survey method and/or topic presented to them, while it may also be the case that there was a perception of objectivity with a university led consultation not enjoyed by planning authorities. 

There were notable distinctions amongst householders between the views of those considered to be active citizens and those classed as the 'hard-to-reach'. The latter tend to report more tranquillity in the area than those engaged actively in decision taking forums. This finding also needs further investigation but could suggest that for those classed as 'hard to reach' the reason for their lack of engagement in decision taking activities, may simply be related to their perception that there is little need for them to be more actively engaged perhaps due to a higher level of tolerance of factors considered by others, to be not tranquil. 

The holiday season, and 'feelings of being overcrowded' were cited as contributing to non-tranquillity: a finding perhaps unsurprising given this area is a key tourist destination. 

Meeting the Grant objectives: the project aimed to test an approach to tranquillity modelling that could capture then use the breadth and depth of views collated in order to assist our Project Partners in the planning and management of their protected area. A key principle underlying the partnership was that the project could easily be replicated by practitioners in other locations. BETP had six main objectives as set out below with a commentary on each.

1. To investigate the context of tranquillity: four key sources contributing to context were examined. Firstly, academic journals, previous studies on tranquillity and the factors it is considered to comprise informed the theoretical context and the mixed method research framework created. Secondly, literature in the planning discipline and practice of planning. These included internationally recognised best practice in protected area management, local and national planning policies especially in relation to planning reforms in the UK since 2000, with their emphases on community engagement and as identified in the National Planning Policy (2012) and through the EU Environmental Noise Directive (2002), their references to tranquillity. The third source were the working documents and relevant public consultations provided by our partners. The fourth and final source derived from the views of the full range of stakeholders involved in the project. This latter information provided further currency to factors considered to represent tranquillity, informed the creation of the GIS models, and wholly supported the interpretations made of these models.


2. To identify which factors detract/complement tranquillity in the eyes of the public and institutions and by how much; More than 800 participants, representative of local and national institutions, managing agencies, local community groups, local residents and of visitors were involved in conveying more than 9,500 views on tranquillity/non tranquillity. Following analyses of these views, 19 overarching themes were identified to which each view was allocated to one or more theme. The degree to which these factors affected tranquillity was decided according to participants ranking their views and/or by counting the most popular views conveyed on tranquillity and non-tranquillity. 


3. To agree by means of consensus a locally defined perspective of tranquillity; this research objective was progressed during the series of PAC events organised at which representatives of each stakeholder group was invited. The principle of consensus was explained and agreed amongst all attendees early on in activities and resulted in each group's agreement on what they considered did or not represent their notions of tranquillity . 

Two series of road shows were organised during and at the end of the project to present the total listing of views and the final GIS models. These events were designed specifically to verify the models created with participants, thus creating additional opportunities for them to convey further views and/or agree/disagree with final interpretations made. 

4. To quantify views on tranquillity thereby providing measurable factors that can be modelled via map algebra in a geographic information system.
Topographic and other geographical/economic data were obtained from the project partners, Edina Digimap and from government agencies. These data were manipulated within the ArcGIS 10.1 package to produce 70 models representing survey participants' views of factors contributing to tranquillity (both those that contribute and those that detract from tranquillity). For each survey type (i.e. PAC, questionnaire or interview) normalised versions of the models were combined in proportion to votes cast (during consultations) or frequency of responses (collated from questionnaires and interviews) to produce overall tranquillity models.


5. To evaluate by means of extensive consultation with institutions and the public the success of the project in terms of the breadth of engagement secured and the implications of the findings in supporting the design of protected area programmes and planning policies.
On completion of data analyses and production of GIS models, the results were presented to local and national institutions and to the public at our partner's Annual Forum. This event was attended by more than 100 representatives of local bodies, managing agencies, community groups and local residents. The models were also presented during a series of roadshows at all key tourist destinations and at a number of public venues in the case study area. These presentations had two objectives: firstly in presenting what was done and how and secondly, inviting further comments on the methods used, interpretations made, models and maps of tranquillity created.

To-date the project has been presented at twelve academic conferences in the UK and overseas, inviting ongoing peer review of the research. 

This consultation process is ongoing. The study is being presented to government departments, to protected area agencies of national and international authority and to local councils. This is resulting in the research framework being currently considered for adoption in other areas. We are producing papers for dissemination in internationally peer-refereed journals, through collaboration with the British Academy, as a coauthor on a publication related to place-based policy making, additionally working with national governing agencies in the design of technical reports thus, attracting further scrutiny.


The true measure of the practical use of this study in relation to its impact or influence on the creation of or contribution to the development of planning policies as well as serving to implement objectives of protected area programmes will take time. As such, over the next twelve months, a tracking process will proceed to determine where and how the findings and/or research framework are being used. The results of this 12 month enquiry will be reported in the Narrative Report.

6. To make the approach/methodology available to those managing other rural areas via publication (journal, technical report and website).
The research framework and methodology is being made available to academics, practitioners and members of the public via conferences, webpages, publications and as policy briefing reports. In addition, following meetings with a number of national governing agencies we are currently collaborating with them to adapt the BETP methodology for use in other geographic areas.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research outcomes have been and will be taken forward through both academic and non-academic routes.


As previously noted, the findings and the methods used have already been presented at twelve conferences and practitioner annual forums in both the UK and overseas. These activities have resulted in the PI engaging in three international networks of academics and practitioners focused on citizen engagement, landscape management and enhancing governance of rural and/or protected areas. Following the adoption of the BET by a Fulbright Commission Researcher in the north of England and in the United States, collaboration is resulting in the development of a 4th international network , the aims of which are to progress research into the practice of public participation in GIS modelling and to develop a template of a Tranquillity GIS model that can be used quickly and effectively in any urban and/or rural location. We are continuing to progress the project with academic journals. 

Attending practitioner forums has created opportunities to work with a number of governing bodies in adapting the approach and methodology to their areas. One such forum has resulted in discussions with two other AONBs, both of whom are working with us to adopt BETP in their location, one as part of a Heritage Lottery Funding programme.

Moreover, as the key findings and outputs of the project have implications for how and who defines, evaluates and measures tranquillity in a given area, other managing agencies and national governing bodies have shown interest in the work. Interests are particularly demonstrated in relation to implementing management plans and to authorities' duties in implementing the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the Environmental Noise Directive (END). Adopting the BETP to contribute to implementing END would mean adapting the framework to include urban areas for which our high resolution of 5mx5m models would serve studies in these intensively developed areas. 

At the local level, our partners, the team of the Dorset AONB, will be using the findings to implement their current management plan objectives for enhancing tranquillity in the AONB and to inform subsequent plans and policies. The results are timely and are currently assisting the AONB team in using the findings in their discussions with their partner local authorities on their implementation of directives under the National Planning Policy Framework, (NPPF) esp. Para: 123 that identifies a need to protect tranquil environments. One of these Authorities is currently consulting the findings in making decisions they need to take to complete their Preferred Options Document (part of the suite of planning documents required to create Local Plans that determine how the planning system will contribute to shaping the local community).

The collaborations and partnerships developed through the BET have further been progressed in the creation of another research project that will be concerned with health and wellbeing of the public and of a range of green spaces.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>657741CB-8B90-410D-B770-E98F05A512EA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55f1415381d450.85820464</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>BET contributes to national policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0222B28B-9DEC-4221-9766-B8A0F1EC4DF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Facilitating the implementation of national planning policy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6eca452f4b7.04210144</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contributing to content of Technical Briefing Note on Tranquillity - Landscape Institute</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BA9D399-9B49-4B73-AB5B-BCB6C3869AFD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6bd822daf95.81126823</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.landscapeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Tranquillity-An-Overview-1-DH.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Enhancing Working Practice - Dorset AONB Protected Area Management Team</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A60C8F5E-9C10-4F1C-A64E-58B4CEAC4E66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Until this point, understanding for tranquillity and specifically in the case study area, was a wholly unknown quantity for the team of the Dorset AONB.

This increased and extensive understanding for tranquillity is considered to improve the efficacy of decisions taken by the AONB team on balancing their environmental and social responsibilities with development matters.
