&lt;p>This project analyses the contracting of PMSCs by the United Nations (UN), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in three international military operations:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>the UN operation MONUC/MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the NATO ISAF mission in Afghanistan&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the EU mission ALTHEA in Bosnia-Herzegovina.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>By comparing the regulatory, operational and representational practices of the UN, NATO, the EU and their security contractors with regards to the provision of military and security services in these three operations, the project aims to identify which practices may have a negative impact on the achievement of mission objectives and which may be considered examples of ?best practice? which may be used as policy guidance for these and other organisations, companies and operations. Such guidance is particularly important as the use of PMSCs in multilateral interventions is likely to increase due to reductions in the national armed forces and military budgets of many UN, NATO and EU member states.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project benefits a broad range of public and business users. Since the UK Strategic Defence and Security Review (2010: 3) has identified the integration of civilian and military capabilities as a key strategy for conflict interventions the research is directly relevant to British policy makers. The project assists the government in its assessment of how the collaboration between international organizations and PMSCs affects its security objectives and policies as a major contributor to multilateral military operations. In addition, it advises policy makers on how the practices of PMSCs may be improved in order to answer public concerns about the UK as home state of a large PMSC industry. To achieve these aims the project provides the British government with new empirical data and analysis of the involvement and impact of PMSCs on multilateral military interventions. Importantly, its focus on the interaction between business and international organizational practices and how they shape the provision of security governance suggests new and creative solutions for improving the participation of PMSCs in military interventions, including but also going beyond national and international regulation.

The project is equally relevant to decision makers and planners in the UN, NATO and the EU as well as other international organizations involved in global security governance. Since the former have, until recently, hired PMSCs primarily to fill urgent operational requirements there is a lack of planning and knowledge with regard to the consequences. The research informs these organizations about the potential benefits and problems of this collaboration by identifying where the regulatory, operational and representation practices of PMSCs support or clash with their own and how this impacts on the realization of key mission objectives. It also supports international organizations in identifying best practices that enhance their interaction with PMSCs.

A third beneficiary are the national military contingents which carry out multilateral operations and interact directly with PMSCs. As a report by FINABEL (2008), the organization of the Chiefs of Staff of the Armies in Europe, suggests, military commanders are concerned about the wide variety of policies on PMSCs. The project helps to address these concerns by providing a comparative analysis of the regulatory and operational practices of the UN, NATO and the EU with regards to PMSCs. In addition, the research informs military leaders and planner about the distinct ways of thinking about and implementing security that characterize PMSCs and may impact on military interventions.

Finally, the project assists in making British PMSCs more successful in an increasingly competitive global market. The UK's security industry is the largest and most respected outside the US. Nevertheless, the downscaling of the interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan is forcing also British companies to search for new markets. The provision of services to international organizations and maritime operations has been identified as two areas for growth. So far, however, many international organizations have been reluctant to use PMSCs because of negative publicity and impacts on the ground. The project advises PMSCs on how they can improve their business practices in the areas of regulation, organization and representation. For this it has gained the support of ADS, the UK government's partner in the regulation of PMSCs, and the British Association of Private Security Companies (see letters of support). By reframing the issue of collaboration in terms of whether and what corporate practices undermine or support those of international organizations and their security objectives, the project suggests new ways of thinking about promoting their services that go beyond efficiency and effectiveness and give greater concern to their political, societal and security impacts in international interventions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>225251</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Expert panelist at a conference on civil security, organized by the Free University Berlin (Berlin)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8711F1C7-B61E-42FD-A6CE-6C3CC6457388</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I acted as an expert speaker on a panel on knowledge transfer between academic research on private security and the industry.

Among others, three key findings expand and revise existing knowledge. 
(1) One key finding is that contracting with PMSCs is highly dispersed and differentiated among multiple agencies within the UN, NATO and the EU. Previous research and public perception has therefore seriously underestimated the scale and importance of PMSC use by these organizations. In our three case studies -MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of Congo, ISAF in Afghanistan and EUFOR in Chad/CAR - PMSCs provided up to 95% of military and security support services. The consequences of this fragmentation are significant. Not only is there a lack of transparency and accountability since the true extent of PMSC contracting is 'hidden' within numerous and diverse budgets. In addition, different regulatory and contractual approaches, insufficient information exchange and sometimes even competition among individual agencies impede the control of PMSCs. 
(2) A second important result is that local PMSCs play a much larger role in UN, NATO and EU missions than is commonly assumed due to the focus on global companies such as Blackwater. While international PMSCs often serve as 'prime contractors', i.e. as managers of multi-service awards, a myriad of local subcontractors usually carry out the actual work. In particular, armed and unarmed security services are frequently provided by local companies and employees. One implication of local subcontracting is the dilution of regulatory and contractual control because of unclear lines of accountability and disputes over jurisdictional responsibility. Recent international efforts to (self)regulate PMSCs are also ineffective since they rarely apply to local firms. Another problem is the creation of indigenous security industries which undermine security sector reforms directed at demobilization, demilitarization and the creation of state monopolies on violence. Local security firms provide instead legal guises for the continued influence of armed militias, warlords and corrupt patronage networks.
(3) A third key finding regards the emergence of 'Security Risk Management' as a common approach shared by public and private security professionals. This finding confirms our theoretical propositions that the collaboration between the international organizations and PMSCs facilitates militarization and 'bunkerization', i.e. the seclusion of international missions behind barbed walls. Security Risk Management does so because it focusses exclusively on the protection of mission staff and perceives local civilians, who are the purported beneficiaries of the international interventions, primarily as a potential danger. International missions are thus increasingly armed and sealed off from their surroundings, while the environment is monitored by drones. Regulating PMSCs is viewed as a part of reputational risk management rather than as a mechanism for effectively protecting local civilians from human rights abuses. As a consequence Security Risk Management contributes to undermining the ability of international missions to win the 'hearts and minds' of host populations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research outcomes have important implications for academic research, policy makers, UN, NATO and EU practitioners, PMSC industry and the general public. First, they show that international organizations play a central and growing role in the use and regulation of PMSCs in multilateral military interventions. Second, they identify the creation of local security industries in conflict regions as a major obstacle to mission objectives and long-term peace and stability. Third, they highlight that new regulations are ineffective if they focus on international PMSCs. To engage with our beneficiaries we have pursued diverse dissemination strategies, involving academic articles, policy reports, conference papers, the media, public debates, expert panel presentations at the UN and the EU, and a concluding project workshop with representatives from all stakeholder groups. Our findings have already been taken forward in several ways. The UN has revised its regulations for private security firms to apply also to unarmed local companies in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. Transparency International has submitted our report on PMSCs for discussion at the international Munich Security Conference 2016. The European Parliament has investigated the EU's collaboration with PMSCs by inviting us to speak to its Security and Defence Committee.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>64FEEB37-0957-4044-BDB3-E9CC6C3F88B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb72d51c7d5.70117855</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9EF507A0-ED7B-4F1F-9573-D0F32B1129CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>ESRC - Britain in 2015</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/14d79310cb2736a196ed350ccfe80d35"><gtr:id>14d79310cb2736a196ed350ccfe80d35</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Krahmann, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb1c6573048.42741230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2DAF3EE8-3276-4606-9DC4-0B6D47ECCBF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Undermining Human Security: Private Security Companies, the APPF, Militias and Auxiliary Police in Afghanistan</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/14d79310cb2736a196ed350ccfe80d35"><gtr:id>14d79310cb2736a196ed350ccfe80d35</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Krahmann, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-942532-78-5</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56ddacee77f8f2.38797646</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1440A4AD-15B5-4706-A7C8-56DF9FE82E12</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prinzipal-Agent-Beziehungen und Dritte.
