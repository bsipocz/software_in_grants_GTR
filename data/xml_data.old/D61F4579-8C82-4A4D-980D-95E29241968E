The main hypothesis of this project is that Southern European countries are undergoing a crisis of legitimation. Citizens' democratic dissatisfaction is the consequence of a responsiveness gap: that is, citizens' perception that governments are not responding to their demands anymore. The project will study how this crisis of representation and legitimation is taking place and its consequences. More specifically, the project answers to three main questions:

1. What explains democratic dissatisfaction in Southern Europe? This part of the project will test the core argument: the crisis of legitimation stems from national governments not being responsive to citizens' mandate given the institutional constraints of euro membership. One of the key principles of democratic systems is to provide an alternative to voters if they believe that the government has not performed well enough. The argument put forward here is that the crisis has undermined this essential function of voting in Southern Europe: elections are not able to generate governments in which political parties become a real alternative to each other. 

2. What is the impact of democratic dissatisfaction on attitudes towards national democracy? The project will argue that the increase in democratic dissatisfaction and the breakup of the representation link has a strong impact on attitudes in several dimensions of national-level politics: 1) austerity policies have an impact in the expectations that citizens have from a democratic system and make citizens depart from a liberal and minimal view on democracy to conceive democracies more as a result, placing more weight on the social rights of citizens 2) the project will also test whether the crisis of legitimation increases the demand for institutions of direct democracy; 3) the project will account for whether, as a result of this representation breakup, some citizens have become less engaged with politics and others have become more mobilised. In doing this, differences between the countries of analysis will also be explored. 

3. How does democratic dissatisfaction shape attitudes towards the European Union and the euro in Southern Europe? The project will assess the implications of the crisis in terms of the support and views about the European Union project and also the conditions under which citizens of Southern Europe would support a breakup of the Eurozone. This last stream of the project will fill two main gaps in the discipline: to provide an updated account of citizens' motivations to support the euro and open a new avenue of research on the support for debt repayment and the conditions of bailout agreements.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are four types of beneficiaries of the project: 1) organisations working on social rights and political mobilization in Greece and Spain 2) public policy think tanks analysing the consequences of the crisis 3) the Spanish and Greek governments and the EU institutions 4) academics working in a broad range of areas such as the Eurozone financial crisis, political mobilization, attitudes towards democracy and political disaffection. 
To reach all the aforementioned groups the impact strategy will proceed in the following steps: 
1. A key set stakeholders and practitioners will be invited to be part of an advisory group. This group will have continuous information on the development of the project, and will be able to provide on-going feedback in regular meetings. Fundamental stakeholders will be Fundaci&amp;oacute;n Alternativas, which is the main think tank on policy-making in Spain, the Greek Public Policy Forum, a think tank and network created to study the recent developments in Greece. 
2. The advisory group will be a gateway to other practitioners. 
3. A project's website will be launched before January 2017
4. The project's website will host a blog in which I will regularly post about the development of the project and will comment on on-going results. Academic experts and non-academic practitioners will also post regularly about the crisis and its consequences The website and the blog will be a strategic instrument to reach journalists and media, but also stakeholders, academics, and the general public to inform the political debate on the political crisis in Southern Europe.
5. In collaboration with Fundacion Alternativas and the Greek Public Policy Forum, a first round of roundtables will be organised to launch the project.
6. A first practitioners' workshop will be organised as part of the Annual Meetings of the Greek Public Policy. This workshop will bring together stakeholders from international and national institutions and will focus on the relation between upra-national institutions, policy-making and citizen's attitudes.
7. Once the first wave of research data have been produced, a series of public discussion forums will be organised in each country of study. The events will invite policy practitioners, academics, research participants, national media and the general public and bring them into conversation with the findings of the research. 
8. The project will include a media engagement plan to enable the delivery of its results through conventional media. Targeted press releases, issued via The University of York Press office, will also be sent to local and national media outlets documenting preliminary and final findings
9. A regular newsletter will update on the development of the project. 
10. Executive summaries will be sent to all major civic, social, economic, and democratic organisations in Greece, Spain, and the EU. In collaboration with the research assistant, there will also be a programme of one-to-one briefings to personally disseminate the research results. 
11. A two-day conference on democratic dissatisfaction in Southern Europe at the end of the project will be organised in Brussels with representatives of the EU institutions, Greek and Spanish organisations, and media. 
12. Two policy papers will be written as a result of these activities and the knowledge exchange placement. 
13. The project will make use of social media and will collaborate with consolidated sources of online dissemination such as the LSE blogs, and specific sources in the countries of analysis like Piedras de Papel (Paper Stones), Politikon, or Peripheral Vision (hosted in Ekathimerini).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150276</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N01734X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B64449A8-2468-4FB4-A7C4-D0D95891E5B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Elections/Electoral studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E889DE6C-93D7-4BC9-92AA-7A4698F7D850</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat Political Economy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
