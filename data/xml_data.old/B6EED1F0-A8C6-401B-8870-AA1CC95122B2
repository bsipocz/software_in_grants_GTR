Due to animal welfare concern, a ban on pig castration will be introduced in 2018 in Europe. This will lead to a dramatic increase in tainted carcasses entering food chain and associated economic losses. The applicants in collaboration with industry developed a prototype of a unique cost-effective technology for on-line detection of boar taint; undertook extensive market evaluation; filed a European patent application and identified potential licensees. The technology has been further improved following industry feedback and validated on meat samples against the &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot;. However, the industry is not prepared to progress licensing negotiations until the technological aspects are fully addressed and the technology is evaluated in abattoir setting. This project will close the technology &amp;quot;gaps&amp;quot;, evaluate the technology in industrial setting and facilitate the technology commercialisation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>170910</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Hohenheim</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of Hohenheim Germany</gtr:description><gtr:id>50B96C33-65FD-42C7-BE68-96CC7C9D472C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

Improvements to the technology have been made taking into account the pig producing industry and other stakeholders feedback. An EU Patent application has received a positive feedback from European Patent Examiner and is in a process of completion. Discussions have been held with national and international companies regarding producing a pre-commercial technology prototype. On-line evaluation of the technology will be undertaken in April-May 2017. The University has identified a number of potential licensees and has been leading discussions regarding licensing agreements to ensure that the technology is on the UK and international market as soon as possible.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The new technology for boar taint detection will allow instantly identify tainted carcasses on-line and prevent entry of these carcasses to the food chain. Therefore this technology will make critical contribution to implementation of the EU Legislation of Voluntary Ban on Pig Castration as a preventive measure for boar taint. The legislation is due to be implemented in January 2018. Results of this research might be taken forward by national and international community to use the principle of the boar taint detector for the development of other technologies for agri-food, biomedical, security, environmental and other applications. The boar taint detecting technology will benefit animal welfare (as it will be facilitating implementation of alternatives to pig castration) and will be of direct benefit to farmers, pig breeders and abattoirs. Outcomes of this research will also contribute to teaching programmes at all the levels and will facilitate international cooperation</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2D68ADFD-737A-4B1C-8749-B7719D2203E4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bfea7ab7c7b9.17363236</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>38508A9E-E1DE-4160-B7C6-8CDE276EA0BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Voltammetric analysis of vitamins B1, B2, and B6 using screen-printed carbon electrodes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8e78256e5e909dff4052525f3de9b4cc"><gtr:id>8e78256e5e909dff4052525f3de9b4cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Westmacott K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be806e904d78.24143352</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE3A6B36-8177-4F14-85F2-173479C892B9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Polymorphisms of the porcine cathepsins, growth hormone-releasing hormone and leptin receptor genes and their association with meat quality traits in Ukrainian Large White breed.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular biology reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9889ab376f4a1babfb7d27c765a81d51"><gtr:id>9889ab376f4a1babfb7d27c765a81d51</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Balatsky V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0301-4851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d42dc68dc53.47733328</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>81C8F927-644C-44AE-950A-0A1F3F68DFEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Influence of betaine and arginine supplementation of reduced protein diets on fatty acid composition and gene expression in the muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue of cross-bred pigs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The British journal of nutrition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3a061835d3f3911ca20552dd5fe83f09"><gtr:id>3a061835d3f3911ca20552dd5fe83f09</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Madeira MS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1145</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56af4731cd46a3.23623589</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>866C97DE-146C-4983-926C-69217D8D59B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Studies towards the development of a novel electrochemical sensor array for the analysis of vitamins in meat</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8e78256e5e909dff4052525f3de9b4cc"><gtr:id>8e78256e5e909dff4052525f3de9b4cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Westmacott K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be7fba35a1f0.10837475</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P004725/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
