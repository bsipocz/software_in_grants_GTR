The second-century Roman writer Tacitus is considered one of antiquity's premier historians. Annals 11 covers the years AD 47 and 48 and is the first of two surviving books that treats the reign of the Roman emperor Claudius. It is a crucial source for Rome's internal and foreign affairs of the period. My edition, aimed at a scholarly audience, will contain a wide-ranging introduction that examines the value of the manuscripts containing Annals 11; Tacitus' characterisation of the emperor Claudius; and the structure and chronology of Annals 11. I shall produce a Latin text and full critical apparatus, which will enable readers to trace changes to the text to their manuscript or scholarly source. My comprehensive commentary will examine issues arising from the Latin text, Tacitus' style and use of language, and wide range of historical subjects: political, religious, economic, social, cultural, legal, and institutional. I shall introduce newly-discovered historical evidence relevant to Annals 11 and offer new interpretations of that and existing ancient evidence, and an assessment of existing scholarship. During my Fellowship I shall finish my edition by producing the Latin text and critical apparatus of and commentary on 11.11, 13-15. The principal themes of these chapters are Claudius' celebration of the Saecular games; the popular favour shown to the future emperor Nero; Claudius' tenure of one of Rome's most distinguished Republican magistracies, the Censorship, and his acts as Censor. One such act, Claudius' introduction of letters to the Latin alphabet, prompts Tacitus to write a digression on the history of the alphabet.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My work's focus on Claudius is a principal reason why it is likely to appeal to members of the public outside academic research circles: Tacitus is a primary source for the reign of Claudius; Claudius is one of the better known Roman emperors among lay audiences; and Claudius is particularly well known in the U.K. for his historic role as conqueror of Britain.

In view of this, museum, library, and auction-house staff will find my edition of Tacitus Annals 11 valuable. Since these professionals have to cover a wide range of materials, they rely on general works and often outdated reference works. They need access to up-to-date knowledge in fields familiar to them and guidance in those that are not, but they often do not have time to read widely. They need knowledge to be collected for them, presented clearly, and they need guidance for further reading. My edition will provide an outstanding point of reference about Claudius and his reign from an acknowledged authority in the field because of its thorough treatment of broad themes of Claudius' reign (e.g. foreign policy in relation to Germany and the Near East; religion at Rome), its full bibliography of further reading, and its user-friendly format. As evidence that such professionals do use specialist literature to inform their work for an even wider public audience, I can point to Sotheby's use of and reference to my article on the death of Ptolemy of Mauretania under the Roman emperor Caligula (see my list of publications) in a catalogue note on a bronze portrait head of Ptolemy of Mauretania in their Egyptian, Classical, and Western Antiquities auction catalogue of December 2004.

As the only scholar in the U.K. working on the Claudian books of Tacitus' Annals I am in a good position to act as a consultant for media products on the Roman emperors of the first century AD.

My in-depth analysis of Tacitus' use of Latin will benefit translators of Tacitus into modern languages.
