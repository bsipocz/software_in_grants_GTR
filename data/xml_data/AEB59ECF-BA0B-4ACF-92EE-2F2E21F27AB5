In terms of the public experience of community policing, the common elements of the strategy tend to be: police foot patrols rather than vehicle patrols; community meetings attended by the police; beat officers who are assigned to a neighbourhood, who have responsibility for that area, and will be a point of contact for community relations in the area; and a problem-solving approach to local issues, often in partnership with other public services, which attempts to get to the root of local problems rather than simply responding to crime by arresting individual offenders.\n\nCommunity policing is therefore a model distinct from the more usual 'response' or 'fire-brigade' policing whereby the police answer calls for service. Community policing is part of the service the police offer in Scotland, but they are still predominantly response-oriented. Scotland's forces do, however, recognise the significant successes and public popularity of community policing in other jurisdictions, and are moving towards expanding their provision of community policing, based on an identification of best practice in comparative models. \n\nThis knowledge transfer project involves academic criminologists working with the City of Edinburgh community police and their senior officers to identify and develop future directions for community policing in Scotland. The programme consists of a series of workshops, the results of which will be disseminated across Scotland's police forces, as well as UK-wide and internationally. These workshops will involve:\n\n1. discussions of current community policing practice in Scotland, including implementation difficulties\n2. exploration of the conceptual basis of community policing, and how the concept has been turned into practice in comparative jurisdictions (including identification of ambiguities in interpretation of the idea of community policing, and development of a focus on what is of core importance in the Scottish context, which will help in negotiating these ambiguities)\n3. attempts to unravel and resolve current known problems in community policing in Scotland\n4. identification of problems which are not widely known, and explorations of possible solutions to these problems\n5. dissemination of key outcomes of the workshops throughout Scotland's police, and beyond. \n\nCommunity policing if performed effectively can have considerable social benefits. These include reductions in crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour; increasing feelings of safety among members of the public; improvements in police-community relations; improvements in joined-up problem-solving approaches to neighbourhood problems between local councils, the police, and other agencies; and greatly increased opportunities for community members to become involved in influencing the policing agenda to meet their identified neighbourhood needs. \n\nThe transformational potential of the project is captured in Skogan's (2004) ten- year evaluation of Chicago's community policing strategy, which 'was intended to be transformational: that is, it was designed to change the way in which the entire department and even city government did its business... it weaves responsibility for problem solving into the daily routine of beat officers and integrates them into the fabric of the community. It created a mechanism by which the public can influence and monitor the work of officers in their neighbourhood... immensely popular with the public, community policing has become the routine way in which Chicagoans expect police services to be delivered.'</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>141398</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Police research Institutes Collaboration (EPIC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>KE stream in EPIC</gtr:description><gtr:id>8AE41DDB-84BB-40BA-A3B6-707E65B69004</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95a2ff8b95a300c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>We are the invited co-ordinators of the Knowledge Exchange work stream in the European Police research Institutes Collaboration (EPIC).

Over the course of the three year project we engaged in a wide range of knowledge exchange activities, culminating in the third year in the development of 'the Edinburgh Police Research and Practice Group' (EPRPG). The EPRPG set up and hosted a series of twelve seminars and workshops in 2011, based around a collegial presentation-and-discussion format with attendance from a cross section of the Scottish public sector concerned with policing, including academics and council representatives as well as a wide range of attendance from the police themselves, from community beat officers to the chief constable. The EPRPG was the practical culmination of our investigations into the most effective knowledge exchange mechanism for bringing together the evidence base constituted by national and international policing research studies with the practical day to day concerns of the police as practitioners. We have also produced (and are continuing to produce) evidence summaries (e.g. an evidence review on community policing published through the Scottish Government), theoretical interpretations of the role of community policing in the wider contemporary policy landscape around steering and activating communities (e.g. presentations we have made on the concept of the 'security ritual' and a journal article in preparation setting out that orientation), and perhaps most importantly reflections on and development of the theory of knowledge 'transfer' or 'exchange' itself (see our article in Police Practice and Research). The project has therefore had an impact on the development of scientific approaches to knowledge exchange as well as a practical legacy for ourselves and our partner police agency through the continuation of the EPRPG and the further development, with some additional funding, of a high-level policy forum for knowledge exchange in policing by way of the 'executive sessions' model of collaboration.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has been primarily about making research evidence more accessible to non-academic policing audiences, and the models of knowledge exchange we have developed and have set out in our project publications are of broad relevance to academics from many different disciplines seeking to collaborate with the police or similar organisations around the idea of increasing integration and two-way information flow between academic evidence and practice in policy-oriented public agencies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5616C846-0861-4B7E-8B2D-917E836B173B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7102711002.43806775ed1ae</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Policy influence</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>34AB5B86-4E25-44C0-976D-47BB66B1D898</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Evidence reviews and theoretical papers for national government readership, and through the publication of the evidence review on community policing by the Scottish Government, which has achieved a wide international readership, we have become involved in the development of community policing research and policy in other countries at the invitation of local researchers.
