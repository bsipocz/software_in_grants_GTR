Every year a total of 605,000 tonnes of top fruit are sold in the UK every year. The UK apple industry is worth &amp;pound;190m at retail and supports many jobs in the industry directly, on farms and in transport. To achieve year round apple supply 145,000 tonnes of apples (24% of total volume) are typically stored for ca. 6 months each season depending on variety. The supply of UK grown top fruit is therefore restricted to a 26 week marketing window from September to end of March due to late stored fruit not competing in quality terms with new season Southern Hemisphere fruit. Apple cv. Gala represents 50% of the industry but is threatened by foreign imports in late season, when the flavour can deteriorate, despite firmness and Brix readings remaining above retailer requirements. This represents a current and tangible risk to the sustainability of supply of some important UK-grown varieties (e.g. cvs. Gala and Braeburn).With the UK Gala tonnage ca. 60,000 tonnes, there is a need to expand the marketing window, whilst continuing to offer the consumer a premium product. In addition to supply, lower grade UK fruit in April/May would turn the consumer away from re-purchase for an 8 week window thus affecting total sales. Furthermore, a recent increase of 20% volume in the UK has culminated in a -4% decline in values given the limited marketing window and high participation in promotions to move the fruit through the supply chain. The supply of UK grown fruit is predicted to increase by a further 14% in the next 3 years (20,000 tonnes). The challenge is therefore to extend the season into April /May without compromising the consumer experience in term of quality of purchase. A better understanding of how the flavour of British apple fruit can be better maintained would provide an opportunity to implement appropriate technologies and extend the Britishseason, reduce the reliance on imports where there could be competition (e.g. cv. Gala and Braeburn). The project sets out to implement physiologically targeted modified atmosphere technologies together with the unique allied models of temporal changes in flavour. The Consortium
envisage that, notwithstanding the potential financial and environmental benefit of displacing imports, that the desired extension of 6 weeks sought within this research would equate to an additional &amp;pound;10m at retail for UK cv. Gala fruit alone. This sum would increase when extended to other important UK-grown apple cultivars (e.g. Braeburn, Rubens, Kanzi and Evelina). Extending 'flavour-life' and decreasing the incidence of internal disorders of UK-derived apple fruit would increase availability, safeguard associated jobs, support the UK Government's self-sufficiency agenda, reduce waste and help protect the UK's thousand-year heritage in growing apples.It is expected that the project will act as a catalyst for a paradigm shift in the way UK apples are stored whereby postharvest storage technologies are physiologically targeted and focussed on maintaining 'flavour-life' as opposed to using blanket treatments throughout storage for life extension alone.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>354956</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P004938/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C5107770-461D-42E3-B991-48AE97DF206F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8EB9BB59-B7EF-4C3B-9170-233BADFF3D7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food structure/composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>15080F45-1EA3-41B4-BC23-C49CB918FBC4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
