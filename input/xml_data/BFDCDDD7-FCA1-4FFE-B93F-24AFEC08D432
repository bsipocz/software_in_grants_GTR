Performers of the self-styled classical German school of string playing in 1840 - 1900 will have realised notation very differently from modern musicians.\n\nA number of 'historically aware' performers have incorporated some known historical nineteenth-century performance traits in their performances. However, such historical interest has been secondary to the imperative to satisfy modern notions of taste, and where scholarship has revealed radical differences compared to current ideals, such characteristics have been underplayed or omitted. Use of portamento and pronounced tempo fluctions are good examples. Thus, in the interests of selling records that placate rather than challenge modern tastes, 'historically aware' performances of nineteenth century music are only influenced by disparate and selectively applied strands of nineteenth century performance aesthetics. Although such approaches are often stimulating and interesting in themselves, they lack substantial basis in performance scholarship and might even be seen, indeed, as a 'post modern' desire to re-use older aesthetic ideals, rather than as attempts to re-awaken older traditions and aesthetic languages.\n\nThis project, conducted outside the commercial domain by scholar-performers, aims to focus upon re-creating the performing styles of the German school of playing in the period from Mendelssohn's later years up to 1900, without such compromises. It will focus purely upon historical evidence, mainly in the form of performance scores and applied early recordings, against the backdrop of developed scholarship by the applicant, Clive Brown, Robin Stowell, Robert Phillip and others. The project will attempt, for the first time on any significant scale, a performance investigation of key chamber works as performed by players of the German school in this important musical epoch. Undertaken with rigorous scholarship and within the framework of Leeds University Centre for Historically Informed Performance (LUCHIP) the project will examine important scores, written sources and early recordings to piece together and record performances of key works reconstructing not only general chronological/geographical style traits, but also the specific approaches of prominent, well-documented performers, chief amongst whom will be Ferdinand David, Joseph Joachim, Leopold Auer and Arnold Rose. Although there are a number of early recordings of Joachim, Auer and Rose, for example, technological limitations prevented the recording of larger-scale chamber works. This project will attempt to transfer knowledge from early recordings to such larger works, applying in-depth historical performance scholarship.\n\nThe result will be a range of fascinating performances, capturing, as faithfully as is possible, likely playing styles of this most vibrant and important of musical epochs. The project moreover will demonstrate how the application of known practices for this reportoire can affect our perception of the music. Just as annotated editions and early recordings can teach us much about performance of their times, so too can this archive be a potent teaching tool to elucidate playing styles of this period and tradition, in order to resource present performance of this reportoire in a creative, historical way. The project thus has a very potential to influence future genrations of performance, particularly in view of the incompleteness of present 'historically aware' commercial performance adn teh somewhat static nature of current 'mainstream' playing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>191913</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D502381/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
