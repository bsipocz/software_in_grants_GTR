Premised on the idea that governance cannot eliminate all adverse outcomes, risk-based approaches take into account both the probability as well as the impact of potential adverse governance outcomes. In so doing, such approaches provide a means of rationalising the limits of what governance interventions can, and should, achieve. However, such approaches embody particular understandings about the meaning of governance 'failure' and 'success' and as such can conflict with governance norms and accountability structures as well as societal expectations.&lt;br />&lt;br />HowSAFE will undertake a comparative investigation of the factors shaping the adoption of risk-based approaches to governance across six policy domains-occupational health and safety, flooding, food-safety, healthcare, criminal justice and education - in four European countries-France, Germany, Netherlands and UK. In so doing, it will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>document the application of risk-based governance across policy domains and national settings&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>compare the application of risk instruments within and between policy domains&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>explain the factors driving and constraining risk-based governance in Europe, and will reflect more broadly on how states account for failure and the limits of governance.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>HowSAFE will contribute to policy practice in UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as international bodies such as the OECD and EC. The detailed and wider lessons-learned from the case-study research will help foster reflexive learning by policy practitioners across policy domains and country contexts. Given the emphasis on establishing risk-based approaches to governance across the EU, such research has the potential to identify institutional factors that shape or constrain their adoption. For example, the comparative analysis of risk-based concepts that appear to have common application across sectors (e.g. education, food and criminal justice) will help decision-makers to better understand, reappraise, maybe even discard practices enshrined in their respective sectors.

expect to engage with the scholarly community through project working papers and policy reviews that will be made widely available through a project website and disseminated through international conference presentations and peer reviewed publication, including a monograph that synthesizes the cross-country and domain analysis of the project, an edited book on risk-based regulation, and specialist and international academic journal articles.

We will also generate a series of short policy briefs conveying key findings to policy and stakeholder audiences in the four countries, as well as holding three dissemination workshops at the end of the project in Brussels (Maastricht University campus), Paris and Berlin. Those workshops will bring together policy practitioners and selected stakeholders from different domains to discuss HowSAFE and promote reflexive learning across domains. In common with past research experience, we would expect policy interest to go beyond central policy or evaluation units to those in the 'front line' of regulatory enforcement and implementation. 

To facilitate both research and impact activities, we will make use of informal project advisory boards in each country comprising invited senior policy practitioners and other experts with an interest in risk-based governance and in-depth knowledge of case study domains. To go beyond contacts made during the research, we will also draw upon existing networks such as: Borraz's presidency of the French Risk and Society Network; the Kings Centre for Risk Management's established network of senior policy and industry contacts; and the ESRC funded Centre for Analysis of Risk and Regulation's established platform.

All project related materials will be made widely available through an actively maintained project website. In addition, an end of project conference in London will bring academic and policy audiences together and we anticipate considerable interest from policy and stakeholder groups.

A minimum of three project advisory board meetings will be held in each country throughout the life of the project both to facilitate the research process and to advise on how to maximise impacts of project findings. Drawing on past experience of ESRC research, regular informal contacts with domain specialist advisory board members can provide invaluable feedback on progress and suggestions for research directions and dissemination routes. We would also hope to feed into, and capitalise upon, ongoing comparative reviews of risk governance in some of the case study countries and international fora.

Dissemination workshops will be held in Paris, Berlin and Maastricht during the third year of the project and a major conference in London will be organised at the end of the project to bring academic and user groups together.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>386109</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ECPR Standing Group for Regulatory Governance Conference, Barcelona, June 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D826F4A9-B613-49C3-8BFE-9064E63849FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organised a panel dedicated to the HowSAFE project comprising five papers given by members of the UK and other partner teams.

Our comparative European research shows that the meanings of, and relationships between, risk and regulation significantly vary according to national traditions and norms of governance in at least three ways (Rothstein et al 2015;2016;2017):

i) Constitutional Settings: The utilitarian conceit of risk-based regulation is favoured in polities that emphasise consequentialist justifications of regulatory action but struggles in more rights-based polities that, for example, emphasise equality;

ii) Legal Cultures: While anglo-saxon commentators like to portray goals of eliminating risk as hallmarks of continental European precaution, they miss the point that while anglo-saxon countries with common law traditions of legal literalism struggle with goals of zero risk, civil law countries treat headline law as only aspirational and secondary to detailed rules that give effect to such goals;

iii) State Traditions: In the UK, risk is invoked to limit regulatory interventions of an otherwise sovereign parliament; in the German Rechtsstaat, risk is invoked as an enabling justification for regulatory interference with constitutionally protected private rights; in the Dutch consociational polity, risk is invoked as a principal for brokering regulatory conflict; while in France risk is invoked to justify interventions that reinforce the legitimacy and protective duties of the State.


FINDING 2: 

Our comparative UK research across policy domains shows that there are at least three institutional preconditions for successful risk-based regulation:

i) Regulatory goals need to be unambiguous and stable in order to frame and calibrate regulatory interventions in terms of risk;

ii) Trade-offs between regulatory goals have to be amenable to ex ante agreement on defining acceptable risk and there has to be tolerance ex post when adverse outcomes occur; 

iii) Regulators must be able to reliably assess the probability and consequences of adverse outcomes.

Workplace health and safety regulation is one example of meeting such preconditions, having been framed in risk-based terms for over 40 years in the context of stable goals, the common interest of employers and employees in agreeing trade-offs between cost and safety, and a regulator whose expertise is widely commended (Demeritt et al. 2015). Such preconditions have proved harder to meet in flooding, where ex ante agreement on trade-offs can be undermined by political populism when floods occur, and in food safety, where it is hard to reach even ex ante agreement on trade-offs amongst multiple interest groups and consumers. Finally, such preconditions have proved almost impossible in regulating the quality of healthcare and higher education providers in the absence of stable agreement on even the goals of each regime (Beaussier et al 2016).


FINDING 3: 

Big data doesn't necessarily mean better regulation:

Our ground-breaking quantitative analyses of enthusiastic attempts by regulators to use statistical surveillance tools to identify risks to healthcare and higher education quality found that big data was at best, of limited value and, at worst, misleading (Griffiths et al 2016). Some of the reasons include the difficulty of finding data that has the right character and is of sufficient reliability to capture the problems addressed by regulators (Beaussier et al 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are two principal ways in which our findings should be taken forwards:

1. Our comparative European research on how ideas of risk and regulation are refracted through national traditions and norms of governance have a particular salience in the context of Brexit and the need for government to understand what is at stake in a wide range of risk regulation issues when renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU. We think that our publications are starting to form the basis for an intellectually novel as well as policy relevant research agenda that could be expanded both in terms of widening the selection of policy domains as well as non-EU country case-studies. 

2. Our quantitative statistical analyses that have shown how data-driven approaches to risk-based regulation have failed in healthcare and higher education quality regulation have already led the Quality Assurance Agency and the Care Quality Commission to rethink the way that they prioritise their inspections. We are now building on that novel research and working relationships that we have developed with UK regulators to prepare a new research proposal on the use of big data by regulators as well as in wider government contexts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>58EB9785-3192-41AA-9673-9F2B96690D56</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56debbcc81e732.61226544</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/geography/research/Research-Domains/Risk-and-Society/projects/howsafe/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Critique of the Care Quality Commission's 'Intelligent Monitoring' statistical surveillance system</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>214E8C7B-EE1A-41B7-9088-71485203FDC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We contributed the findings of our research on the Care Quality Commission's 'Intelligent Monitoring' statistical surveillance to the Health Select Committee's Care Quality Commission Accountability Review. Our research, which was published in BMJ Quality and Safety in 2016, was the first peer-reviewed assessment of the 'Intelligent Monitoring' system which was used by the CQC to monitor health and social care providers and to identify those that should be prioritised for inspection and improvement. Our groundbreaking analysis showed that the Intelligent Monitoring system was unable to detect which hospital trusts were delivering poor quality care, with its predictions of hospital quality being wrong more often than they were right. That research was also reported in a dedicated article in the weekly Health Service Journal (14.3.2017), which is widely read among managers in the NHS.

While HEFCE did not publish our (or anyone else's) consultation response, its subsequent publication of its revised operating model for quality assessment indicated that HEFCE now accepted that crude metrics-driven approaches to identifying failing institutions do not work (See paragraph 109, p28 of its 'Revised operating model

&amp;quot;Throughout this process, the relevant funding body will remain mindful of the complexities involved in making judgements about a higher education provider's performance, and will recognise that data analysis and dialogue in these circumstances needs to be robust, sophisticated and nuanced. It is particularly important to note here that we are not advocating a crude metrics-driven approach, using data to predict providers that might or might not have received successful outcomes under previous quality assessment approaches.
