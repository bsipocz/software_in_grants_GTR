Yet, while we celebrate Shakespeare's language, its study suffers neglect, relative to literary and cultural studies. Moreover, no study of Shakespeare has deployed the latest methods used by today's linguists to interrogate large electronic collections of texts (corpora) in a comprehensive way. The Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare's Language project will fill this gap, bringing scholarship on Shakespeare's language fully into the 21st century.

The premier reference for historical English language, the Oxford English Dictionary, is limited with respect to Shakespeare's language. Firstly, since its entries for the relevant period are often based on Shakespeare's works, they provide no independent perspective. Second, it prioritises etymology, rather than thoroughly examining how Shakespeare actually used language, with reference to its contexts and effects. Onions' (1911) glossary of Shakespeare follows this tradition. Moreover, all Shakespearean dictionaries, including Crystal and Crystal (2004), define words in terms of synonyms. The word horrid, for example, is glossed with words such as 'horrifying' and 'terrifying'. However, Shakespeare is more specific: he typically uses horrid to refer to fear caused by supernatural or unnatural acts, sights and sounds. The Encyclopaedia will use frequency information and linguistic context to reveal subtle patterns of meaning and usage, which have eluded Shakespearean scholarship.

A unique feature of the encyclopaedia is that comparisons are at its heart. Internal comparisons will reveal how Shakespeare's language varies. For instance, we will show how certain words, meanings, and structures are peculiar to tragedies, comedies or histories; to social groups; and to specific periods. For example, the exclamation ah, signalling emotional distress or pity, is characteristic of the histories, and occurs more than twice as densely in the speech of female characters compared with male. Moreover, state-of-the-art techniques will be used to compare Shakespeare's use of language with a 321-million-word corpus consisting of Early Modern texts across all extant genres, 1580 to 1640. These external comparisons will enable discovery not only of specific uses characteristic of Shakespeare, but also of the 'flavour' of particular items (e.g. whether certain words were considered colloquial, religious, courteous, etc.). For example, Ah is used relatively frequently by Shakespeare, compared with his contemporaries, and, despite being characteristic of the histories, is strongly colloquial in flavour, occurring densely in speech-related genres (e.g. trial proceedings). 

The major output from the project will be a two-volume encyclopaedia, designed to be accessible to a wide range of users. The first volume will focus on words, including multi-word expressions. For example, Shakespeare had a penchant for using multi-word expressions beginning with the pronoun I (e.g. 'I pray you') - something which gives insight into an important mechanism of his dialogue. The second volume will focus on patterns of words and how they constitute idiolects for characters, sociolects for groups of characters and themes for plays and groups of plays (tragedies/comedies/histories). For example, Juliet's idiolect features words such as if and yet - words that reflect her anxieties. 

The encyclopaedia will be launched in three versions: paper, web-based and as an app. Moreover, the project will make available both its comprehensively annotated Shakespeare texts and its work on the comparative data, and provide various training opportunities and resources (e.g. youtube videos, a miniMOOC) on how to use them. Users will be able to pursue their own specific research interests.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Three non-academic user groups will derive particular benefit from our project:

(1) General public and the media. The timing of our project coincides with a period of heightened global interest in Shakespeare, sparked not least by the anniversary of his birth in 2014 and the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016. Our research will benefit the multitude of members of the public who take a keen interest in Shakespeare by reading the plays, going to see performances, watching plays or films on television, visiting exhibitions, and so on. It will deepen their appreciation of Shakespeare's work, and help magnify the global benefit for the United Kingdom. We have already commenced work with the media, notably the BBC, who are actively preparing for 2016 celebrations and beyond.

(2) Education users. Concurrent with the international celebration of Shakespeare in 2016 is the implementation of the revised national curriculum, which gives Shakespeare more prominence at secondary level. Our research is designed to offer teachers and students new insights and opportunities for exploring Shakespeare's language. For example, students will be able to use the app version of the encyclopaedia, a medium with which they are highly familiar, to unlock Shakespeare's language in near real time in the classroom. 

(3) Professional users. These comprise two groups. One is theatre practitioners, from directors to actors. We will help these users enhance their practice by exploiting our new, empirically based interpretations of Shakespeare's language in its contemporary contexts. For example, RSC Director Greg Doran reported that the company had been unsure of the sense of word 'beshrew' in recent rehearsal of Henry IV (Pt.2). PI Culpeper had responded to Doran, showing that no current Shakespearean dictionary did justice to the actual meaning of 'beshrew'. The other group is curators and other professionals working in museums and galleries at international, national and local levels with Shakespeare connections or holdings (e.g. The Folger Institute; Shakespeare Centre; The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust; the British Library; and numerous regional exhibition spaces). We will help these users better understand what exactly they are curating. They will benefit especially from our comparative work, assessing the distinctiveness of Shakespeare's language relative to his contemporaries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>797996</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare's Language Twitter</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9D43BDA-4A02-4843-86BB-ACDBA62901D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project Twitter account aims to:
