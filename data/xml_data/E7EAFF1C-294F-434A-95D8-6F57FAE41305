&lt;p>The main purpose of this project is to examine the hypothesis that such baby-talk words (BTWs) are functionally motivated by their typical phonological properties, including reduplication (eg, 'wee-wee', 'din-din'), lack of clusters (eg, 'tummy' cf. 'stomach') and recurrent ending patterns (eg, the /i/ ending in 'doggy', 'kitty'etc.). Words with these phonological characteristics are thought to be easier to detect and learn, offering an entry point to lexical learning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two major predictions that follow from this hypothesis:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>infants should detect and learn novel words faster when they have phonological characteristics associated with BTWs than when they lack such properties&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>because infants who are initially exposed to more learnable words are likely to break into lexical learning earlier than others, they should acquire more words during the initial stages of lexical development. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>These predictions will be tested through laboratory-based word learning experiments and longitudinal analysis of the relationship between BTW input and infants' naturalistic lexical development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond its direct academic contributions to our understanding of the role of baby-talk words in language acquisition, the project should yield outcomes that are relevant to parents as well as practitioners in early childhood development, including nursery caretakers, health visitors and speech and language therapists. As evident from a quick search on the internet, printed media and books written for parents, there is a significant amount of interest outside academia regarding the potential impact of the use of baby-talk words on children's language development. In comparison to other aspects of infant- and child-directed speech, however, the role of baby-talk words is less well understood in research. This has led non-experts and even some practitioners to make unsubstantiated claims about the potential impact of baby-talk words, including the belief that using words such as 'choo-choo' and 'tummy' in place of the adult equivalents 'train' and 'stomach' slows down language development. Our research should clarify some of such potential misunderstandings, and provide the wider public with more scientifically sound information about how children's linguistic development can or may not be influenced by the use of register-specific lexical items.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356984</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Edinburgh Festival event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA88DE47-C0FD-4162-BE8E-661E666B2F48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A public talk event as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, organised by Summerhall.

According to Altmetric, one of our papers reporting the key findings from the project (&amp;quot;Reduplicated words are easier to learn&amp;quot;, Language Learning &amp;amp; Development, vol, 12, 2016) has been featured in 22 stories in 19 news outlets, including CNN news, Parent Herald, Science Daily and Medical News Today, reaching a wide range of audience.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>61C3A8E5-749C-41EE-A86A-D8C2D81353AC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546221bfc74af3.56142201</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The purpose of this project was to address the following questions about so-called baby-talk words, i.e., the set of words that are specifically used for infants, such as 'choo-choo' and 'tummy': Why do many languages have baby-talk words? Why do these words have similar sound patterns across languages, in particular, repetitions (e.g., 'choo-choo', 'night-night') and recurrent ending patterns (e.g., -ie/y, as in 'mummy', 'doggy,' and 'tummy')? Is it simply because, as is often assumed, words of these shapes are easier for immature speakers to pronounce? Or is it because, as we hypothesised, infants find it easier to learn such words even when they do not produce them?
In support of this hypothesis, we discovered the following:

1. Our analysis of baby-talk words across typological different languages showed that baby-talk words (e.g., 'bunny', 'choo-choo') do not necessarily contain sound patterns that are biomechanically easier to produce than their adult counterparts (e.g., 'rabbit', 'train'). In other words, ease for pronunciation is not the sole functional motivation behind baby-talk words.
2. When we tested 9- and 18-month-olds on their ability to pick up new words from running speech and to learn new words as labels for unfamiliar objects, we found that they perform these tasks better when the words contained repeated syllables (e.g., 'neenee', 'foofoo') than when they did not (e.g., 'neefoo', 'foonee'). The sound repetition found in many baby-talk words is likely to be a reflection of these learning biases.
3. Preliminary analysis of our longitudinal naturalistic speech corpus showed that the size of vocabulary at 21 months can be predicted by the proportion of words with repeated sounds and disyllabic words ending in -ie/y. at 9 months Our interpretation is that 9-month-olds who hear many such words get a slight head start in vocabulary learning because these words are easier to process and serve as entry points to further lexical learning.

In addition to these findings, our research project has produced a corpus of naturalistic speech spoken to and by English-learning infants at age 9, 15 and 21 months. With 47 infants recorded at 3 developmental points, this will be one of the largest single cross-sectional/longitudinal corpora documenting what language infants receive and what language they are capable for producing before the age of 2 years. We believe the corpus will be an extremely useful resource for any future research on infants' linguistic environment and linguistic development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are several academic routes by which our findings can be taken forward. 

1. Language acquisition researchers can explore the scope and range of the kind of bootstrapping in language development played by baby-talk words. 
2. This project did not fully explore the potential role of speech production; that is, infants' knowledge of their articulatory capacities may have influenced their detection and learning of novel words in our experiments. This is a question that can be explored by experts on infant speech production.
3. There are some implications for research on the connection between language acquisition and language typology. Sound repetition, which our research indicates to be favoured in learning, is often _avoided_ in the vocabulary of many languages. This suggests that human language typology is not always consistent with ease of acquisition and, therefore by implication, not necessarily a product of language learning constraints.
4. For language evolution, our findings suggest that language has evolved a sub-system that only serves to aid the process of language acquisition (e.g., baby-talk words) but otherwise makes no contribution to the main system (e.g., adult vocabulary).

One of the most obvious non-academic impact our findings have is to dispel the notion frequently found in the media and child-rearing literature that the use of baby-talk words hampers language development. We hope dissemination of our work through the health and education sectors will help to correct this misinformation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E2839FB6-2476-4879-95CF-4DAADCB59C38</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462217e22b561.60200314</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A longitudinal corpus of spontaneous speech involving 47 infants in the Edinburgh area and their caregivers.
