Though often seen in purely nutritional terms - in both archaeology and contemporary policy making - food is central to the production of identity, particularly in contexts of migration and culture contact, and is thus an important but overlooked element in the study of the Viking Age. Understanding of this period is fundamental to the study of later and contemporary culture; it was the social, economic, political, and religious crucible of English and wider European society. We need to understand:
1. The role of material culture in cuisine. Is it possible to associate for the first time particular vessel forms with particular functions or foodstuffs?
2. The degree to which culinary practice was subject to change and innovation, was there variability in time and space, and can this be identified at individual sites?
3. The impact of migration, urbanisation and commercial expansion on local cuisines. Were the cuisines consumed in the cosmopolitan entrep&amp;ocirc;ts of York and Ipswich significantly different to those experienced in contemporary rural sites?
4. The relationship between food and local politics: may distinctive cuisines be identified in politically disparate areas such as the 'Danelaw' settlement of northern and eastern England, or the southern areas of England governed by Anglo-Saxon Wessex, or the Scandinavian 'homelands' of Denmark?

Using cutting-edge scientific techniques to identify manufacturing techniques, wear analysis to characterise mode of use, and analysis of lipid residues to establish vessel contents, we will strategically record, sample, and analyse a large quantity of pottery from well-stratified sites across the British Isles and Scandinavia. Our work will be organised into four work packages. Each WP will asses variation in different traits, informed by evidence from environmental archaeology and documentary history, and supported by a successful pilot study.

Work package 1 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics of diverse ware and vessel form, with various characteristics of use-wear and damage. This will tell us if particular forms of vessel were being used selectively in order to store, transport, process, present, or consume particular foodstuffs, and thus what role was played by material culture in the making of cuisines (Obj 1).

Work package 2 will consider intra-site variation, through controlled comparison between sherds from multiple contexts separated in time and space. This will tell us the degree to which culinary practice was subject to change and innovation at any given site (Obj 2).

Work package 3 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics from sites of diverse character. This will tell us if the cuisines consumed in the cosmopolitan entrep&amp;ocirc;ts of York and Ipswich were significantly different to those experienced in contemporary rural sites (Obj 3).

Work package 4 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics from sites in the Danelaw, southern England and southern Scandinavia. This will tell us whether distinctive cuisines can be identified in politically disparate areas (Obj 4).
 
Our results will be disseminated via open access journal articles, conference presentations, museum display materials, a website with blog, associated social media, and downloadable resources and events for the public and interest groups (Scouts, Girlguides and Young Archaeologists' Club). The project will benefit the scholarly study of the Viking Age, and of food studies more generally. Its application in events and resources for children and local communities will aid the effort to improve understanding of the complex expression of identity in today's world of global mobility and culture contact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Pottery is one of the most ubiquitous finds from archaeological excavations around the globe; a material culture that archaeologists and historians have long since recognised for its importance: 'In their many manifestations, pots resonate throughout human history, from the most primitive domestic meal or drink to the Last Supper; from a nomadic snack to an international banquet.' ('Neil McGregor. BBC Radio 4/British Museum 'The World in 100 Objects'). Yet, unless spectacular, these pots rarely sit centre-stage in museum exhibits; the poor relations of precious metals and accoutrements of war. 

This project will focus on providing benefit to museums and their younger visitors, to demonstrate how the arts and humanities can provide a human dimension for science, and bring alive artefacts sometimes seen only as a &amp;quot;bloodless collection[s] of bowls&amp;quot; (The Guardian. 4.3.2014 in its review of the British Museum's Vikings: Life and Legend). By engaging children and wider audiences in interesting, fun and creative ways, the project aims to demonstrate the connections that exist between food and identity, and show how the humble pot can illustrate the way in which people and places can be shaped by the food they consume. In particular, as Vikings are part of the Key Stage 2 curriculum, we will focus our engagement with young people in the 7-11 age group, where our interactions will enhance and complement what they learn at school. 

Two museums have been identified: The Jorvik Viking Centre (York) and The Collection (Lincoln), both of which are within the research network of the Department of Archaeology at York. Jorvik has a specific focus on the Vikings, whilst The Collection has an excellent archive built up from excavations in the town and it surroundings, though its Viking displays could be enhanced through this project. In archaeological circles, Lincoln is well known as a Scandinavian town, though this heritage is less familiar to the public, and it rarely features in popular narratives of the Viking Age. The two museums thus offer different challenges and potentials for impact. Both are popular family destinations.

Young beneficiaries will also include the Scout and Girlguiding movements, where there is the opportunity to take engagement activities into different settings, and in particular engage through outdoor activities. Additionally, we will engage with the Young Archaeologists' Club (with whom the Department of Archaeology has a close working relationship). As the members already have an interest in archaeology, we will particularly focus on enhancing their understanding of how using a combination of different methods can help with archaeological interpretation. 

The wider public will also be encouraged to interact with the project through online resources.

These groups will benefit through:
-An increased understanding of the archaeological connections between food and identity (and how this resonates today).
-Increased understanding of how different research areas interact to lead to these understandings.
-Enhanced museum exhibits (potentially leading to more visitors).
-Museum staff being better trained to communicate the latest archaeological thinking and scientific techniques.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197524</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>3D scan of a Viking-Age pottery sherd, to demonstrate patterning in external sooting and internal carbonisation.

We talked at length about the project, the techniques involved, the importance of interdisciplinarity, and the impact the science and the humanities can have on understanding how to live in the contemporary world. Average time spent at the stall was c.20 minutes, though some members of the public stayed for over an hour. Comments were left on a 'Thoughts Wall', and on postcards dropped into a Viking pot. This feedback demonstrated that young children, teenagers, and adults all learned something important about the Viking Age, food, culture contact, and about how archaeology works. A number of contacts were made for future talks and workshops, and we distributed a large number of leaflets.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a2f1295ac8f2.82319339</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.jorvik-viking-festival.co.uk/event/meet-the-experts-food-and-identity-in-the-age-of-the-vikings/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exploring the Viking-Age Melting Pot: Food and Identity in Scandinavian England (seminar)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA16BAAC-14F2-4C2C-BA42-4104F3170163</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lecture followed by discussion to c.20 students and staff from the Centre for Scandinavian Studies and Dept of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen.
