It is important to reach beyond local cultural gestures and look towards a more liberating sense of the civic, institutional, and national; but at the same time to infuse the national culture with elements of local experiment and integrity. This dual move is crucial to the long-term health of a community, and understanding the past is part of it. With this principle in mind, the 'Creative Communities' project seeks to advance our understanding of the relationship between creativity and community by focusing on key historical case studies. It will examine how connections between members of a community, and between different communities, can enhance creativity. At the same time, it will subject those key terms to rigorous historical investigation. The three workshops will explore the legacies and current implications of the idea of a creative community. Between 1750 and 1830 there was a flowering of cultural institutions in the form of museums, galleries, dissenting academies, periodicals, theatres, and scientific organisations, the precursors of many of today's cultural institutions. Recent scholarly work has begun to question the individualistic approach to cultural production by considering how social structures and relationships have encouraged creativity. This project seeks to develop this area of research by placing community at the heart of considerations of creativity in both theoretical and practical ways.

The exchange and development of creative ideas amongst thinkers, artists, and entrepreneurs has been at the heart of flourishing cultures for centuries, and this project recognises that model. The proposed network, centred on the Leeds Creativity Project in collaboration with the University of Southampton and University College London, will bring together established and early career researchers, as well as non-academic stakeholders, from a range of institutions, to ask and debate a number of key questions about the relationship between creativity and community. How can a 'creative economy' enhance communal well-being? What is the balance of local and national in a successful creative community? How did communities of the past creatively interact? Above all, what lessons may be learned from understanding these past examples? What kinds of creative generosity can grow from this communal emphasis?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project engages with a range of non-academic stakeholders through an open-access website, an exhibition, and invitations to carefully selected participants from outside academia. Individuals who have already agreed to take part include Kathy Lazenbatt (Royal Asiatic Society), Sarah Lewin (Hampshire Archives), Christine Riding (The National Maritime Museum), and the Reverend Roy Yates (Thoresby Society). Contacts have been established with the Archivist and the Research Curator at the National Gallery, who have expressed an interest in the project, depending of course on the success of this application. The first workshop will be held at the University of Leeds and the Mill Hill Chapel in Leeds, where Joseph Priestley was minister between 1767 and 1773. It will involve the active participation of the Priestley Society (which includes academic and non-academic members) and the Thoresby Society (the longstanding Leeds local history society). The second workshop at the University of Southampton and Chawton House Library will involve contributions from local archivists and a public exhibition of relevant literary works that will focus particularly on women writers from the period (Chawton has significant holdings in this area). The third workshop held in association with UCL will include participants from major cultural institutions including the National Maritime Museum and the Royal Asiatic Society. Should the network secure funding, we will be in a position to seek further targeted engagement with relevant cultural institutions, embracing galleries (the Tate Gallery, the Royal Academy, and Leeds Art Gallery), museums (the British Museum, National Museums Liverpool, Gilbert White's House, and Leeds City Museum), libraries (the Leeds Library), societies (the Hazlitt Society, and the Hampshire Field Club &amp;amp; Archaeological Society) and current periodicals (London Review of Books and the London Magazine). 

The workshop discussions will be made available as podcasts on an open-access website that will be carefully designed for usability. The website will be actively promoted not only to academics, but to such organisations as those listed above.
 
The network will develop connections between academics and cultural institutions designed to last beyond its initial time-frame. Given its exploratory and innovative nature, it is impossible to predict the forms that these connections might take. However, the project will draw upon the combined knowledge, practices, and histories of institutions in understanding how creativity can best be supported by funding and organisational structures. Through the involvement of non-academic members, and the promotion of its activities to non-academic users, the network will impact on individuals and institutions involved in the funding and organisation of cultural institutions and creative communities. This, in turn, should benefit members of the public who are the audience for, and participants in, these communities. A significant public benefit of this network might well be a contribution to the better targeting of funding in the creative arts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Wordsworth Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>Work with the Wordsworth Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>DAB4F4C2-6C0F-45ED-BD87-CC761A6D209C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- A talk by David Higgins on John Clare, and his general participation in a public two-day event at the Wordsworth Trust in Grasmere called 'Seeing into the Life of Things: A Weekend Celebration of Contemporary and Classic Nature Writing'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dea9e7c3e119.93851670-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>So far the contributions have been mainly around meetings to discuss possible outcomes and providing a venue and audience for research talks.

At this stage, it's too early to note impacts. The workshop has been made available as podcasts via the website and is being publicised to potential users.

As a result of post-seminar discussions, a funding application was submitted to the White Rose consortium for a network of research studentships.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544a610c31ab85.13346835</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Two-Day Workshop on Regional and National Networks (Chawton, Hampshire)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D63E0D6C-BB8E-4415-B6E9-BE1ACFAE3EDE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around twenty delegates attended this event at Chawton House Library. Its main aim was to examine the role of regional communities in fostering creativity in the period. In addition to University researchers, there were delegates from regional cultural institution such as the Wordsworth Trust, the Norwich Museum and Art Gallery, and the Hampshire Archives. A combination of papers and seminars sparked a great deal of valuable discussion, which is available on the website as podcasts. Particularly productive was the focus on theoretical models and methodologies for analysing creative communities.

Specific impacts are limited as the aim of the workshop was principally discussion that would build to a more substantial funded project. However, it is worth noting that the event performed an important role in the ongoing collaboration between the University of Leeds and the Wordsworth Trust that has led to several events and a collaboratively supervised doctoral student funded by the AHRC.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543bb2cc6511b3.45080153</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://creativecommunities17501830.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Two-day workshop on Dissenters and Evangelicals (Leeds)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EB426F4-5D90-415A-950C-7898F2DC5FA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A range of academic (approx 20) and non-academic (approx 20) delegates attended this event, which comprised a day workshop at the University of Leeds and a day conference at the Leeds Library.

Podcasts of the event are available on the Creative Communities website, which is being promoted to potential users.

As the first workshop meeting, the emphasis was on planning for the future rather than specific impacts. However, the Leeds Library reported that the event brought new people into the institution.
