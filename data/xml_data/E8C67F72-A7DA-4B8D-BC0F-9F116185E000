Promoting Post-Disaster Rescue Excavations, Salvage and Subsurface Heritage Protection Protocols in Kathmandu</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P006256/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The earthquakes which struck Nepal in 2015 caused a human catastrophe. Not only did they inflict loss of life and livelihoods, they destroyed substantial parts of Kathmandu's unique UNESCO World Heritage site. The monuments of the city were not only ornate structures but were living monuments playing central roles in the daily lives of thousands of Nepalis. Furthermore, their rehabilitation is of economic importance as they represent a major source of foreign currency and employment through tourism. Indeed, the Government of Nepal's 'Cultural Heritage Post-Disaster Needs Assessment 2015' (PDNA) estimates that losses relating to damage and livelihoods amount to over US$23 million. 

Whilst there is a strong political, social and economic desire to reconstruct rapidly, it is critical that post-disaster rescue archaeology is combined with reconstruction. Indeed, plans to reconstruct temples on existing ruined platforms must first be preceded by a phase of rescue excavations to evaluate the subsurface stability of foundations with detailed recording and scientific analysis as few architectural studies have considered them. These will provide a greater understanding of how monuments developed and facilitate their enhanced rehabilitation and future protection. There is also an imperative for information and data sharing and capacity building as damage has already been inflicted on monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage site during the post-disaster pre-reconstruction phase led by architects and engineers unaware of the heritage beneath their feet.

Indeed, having discussed challenges and opportunities with stakeholders in Kathmandu, it is clear that the current focus on the rehabilitation of architectural superstructures has resulted in additional damage to Kathmandu's World Heritage site. This has largely gone unnoticed as it entailed damage to subsurface archaeological heritage, even though this heritage is protected by national legislation. Emergency interventions badly damaged some buildings but, whilst they were driven by recovering the injured and dead, more recent damage relates to non-emergency activities, including engineering contractors cutting exploratory trenches and drilling soil cores, workmen cutting foundations, soldiers deliberately collapsing monuments and engineers dismantling others. All of these events had a common absence of in-situ archaeological recording and the absence of consultation with trained professional archaeologists beforehand.

This absence is paralleled in the PDNA 2015, which fails to note the risk to the vulnerable subsurface archaeological heritage from rehabilitation and reconstruction activities. More recent documents, such as the draft 'Conservation Guidelines for Post 2015 Earthquake Rehabilitation: Conservation Guidelines' (CGPERCG2015) recognise this risk but need strengthening. It is worth noting that this situation is common across South Asia and there is a capacity deficit in urban and rescue archaeology, despite being located in a region whose built heritage is prone to risks from both seismic events and rapid urbanisation. 

Following requests from the Government of Nepal and ICOMOS (Nepal) and responding to AHRC's FoF 'Notice for International Development', our aim is to build on the success of the 'Outstanding' graded AHRC-funded research in Sri Lanka to conduct a practical field training workshop with non-academic collaborators to focus on learning from the evaluation of the foundations of the collapsed Kasthamandap in Kathmandu and as well as on salvaging material to assist post-earthquake plans for its reconstruction and to offer an exemplar for strengthening and disseminating post-disaster subsurface heritage protocols within post-earthquake Kathmandu.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Following requests from the Government of Nepal and ICOMOS (Nepal) and responding to AHRC's FoF 'Notice for International Development', our aim is to build on the success of 'Outstanding' graded AHRC-funded research in Sri Lanka to conduct a Practical Field Training Workshop with non-academic collaborators to focus on the evaluation of the foundations of the collapsed Kasthamandap in Kathmandu and as well as on salvaging material to assist post-earthquake plans for its reconstruction. We will deliver impact by disseminating it as an exemplar for strengthening and disseminating post-disaster subsurface heritage protection protocols within post-earthquake Kathmandu. 

Our first impact activity involves assembling a post-disaster team of 30 Nepali archaeologists, architects, engineers, Sanskritists, soil scientists, civil servants, heritage and disaster managers for a 14-day Kathmandu-based Practical Field Training Workshop in the ruins of the collapsed Kasthamandap to establish methodologies for the recording and evaluation of collapsed heritage sites and the salvaging of materials within post-disaster urban contexts and to assist post-earthquake reconstruction plans in December 2016. This activity will accompany a rescue excavation led by the Government of Nepal's Department of Archaeology and represents the first time that such a diverse group from NGO and GO have been trained together, allowing those from different disciplines to learn about each others approaches as well as collectively recognise the risk to Kathmandu's subsurface heritage during reconstruction. 

Our second focus is on disseminating the information and recommendations arising from the Practical Field Training Workshop, as well as those from the earlier October 2015 UNESCO Post-Disaster mission, more broadly within Kathmandu. As we have limited participant numbers on our Kathmandu Practical Field Training Workshop based on ratios to trainers, we will raise broader awareness of post-disaster monument evaluation, salvaging methodologies and post-disaster subsurface heritage protection protocols through a Kathmandu-focused Dissemination Workshop and Exhibition. The Workshop will be held over two days in a hotel hall with a capacity of 300 individuals and invitations sent out to relevant GOs, NGOs, INGOs and IGOs. The Exhibition will be hosted at the Kasthamandap at the same time as a method of focusing attention on its reconstruction as well as further engaging with residents and stakeholder groups.

The third element of this Kathmandu-focused dissemination is the publication of an illustrated article in the popular Kathmandu art, architecture and interior magazine Spaces, which is read by many engineers and architects. We have previously published with this colour magazine (www.spacesnepal.com) and have an invitation for additional contributions. We will also publish four post-disaster protocol and practice papers in a special number of Ancient Nepal, the journal of the Government of Nepal's Department of Archaeology. Again, this is printed in Nepal and only costs 50 Nepali Rupees (&amp;pound;0.31) and is widely read by historians and architects.

The fourth strand of impact will be the broader dissemination protocols and methdologies to other dense urban post-disaster contexts as subsurface cultural heritage is frequently overlooked. This will include a paper in the Journal of Cultural Heritage Management but will be mainly through digital outputs, including a webinar and associated Field Laboratory Handbook, webpages, exhibition and online gallery. These outputs will be sustained beyond the lifetime of the project by being hosted on Durham's UNESCO Chair website and the broader protocols will be disseminated amongst the members of the UNESCO Chair &amp;amp; UNITWIN Culture Network which was initiated in December 2015 and of which Coningham is a member as well as to ICOMOS by Weise, who is President of ICOMOS (Nepal).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74716</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Sri Lanka</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sri Lanka, Democratic Socialist Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Post-Disaster Rescue Archaeology Training</gtr:description><gtr:id>7D152140-F362-4CBB-AC78-FEB62D68C813</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training delivered.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588f6bfe59a5a1.04856409-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Central Cultural Fund, Government of Sri Lanka, deputed four experienced Archaeological Officers to join our post-disaster team allowing us to expand the remit of the funded program.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We trained four Archaeological Officers from the Central Cultural Fund, Government of Sri Lanka, in post-disaster rescue archaeology.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Archaeology, National Museum and Library</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Myanmar, Union of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Department of Archaeology and National Museum, Government of Myanmar</gtr:description><gtr:id>B87DE3B9-21B1-4CE8-B21D-CBE697D12925</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On-going</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b67995503155.05411831-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Department of Archaeology and National Museum, Government of Myanmar, deputed two experienced Archaeological Officers to join our post-disaster team allowing us to expand the remit of the funded program.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We trained two officers from the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, Government of Myanmar in post-disaster rescue excavation in Kathmandu.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Nepal</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Nepal, State of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Ministry of Education</gtr:department><gtr:description>Department of Archaeology, Government of Nepal</gtr:description><gtr:id>67CF5C8B-70FC-45DB-AB06-B1035664D4BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On-going</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b67aa1739057.72751944-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners provided access, and logistic and professional support in the field.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We co-directed and co-produced the season of post-disaster rescue excavations in Kathmandu.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community and Stakeholder Debriefing Meeting in Nasal Chowk, Hanuman Dhoka, Kathmandu, Nepal</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>974BA3FB-B98E-4A35-B93C-FF305C5CD2BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Community and Stakeholder Debriefing Meeting in Nasal Chowk in Hanuman Dhoka (Kathmandu, Nepal) was held on the 18/11/2016 in order to report back progress omn the agreed program of activities.

These include the halting of the rebuilding of the Kasthamandap by the Kathmandu Municipality with new intrusive foundations and the agreement by the Chinese Government to deploy DoA archaeologists to cut and record exploratory trenches as part of the Basantapur Palace rehabilitation rather than engineers (Kunwar and Gyawali 2016). 
 
Our findings have also allowed the continued co-production in designing rescue excavation methodologies and protocols for post-disaster responses to damaged and destroyed heritage. This included the training of Sri Lankan officers from the Central Cultural Fund, Myanmar officers from the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, Lumbini Buddhist University Students and DoA officers in rescue excavation at the Kasthamandap, alongside on-site interactions with architects and engineers during all stages of the excavation process. This facilitated cross-disciplinary interactions to provide further insight into the potential avenues of reconstruction and rehabilitation of monuments post-earthquake, as well as further understandings of past traditional construction techniques. It also aided the evaluation of the nature and condition of the foundations of the collapsed Kasthamandap to assist the preparation of plans for its reconstruction. Our report and recommendations (Coningham et al. 2016) have been submitted to the expert panel charged with its reconstruction and we have made a number of recommendations which advocate that the foundation walls of the Kasthamandap should be retained as far as possible, utilising traditional techniques, including reused brick and mud mortar, due to the strength and resilience of the existing foundations. 

We also used our findings to provide training to first-responders in a 'live exercise' at a monument at Pashupati. Deliberately collapsed in the aftermath of the 2015 Earthquake to avoid injury during aftershocks, the Guruju Sattal provided a safe area and a spread of rubble over a monument's foundations to train first-responders in how to manage a heritage site in the emergency phase of a disaster, and included participants from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army as well as heritage professionals from the DoA, and Officers from the site manager, Pashupati Area Development Trust. Our recommendations from this process have also been forwarded to the Pashupati Area Development Trust for inclusion within the development of their second master plan for this UNESCO World Heritage Site within the Kathmandu Valley.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A1144A81-116F-4D2C-AA8A-ABA35FD0CEB2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b68c6e502bd0.15431314</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our pilot UNESCO Mission in 2015 identified that the foundations of the Kasthamandap dated to c.700 CE and exhibited no indications of seismic damage from the 2015 or prior earthquakes. During this fieldwork, we also noted that the northeast saddlestone, which would have held one of the four monumental timbers supporting the superstructure, was missing. Seemingly located below a modern conserved tiled surface, the AHRC-funded season allowed us to investigate whether the northeast saddlestone had been removed in the past, or was located below the floor surface. The removal of the tile revealed the saddlestone below. On the surface of the saddlestone we identified a copper plate, utilised as a damp coursing and within the socket we recovered the corroded remains of a copper shoe around a fragment of degraded timber. The presence of the copper shoe, with wood tenon preserved inside, suggests that the pillar's tenon had already severely deteriorated and that individual tiles had been pushed under it during its 1960s restoration rather than dismantling the entire monument. A program of dating the timber superstructure of the monument, including the large timbers and the material within the copper shoe, combined with OSL dating of soil sediments, will now provide evidence for the cyclical renewal of the monument, providing evidence for how monuments, such as the Kasthamandap, in the Kathmandu Valley have been repaired, renewed and renovated since their initial constructions, possibly in relation to earthquake damage. 

Our excavations have also revealed the presence of a symbolic layout to the structure of the foundations. This included a nine-cell mandala created through the use of cross-walls, which were one brick thick, running from the interior of the main foundations, towards the four freestanding brick piers which held the four central saddlestones. Whilst the northeast saddlestone and the nine-celled mandala were identified, it was still important to ascertain whether the northeast saddlestone rested on an intact brick pier. Deep excavations revealed that the brick pier was not damaged or distorted by seismic damage. Furthermore, we identified further cross-walls at a lower depth. This discovery demonstrated that within the central cell, below the sanctum of the Kasthamandap, was a further nine-celled mandala. In combination with the larger mandala and the discovery of gold foil mandalas within each of the sockets of the large four central saddelstones, this allow us to assume that the Kasthamandap was not only built with seismic resilience in mind, but also cosmological and symbolic value from its creation and during renovations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The reports and recommendations from the Project have been submitted to the Department of Archaeology, Government of Nepal (DoA) for their information and action.

The reports and recommendations are also being taken forward by the expert panel tasked with the reconstruction of the Kasthamandap and they have already rejected a potentially highly damaging placing of new intrusive foundations for the reconstruction. We have also offered post-disaster rescue clearing training to members of the Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force in order to better react to such events in the furture.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>80D44265-1F83-43D8-8ADB-23F4961133A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bc2d81b26278.65631314</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/cech/unescochair/research/kathmandu/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Co-production of archaeology strand within the new Master Plan for the Pashupati Area Development Trust, one of the Kathmandu Valley's UNESCO World Heritage Sites</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC013494-8F7D-4DDD-B98F-90605E69CBB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cultural heritage is threatened by increasing pilgrim numbers at major religious sites around the world, particularly in South Asia. Pashupatikshetra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site within the Kathmandu Valley (Nepal), offers a microcosm of the impacts facing archaeology from these global developments and can provide a case-study of balancing heritage management and sustainable pilgrimage. Located on the southern outskirts of the historic city of Deopatan, Pashupatikshetra comprises a monumental core of temples, ashrams and funerary ghats covering 83 hectares along the Bagmati River (Michaels and Tandon 1994: 180). One of the most sacred Hindu temples in Nepal and Kathmandu's premier cremation location, inscriptions indicate that the site was already a place of significance in the Licchavi period. A major Saivite pilgrimage site in South Asia, Pashupatikshetra receives approximately six million pilgrims annually. 

While significant conservation interventions and research have been focused on its monuments, which mainly date to the eighteenth century, they represent just a fraction of Pashupatikshetra's heritage and history as the majority rest buried beneath the contemporary townscape. We have demonstrated that the future survival of Pashupatikshetra's subsurface heritage rests in the careful balance between the needs of infrastructure development for pilgrims, tourists and residents with the preservation of its heritage. Central to our advocacy for preservation is the development of a strategy to characterise and map Pashupatikshetra's subsurface archaeology in order to guide the future infrastructure developments necessary for improving the life of its residents and delivering sustainable pilgrimage. We have stressed that this risk-mapping process need to be research-driven with archaeological and epigraphic evidence utilised to answer questions about the date and character of the earliest phases of the site, the development of patronage and the social, economic and administrative roles of Pashupatikshetra from its earliest occupation through to the present.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b676dc2c3fb0.84015319</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Located south of the historic city of Deopatan, Pashupati comprises a monumental core of temples, ashrams and funerary ghats covering 83 hectares along the Bagmati River (Michaels and Tandon 1994: 180). As the most sacred Hindu temple in Nepal, Kathmandu's premier cremation location and a major Saivite site in South Asia, Pashupati receives approximately six million pilgrims annually. Challenged by the careful balance between the needs of infrastructure development for pilgrims and tourists and the preservation of heritage, Pashupati also suffered damage to heritage during the 2015 Gorkha earthquakes and, as such, a programme of conservation, renovation and post-disaster rehabilitation was initiated at the site. 

A human catastrophe that devastated lives and livelihoods across Nepal, the Gorkha earthquakes also caused a cultural catastrophe, damaging and destroying monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Pashupati. Whilst the majority of monuments within the main temple complex were not catastrophically damaged when compared with sites across the Kathmandu Valley UNESCO World Heritage Property, several structures within the temple complex sustained significant damage. One of these structures was the Guruju Sattal, a three-storied rest house, located adjacent to the western entrance of the main temple complex. Badly damaged in the initial earthquake, the monument was subsequently 
deliberately demolished to avoid loss of life caused by falling masonry in later aftershocks. 

The spread of rubble over and around the Guruju Sattal's foundations also provided an excellent opportunity for capacity building and the training of first-responders in methodologies and protocols for the protection of heritage and recovery of historic materials during post-disaster scenarios. We therefore undertook a 'live exercise' between the 2nd and 20th December 2016, whereby first-responders to a disaster, including personnel from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army as well as heritage professionals from the Department of Archaeology, Government of Nepal, and Officers from the site manager, Pashupati Area Development Trust, were provided with training on the collapsed building. The Guruju Sattal's ruins and debris allowed us to replicate a collapsed monument, similar to those encountered in the immediate post-earthquake phase. A year after the 2015 earthquakes, this live exercise also offered the opportunity of capacity building in a safe training environment, giving first-responders the necessary skills and knowledge of post-disaster archaeological methods and protocols to enable the protection of heritage alongside rapid response during search and rescue efforts focused on the injured, trapped or dead.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA8D1408-0320-47A0-BD9D-EAE4EB631DBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Having uncovered evidence of earlier phases of monuments and settlements, which would have been lost without rescue excavations in advance of reconstruction, we also recognise that the events of 2015 illustrate the need for capacity building and training. Although rigorous archaeological rescue excavations are now being conducted in the non-emergency phase, there remains a gap in capacity for the protection of heritage in the aftermath of an earthquake. In the immediate aftermath of the Gorkha earthquake it was observed that materials from several monuments were mixed during clearing, including the removal of modern and archaeological material together. This was then removed en masse, with historic material from Hanuman Dhoka's Durbar Square removed by army trucks and dumped unsorted). Whilst humanitarian efforts are of paramount importance, this is a critical phase for the protection of heritage. Therefore, it is imperative that there is training for first-responders in methodologies for the protection of heritage and recovery of historic materials during post-disaster scenarios. There is also an economic aspect to this as newly made brick for heritage construction are currently in short supply and cost an estimated &amp;pound;1.31 each - a huge figure considering the hundreds of thousands of bricks just dumped during UNDP-sponsored clearing. 

During December 2016, a 'live' training exercise' was implemented at Pashupati Temple complex to provide a field laboratory in post-disaster heritage methodologies and approaches to damaged cultural heritage sites. Whilst the majority of monuments at Pashupati were unharmed, some sustained damage. This included the Guruju Sattal, a three-storied rest house, located adjacent to the western entrance of the main Temple complex, which was badly damaged during the earthquake and the unstable structure was deliberately demolished. The spread of rubble over the Guruju Sattal's foundations provided an opportunity to train first-responders in how to manage a heritage site in the emergency phase of a disaster, and included participants from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army as well as heritage professionals from the DoA, and Officers from the site manager, Pashupati Area Development Trust.

The Guruju Sattal's ruins and debris allowed us to replicate a collapsed monument, similar to those encountered in a post-earthquake phase in a safe training environment. It offered first-responders skills and knowledge of post-disaster archaeological methods and protocols to enable the protection of heritage alongside rapid response during search and rescue efforts. As there was a lack of capacity in the recording, recovery and sorting of archaeological material during the emergency response phase, especially amongst first-responders, who were present on the scene post-disaster and encountered archaeological materials during this very difficult and stressful phase of humanitarian recovery, we aimed to develop a simple methodology that had three key requirements:

1) A method that could be quickly implemented at, and transferred to, any collapsed monument;
2) A rapid methodology which would not impede the recovery of trapped or injured people within a collapsed monument;
3) A method that could be implemented by non-heritage experts without specialist equipment.

Guruju Sattal provided an ideal monument around which to co-produce a methodology and protocols in a non-threatening environment with individuals and groups of first-responders. The following methodology was developed during the live exercise.

As speed is of the essence, the size of the rubble spread from a collapsed monument should be quickly assessed, with this area then gridded into squares. The rationale behind the grid is that any rubble removed can be provenanced to a particular locality within the site. The grid therefore allows for the quick removal of material with a fairly robust known spatial location. A replicated grid is created near the site, mirroring the layout of the trench grid, with rubble moved into the corresponding grid square. This replicated grid can be constructed from bamboo or metal scaffold, or outlined with lime depending on availability of materials in the immediate post-disaster period. In later processing, this means that artefacts, including structural elements, can be spatially reconstructed in the hope that salvaged material could possibly be reused in reconstruction and conservation. 

Before the clearance of debris, a quick photograph is taken using a mobile phone, which is likely to be at hand to many first-responders, especially military and police personnel. To provide a quick scale, any equipment to hand to remove the rubble in post-disaster recovery and clearance efforts, such as a shovel, can be utilised. Rubble is then removed within each square onto the surviving in-situ archaeology below, such as floors or stable old land surfaces, which is also where the injured, trapped and dead would be located. To speed up the removal of rubble, material can be shovelled into sacks. These sacks can then be labelled with a unique identifying number, linked to each grid-square and then deposited in the replicated grid square to be processed during the non-emergency phase. Furthermore, portable antiquities and fragments of sculpture were also given unique special find numbers and removed to a safe locked store nearby. Furthermore, brick and tile, that was not broken or damaged can be stacked by each replicated square so that these can be reused in reconstruction. 

By salvaging bricks, the cost of producing new brick for reconstructions could be reduced, saving money during the very costly reconstruction phase. The PDNA anticipated these &amp;quot;bottlenecks in the supply of timber and special bricks used for restoration&amp;quot; (PDNA 2015: 4) after huge amounts of material was removed from historic sites and dumped in various localities around the Valley following clearance of collapsed monuments. It is also suggested that after this emergency phase, the surviving standing architecture of a monument can be assessed, as can its foundations and earlier cultural sequences, in a research orientated environment prior to reconstruction, as illustrated by our work at Kasthamandap and other monuments across the Kathmandu Valley. During the live exercise at Guruju Sattal, the photographs and records were uploaded to a private Facebook group. This could be accessed by all members to upload their data but also allowed them to see records and photographs uploaded by other members. Furthermore, the group allowed for discussions and communication during the live exercise. We are aware that internet connections might fail during a disaster, as in the days after the earthquake of 25th April 2015, and we are currently developing an off-line app that can be used on a mobile phone for the uploading of data during excavation and the post-disaster emergency response.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6786f71b1a4.47422752</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Post-Disaster Rescue Archaeology Toolkits</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006256/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A30C52-7659-4E94-B5E2-F9BB53767467</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeological Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
