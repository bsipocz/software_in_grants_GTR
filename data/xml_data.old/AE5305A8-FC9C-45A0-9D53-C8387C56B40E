This will map out current activities across domains (e.g. investment, reward-driven, philanthropy), economic scale, geographic location and economic 'reach' etc. to create a clear picture of the heterogeneity of the developing online crowdfunding sector in the UK. It will do this through a systematic search and review of existing crowdfunding platforms and related literature from across academic publications, crowdfunding practitioner reports, policy, reports produced by the charitable economic innovation and development sectors (e.g. NESTA) and business reports. A 'taxonomy of crowdfunding' will be developed which identifies and defines domains of activity against, for example, funders' motivations, to develop an understanding of the success factors in bringing projects to fruition. Following this, qualitative analyses will explore communicative exchanges within the social networks that are generated on crowdfunding platforms around particular projects, among and between project 'founders' and project 'funders'. Preliminary empirical research on Kickstarter by Briggs (2013), and analyses elsewhere of the 'success signals' of funded projects on this platform (Mollick, 2013) suggest that communication and building of a sense of community by project founders, with and among funders plays an important role in project success. In this context success is measured as a project idea presented on the site attracting enough backers to reach its stated funding goal and go forward to realisation. Building on this, and drawing from media and visual communications theories around mediated forms of representation, and marketing theories on trust signaling and commercial value networks, the research will examine if and in what ways trust is built by project founders within project networks and any potential impact on funders' behaviour, including buying and investment decisions. The proposed research will also explore the potential affective role of audio visual media, particularly in relation to empathy; and examine if and how founders signal 'pitch trustworthiness' in promoting their projects to potential funders using mediated forms e.g. video.

The research will focus on UK-based platforms, and to a lesser extent international sites that enable use by UK-based founders. The proposed research aims to develop greater understanding around the potential of the crowdfunding model: from economic, social and cultural perspectives, while identifying its limitations and specific pitfalls for particular sectors and domains.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Producing a clear picture of current crowdfunding in the UK and mapping its characteristics with regard to domains of activity and geographic and economic scope, while also eliciting insights into the potential of 'ERT' in leveraging project success (or otherwise), will have potential benefit for public, private and third sector organisations and individuals.

The public sector include: Government departments BIS and DFID; MPs, including the Westminster Crowdfunding Forum; and the Northern Ireland Executive and DETI. The Digital Economy has generated a host of as yet unregulated but rapidly growing novel investment opportunities through various micro-finance models which are still establishing: the research potentially impacts other related bodies such as financial and internet regulators FSA and OFCOM. The work also potentially has value for policymakers working in economic policy.

The research will impact on a wide range of academic disciplines but particularly those involving research into new business models and ways in which services and products are marketed, financed, produced and distributed. 

The project will establish and develop a new research team across a Newcastle-upon-Tyne-Northern Ireland or 'NCL-NI' corridor, and further develop and train-up researchers. 

The research potentially has value by contributing to an informed debate on the sustainability of the Cultural Industries. In the regions, this is increasingly a political issue as London is perceived to be &amp;quot;eating up&amp;quot; limited public cultural funding resources (Powell, Gordon and Stark, 2013). As cultural organisations adopt entrepreneurial and charitable funding models to sustain what was previously publicly-funded, the research will impact across organisations such as Arts Council England, and hundreds of national and regional arts and cultural charities and associated Community Interest Companies. 

Similarly, by generating discussion and raising awareness around micro-funding opportunities, the research will impact charities, non-profit and third sector organisations. 

Another important areas of potential impact includes the financial services sector, businesses and business consultants. And related to this: regional investment organisations e.g. Invest NI; think tanks, and charitable innovation organisations such as NESTA, which has produced reports on crowdfunding and other new alternative financing models. 

The Creative Industries are often discussed (including by the British Government and NI Executive) as a future area of jobs growth. Already prominent on reward-driven crowdfunding sites is a spectrum of creatives (artists, product designers, filmmakers, gaming companies etc.) who adopt this financing model in their attempts to enable economic and cultural sustainability. The research will help to inform project founders in the Creative Industries on approaches to crowdfunding products and servcies. The research potentially impacts on the critical issue of economic sustainability more broadly, on jobs creation and changing patterns of labour. While crowdfunding provides opportunities, it is also associated with trends towards informalisation and 'precarity' of labour. The research then potentially impacts on researchers in media theory and sociology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75576</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Westminster Crowdfunding Forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0EF088F-6817-4613-8897-579744445213</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PI Briggs attended twice, once with co-I Anderson, contributing to the group's understanding around the scope and methodological challenges of of academic research.

Briggs went on to work with one arts organisation to explore whether and how crowdfunding could be approached to help mitigate the recent cuts to its public funding. Briggs organised an intensive 1-day workshop with the arts organisation's three core members and three of its board of directors and a crowdfunding consultant. Following this PI Briggs helped to organisation to write a small grant application to buy in extra help to explore the potential and develop a campaign.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565c7fd033a7e5.25302502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Which City Will Lift the Global Crowdfunding Crown?&quot; seminar and discussion event organised by the Crowdfunding Centre 15.08.15</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCF38E3F-39AE-4E94-9CB1-17284B572FE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contributed to discussion during the afternoon session involving (by Skype) Richard Swart, Director of Research, The Program for Innovation in Entrepreneurial and Social Finance University of California at Berkeley to compare research agendas in the US and UK and to try to develop a strategy for linking up centres of knowledge towards an international perspective.

This was more information and knowledge exchange and helped to strengthen fledgling relationships with industry partitioners; for example, a crowdfunding consultant met at the event has since contributed to a full-day crowdfunding workshop with an arts organisation in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565c7654927720.26138749</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PaCCS and Co-operation Ireland round table and workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F6E542E2-96EB-4940-BA63-7ACB4DE9364B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PI Briggs was invited to present early findings from the research at Durham University with a view to working with the charity Co-operation Ireland to co-develop research and to contribute to it existing LEGaSi programme promoting civic engagement within sociopolitically divided communities in Northern Ireland and specifically to explore how the crowdfunding campaigning process could be utilised within mechanisms to mobilise community and social action locally.

Of three complementary literature reviews that were conducted one necessarily considered the 'grey' (self published and/or non-peer reviewed) literature to reflect the fact that much relevant knowledge is held outside or at the margins of formal academic understanding. The review revealed the predominance of economic and financial conceptual frameworks in describing the importance and impact of crowdfunding activities with a large majority that did not attempt to conceptualise crowdfunding along categorical lines at all. An emphasis on single economic measures of crowdfunding 'success' and 'failure' in the emerging literature drew attention to the fact that other outcomes are potentially being ignored and this informed our mid-term focus. 

To reflect the potential applications of online crowdfunding in the UK we looked at examples of campaigns from across the three broad domains of activity; creative industries; social enterprises; and for-profit. Our qualitative work with research stakeholders involved interviews across the UK and a series of crowdfunding workshop and roundtable events in the North East involving local business and professional bodies, a multitude of smaller voluntary sector and cultural organisations and SMEs. These had the dual aim of generating research insights and also helping organisations explore near-future uses of crowdfunding and identify potential disruptions to business processes and relations. This aligned programme of 'how to' awareness-raising and discussion workshops-and evaluations facilitated through complementary HEIF and ERDF funding-enabled us to apply our emerging insights and feedback to organisations from a practice 'in the wild' perspective, informed by participatory design practices; this novel design-social science approach enabled us to capture the crowdfunding experience much more fully than existing popular taxonomies (e.g. 'donation', 'rewards', 'equity', investment').</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The potential of design in social science: using participatory creative methods to facilitate a social design/ethnographic process to reveal detailed insights into the challenges and opportunities of crowdfunding (and related disintermediated 'peer-to-peer' online financial exchange) from the perspectives of social enterprise organisations that are planning and launching their first campaign, and the potential for disruption to existing organisational practices, memberships/values and wider engagement. And related to this; new ways of practicing, theorising and engaging within social science research through the uses of and effects of new and emerging p2p practices, from the perspective of social enterprise organisations (or indeed, their supporters or the platform infrastructure).

We have only scratched the surface of understanding the role of trust in crowdfunding across the various models of donation, rewards, equity and debt.
