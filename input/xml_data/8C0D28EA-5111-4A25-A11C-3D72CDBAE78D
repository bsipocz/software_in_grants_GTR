Walking with Robots is proving to be an extraordinary success. In its first two years the project has either organised or participated in 160 different events and activities around the UK, reaching an audience of about 60,000. The project is educating and entertaining young children and their families, encouraging teenage children to think about what impact robots might have in their lifetimes and engaging adults in serious debates about the ethical questions raised by intelligent robots in society.I am passionate about science and engineering, and passionate about communicating science and engineering. I believe that there is much more that I can do to explain and interpret advances in the very broad and multidisciplinary field that intelligent robotics now is and, through robotics, convey the excitement and value of research to the public. Furthermore, my broad experience as an electronic engineer, entrepreneur and facilitator of knowledge transfer from research idea to commercial product, means that I can set my public engagement work in the real-world context of economics and wealth creation.I propose a Senior Media Fellowship with a focus on intelligent robots in science and society. A theme that will explore and explain the very rapid advances in intelligent robotics, and the wider implications of those advances to society. I propose a programme of media activities structured around my current research projects, especially EPSRC project 'The Emergence of Artificial Culture in Robot Societies'. Those activities will include a TV documentary telling the story of the artificial culture project as it unfolds. The project will encompass both traditional broadcast TV and online project TV; the latter designed to reach younger audiences and connect those audiences with research in a way that is not possible with traditional broadcast media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>112077</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IoP Physics in Perspective Lecture, Royal Institution, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B6DE49F2-02C2-427A-880D-50C8E37C3BFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk and practical demonstration generated great interest, questions and discussion from the teenage audience members.

1. Policy and standards: 
A major outcome was the drafting and publication of the EPSRC/AHRC principles of robotics. This was disseminated via the press and media (e.g. BBC and New Scientist), and via public lectures and debates, and has achieved significant traction in the robotics community. This led to Winfield's appointment to the British Standards Institute working group on Robot Ethics, and the recent publication - by the working group - of a draft document, for comment, which could become a candidate new standard. Further impact includes (i) Winfield's engagement in the wider European discourse on the Ethical, Legal and Societal impact of robotics, and (ii) Winfield's membership of an expert panel briefing for a G8 committee, on potential risks from robotics and AI.

2. New research directions:
WInfield's work on robot ethics has led to new thinking and research toward ethical robots. This led to new collaborative EPSRC project Verifiable Autonomy (EP/L024861/1), with Fisher (Liverpool, project lead), and Veres (Sheffield), in which Winfield's work will be to research verifiable ethical robots.

3. Open Science. Research on the link between open science and public engagement, focussed on an EPSRC DTA funded PhD programme, has led to publications and wider impact, including for instance Winfield's involvement in the Governance work package of EU FET flagship bid Robot Companions, and an invitation, as speaker on open science, to 2014 H2020 European conference on Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).

4. Public discourse: 
More general impact has been to broad the public discourse on societal and economic impact of Intelligent Robotics through media, including online media. Evidence of this impact includes an invitation to contribute a chapter to NESTA book: Our work here is done - visions of a robot economy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>03BA1AC7-D5D9-4CDD-BED8-E52B2D6678BE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b4c9d2cf499.24842311</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The focus of this Senior Media Fellowship was Intelligent Robots in Science and Society. Its overall aim was to explore and explain the very rapid advances in intelligent robotics, and the wider implications of those advances to society. 

In addition to broad coverage of Intelligent Robotics issues through public lectures and events, online engagement, press and media appearances, and print media, the Fellowship proactively developed two areas: Robot Ethics and Open Science. 

As a result of the Fellowship Alan Winfield was appointed Director of the Science Communication Unit at UWE, Bristol.

In Robot Ethics Alan Winfield co-organised a workshop on Robot Ethics, which brought together senior figures from academia and industry from a wide range of disciplines including engineering, artificial intelligence, law, ethics and the social sciences. The workshop developed and in 2011 published a set of Principles of Robotics. Winfield widely disseminated these Principles both within the robotics community, and to the general public, provoking debate, raising awareness and generating press and media attention.

In Open Science Alan Winfield undertook two threads of activity. One was research to advance understanding of Open Science and its symbiotic role with Public Engagement; this research was undertaken through a successful PhD programme (Ann Grand, PhD). The other was advocacy, in calling for greater transparency in Science Engineering and Technology. Both research and advocacy were underpinned by using online Open Science approaches within Winfield's robotics research. 

Summary of project outputs, including highlights: 
* 35 public lectures and debates including: 3 lectures at the Royal Institution, 1 TEDx talk, 2 IET public lectures, and appearances at the Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science Festivals and the HowTheLightGetsIn Festival;

* 60 online articles (blog posts) with ~120,000 page views; the blog was ranked in the top ten computer science blogs in 2012;
* 9 print publications, including one book: Robotics: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2012;
* 1 PhD completion.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This Senior Media Fellowship was not primarily a research project.
