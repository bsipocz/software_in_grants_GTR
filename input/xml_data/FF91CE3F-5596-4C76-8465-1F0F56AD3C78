Some tendons are more likely to be injured than others, e.g. the human Achilles is highly prone to injury. This is partly due to its function. While most tendons are involved in limb placement for movement, some, including the Achilles have another function; they act as a spring, stretching to store energy then recoiling to return it, decreasing the body's energy consumption. To achieve this, they have a specialist structure. All tendons are composed of collagen molecules, grouped together to form larger subunits, the largest of which is the fascicle. Fascicles are bound together by inter-fascicular matrix (IFM), but we have evidence that this matrix has a unique and important mechanism in energy storing tendons and is responsible for allowing these tendons to act as springs. This has exciting implications; some individuals are able to use their tendons heavily without injury occurring whilst others are very prone to injury. We believe this may occur as a result of variations in the IFM, reducing the tendon capacity to extend and recoil. If we can quantify IFM structure and function and relate this to tendon properties, we may be able to predict the likelihood of injury in specific tendons, and develop methods to increase resistance to tendon injury and prevent disability.

Racehorses also suffer from tendon injuries. These are one of the most common reasons horses used for athletic purposes are retired and is a cause for considerable economic loss. The energy storing superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) in horses is functionally equivalent to the human Achilles and is injured the most often. The characteristics of tendon injury are similar between horses and humans, so we can use the horse as a model to better understand the role of the IFM in human tendon injury. In horse tendon, our previous work shows that the SDFT has a less stiff IFM than the non-energy storing common digital extensor tendon (CDET), which enables the SDFT to extend further before failure. We also have evidence that SDFT fascicles have a better recoil mechanism, indicating that lower IFM stiffness is critical for increasing damage resistance and protecting tendons from injury. Further, we have evidence that the IFM becomes stiffer with age, which may explain why tendon injuries increase in older people and animals. We intend to compare the structure and mechanics of the IFM in different tendons and different aged horses to see if we can identify the specific molecules that are key in influencing IFM mechanical properties. 

We will determine how the composition of the IFM influences its mechanical properties in both the SDFT and CDET. Firstly, we will look at the different proteins in the IFM, and establish how they are organised. We will then measure IFM stiffness and determine how this is influenced by different IFM components. Once we have identified structural differences in the IFM between tendon types, we will focus on the damage resistant SDFT for the rest of the project. We will perform several mechanical tests on the SDFT, which will allow us to establish which IFM components control the ability of the tendon to extend and recoil, and provide damage resistance. We will also identify any age related changes in IFM composition and structure, and link these with ageing changes in mechanical properties. 

In this work, we will focus on horse tendon. However, our findings will be applicable to humans and other species. The outcomes of this work will be the identification of components that are important in preventing tendon injury. The resulting data will allow us to understand the role of the IFM in normal tendon function, and how this changes with age and injury. This work will help researchers to develop treatments targeted at the IFM, and even improve training plans to promote appropriate IFM development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We have preliminary evidence that the interfascicular matrix (IFM) is a key determinant of tendon failure properties and fatigue resistance. We hypothesise that injury prone energy storing tendons have an extensible IFM with minimal hysteresis, leading to a structure with improved fatigue resistance. Poor optimisation of the IFM or structural changes with age may predispose individuals to tendinopathy.

This project aims to investigate the role of the IFM in modulating fatigue resistance. Using an equine model, we will compare IFM composition and mechanics between a high strain energy storing and a low strain positional tendon, correlating these data with the mechanical characteristics of the tendons. Looking specifically at the energy storing tendon, we will then establish how the IFM changes with ageing and how this influences fatigue resistance. Finally, we will use knockout models and enzymatic techniques to manipulate IFM composition, and establish how this influences our findings.

The equine model proves an ideal energy storing tendon, with similar properties to the human Achilles. It is also large enough to be used for a series of experiments, enabling paired statistical analyses of the influence of IFM organisation and age on tendon function. IFM composition will be assessed using histology, immunohistochemistry, mass spectroscopy and qPCR. IFM, fascicle and tendon mechanical properties will be determined using quasi-static and cyclic fatigue tests to failure. 

Data will provide greater understanding of how injury and ageing influence tendon mechanics via the IFM and may provide insights into methods of limiting injury risk. This will inform treatment practices, and facilitate the design of targeted drugs or treatments for the IFM. It may also be possible to develop training protocols to encourage appropriate IFM development, with the long term goals of decreasing the incidence of tendon injury and improving recovery rate post-injury.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Tendon disorders are highly debilitating and painful, and musculoskeletal injuries lead to more days off work than any other illness, costing the economy over &amp;pound;7 billion a year (1). Tendon injury is also common in horses (2) and with a total economic impact of over &amp;pound;3 billion a year from horse racing (3), preventing tendon injuries is high priority (4). A key outcome from our grant is improved understanding of tendon fatigue resistance which is fundamental to preventing damage. We anticipate considerable long term societal benefits to patients with tendon injuries, both preventing new cases and improving healing. This will improve quality of life, reduce strain on the NHS, and lower costs associated with time off work. Such findings are also directly relevant to horses. Around 16,000 race horses are in training each year (3), and tendon injury rate is as high as 43% with very few horses returning to racing post injury; preventing these injuries is essential for the economic health of the industry and to improve equine welfare (5). To realise these potential impact opportunities, we will target our research towards clinical colleagues and medical or healthcare companies.

This project will benefit academics and clinicians with an interest in tendon (dys)function. In the short term, our understanding of how tendons respond to load may clarify optimal methods for treating tendon injury. There is no current consensus on tendon treatment, and no clear physiotherapy regime to promote healing. The PI works closely with a clinical physiotherapist specialising in tendon disorders, and the pair have developed techniques for investigating in vivo tendon biomechanics. We anticipate using these systems to translate our in vitro findings to an in vivo setting and determine optimal physiotherapy training mechanisms for tendon repair. We also have a veterinary surgeon and academic within the current investigative team, enabling us to translate our research across veterinary boundies. Discussions with these healthcare partners will not only provide valuable feedback on the clinical relevance of our data, but also allow us to consider the optimal methods of disseminating our findings in a manner accessible to healthcare professionals.

Towards the end of the grant we will focus on R&amp;amp;D investment. In characterising the key matrix components that protect tendon from damage, this work will be of interest to companies keen to develop products to prevent or treat tendon injury. There is also strong potential for collaboration with biomaterials and tissue engineering companies. The composite structure of tendon appears key to its optimal function and fatigue resistance. Characterising this will enable us to identify the specific material requirements that must be recapitulated in artificial tendons, significantly improving our potential for developing functional repairs. With skills in biomaterials amongst the applicants, we would remain closely involved in the development of repair solutions. The team has experience of working with medical device companies focused on tissue implant products (e.g. Tissue Science Laboratories; now Coviden), enabling us to advance research towards biomaterial tendon repairs. We also predict tissue engineering benefits, specifically relating to the biological and mechanical environment surrounding cells in the non-collagenous tendon matrix. We anticipate that our data will highlight how cell environment differs in healthy and damaged tendon, providing insights into the optimal in vitro environment for promoting tendon repair. As an additional area of expertise within the research team, we would aim to develop links with tissue engineering companies to take this forward.

In the first paper, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, we have used proteomics to comprehensively analyse the composition of, and repair processes in, tendons of different ages. We have shown that in young individuals, tendon cells are able to respond to tendon injury and attempt to repair the damage. With increasing age, this ability to repair damage decreases, and we see multiple protein fragments in old tendons which are not present in young tendons, suggesting that damage may be accumulating in the tissue over time. We have explored this further in our most recent study, published in Scientific Reports, in which we used laser capture microdissection to isolate the two different regions of tendon, the fascicles and the interfascicular matrix. We used proteomics to provide the first comprehensive characterisation of the protein profile of the fascicles and interfascicular matrix and identify changes with ageing. The results from this study demonstrate a distinct protein profile between the fascicles and interfascicular matrix, and indicate that proteins within the interfascicular matrix are renewed more rapidly than those in the fascicles. However, the rate of protein renewal decreases with ageing in the interfascicular matrix specifically. This likely results in a reduced ability to repair damage to this region and therefore contributes to the increased risk of injury with ageing. We have also examined the distribution of specific proteins within fascicles and the interfascicular matrix further using histology and immunohistochemistry; and our data, which have been accepted for publication in the Journal of Anatomy, demonstrate localisation of lubricin and elastin to the interfascicular matrix. Identifying the proteins present in the different tendon compartments provides an understanding of how differences in composition give rise to the distinct mechanical properties exhibited by the interfascicular matrix and fascicles. This novel information also provides an important first step towards understanding how our tissues break down as we age, which will help guide the development of treatments to stop tissue breakdown occurring, and encourage increased cell repair activity in old tendons.
We have also investigated the immediate response to tendon injury, in order to try and understand the process more fully, and have published this work in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports. We took pieces of tendon and subjected to them to high loads, before staining the tissue, to investigate how the tendon was damaged and to look for inflammation. We found that damaged tendon had higher levels of various markers of inflammation, as well as increased levels of tissue breakdown, all indicating an early inflammatory response from the tendon cells, leading to injury. This new understanding is particularly important, as it is contrary to previous theories which suggested a lack of inflammation in tendon injury, and may thus require scientists to reconsider treatment options. It may be possible to treat tendon more effectively if we target the inflammatory period in the future. 
We are also undertaking a body of work to characterise the mechanical properties of fascicles and the interfascicular matrix. . In one study (published in the Journal of the Mechanical Behaviour of Biomedical Materials), we investigated how the tendon interfascicular matrix responds to cyclic loading. We have discovered that the interfascicular matrix is able to resist and recover from cyclic loading, something that has not been demonstrated before. Further, we have shown that the interfascicular matrix is more elastic in energy storing tendons than in positional tendons, and that elasticity decreases with ageing in energy storing tendons specifically. We have recently performed experiments to assess the fatigue response of fascicles and the interfascicular matrix, demonstrating that the interfascicular matrix shows greater fatigue resistance in energy storing tendons. The resulting manuscript will be submitted to Acta Biomaterialia. These data highlight the important role of the interfascicular matrix in facilitating the high strain characteristics and fatigue resistance of energy storing tendon, and provide important information allowing us to further understand structure-function relationships and ageing mechanisms in tendon. We have developed techniques to allow failure and fatigue testing of tendons. We have designed and manufactured cryogrips and an environmental chamber, which will allow us to grip samples and maintain sample hydration. The data from these experiments will allow us to compare tendon, fascicle and interfascicular matrix fatigue properties, and determine the origins of the superior fatigue properties seen in energy storing tendons.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A greater understanding of the response of tendon cells to injury, and how this is altered with ageing, will be of interest to medical and veterinary clinicians as these findings will help guide the development of treatments and preventative measures for tendon injury. Our findings will also be of benefit to researchers with an interest in soft tissue structure-function relationships. Indeed, we are collaborating with researchers at Manchester University, Vienna University of Technology and AGH University of Science and Technology, Poland; providing data generated from our experiments to allow them to develop and validate their computational models of tendon mechanics. Further, our findings are also of importance to tissue engineering and biomaterials focussed academics, as improved understanding of tissue function is key to developing appropriate artificial repairs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>764CFC43-3699-44CD-915B-706501BCE326</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c98d84a4c8.11681065</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.tendon.qmul.ac.uk/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Proteomics data generated has been uploaded to the ProteomeXchange data repository.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AC13192E-CBD3-4D8C-89EE-D0699641AF13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none known at present</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6eac71f1b90.62512226</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Proteomics data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002979</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>246076BA-8179-4049-B31C-AAE79C1757AE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fascicles and the interfascicular matrix show adaptation for fatigue resistance in energy storing tendons.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta biomaterialia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9"><gtr:id>2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thorpe CT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-7061</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b451b07b6650.26114830</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4C06650E-931D-4CFB-875E-B05EFC41DC60</gtr:id><gtr:title>Distribution of proteins within different compartments of tendon varies according to tendon type.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of anatomy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9"><gtr:id>2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thorpe CT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-8782</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d6f21e0639f2.05061650</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9269DF52-D12D-49A8-88AE-0EC71D18E00B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The interfascicular matrix enables fascicle sliding and recovery in tendon, and behaves more elastically in energy storing tendons.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9"><gtr:id>2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thorpe CT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1878-0180</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d6f0576f2120.04097066</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B24EBB2-2929-4582-BED9-0BBFC672D8B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proteomic analysis reveals age-related changes in tendon matrix composition, with age- and injury-specific matrix fragmentation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e7871485a9b5d3206aedbde1d263bb27"><gtr:id>e7871485a9b5d3206aedbde1d263bb27</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peffers MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d6f0b78c79f7.11638777</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD938701-8270-4972-9179-0C1D979762F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Anatomical heterogeneity of tendon: Fascicular and interfascicular tendon compartments have distinct proteomic composition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9"><gtr:id>2ab28337acea59b0233a99aaeaa5e6b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thorpe CT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d6f19c996a19.10336578</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CBD1C95B-5377-4B24-94D4-9124A924127D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tendon overload results in alterations in cell shape and increased markers of inflammation and matrix degradation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scandinavian journal of medicine &amp;
