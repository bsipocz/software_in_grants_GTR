The development of nuclear power is at an important juncture, with two competing but in many ways complementary technologies: fusion and fission. However, while the nuclear methodology is different the engineering challenge is the same, that is, the need to remove the generated heat while structures are subject to high levels of radiation damage and residual nuclear products. In particular, radiation damage effects and gas bubble formation are problematic issues for the development of both fusion and GenIV fission reactors. For example in a GenIV fission core, the Xe and Kr gas comes from fission of the fissile nuclei, that is, Pu and U, while in a fusion core He is formed within the D-T plasma. This proposal aims to address these issues using tunable perovskites, as model materials, and focusing on the following issues:

1. Crystalline to amorphous transformation mechanisms in tunable ceramics instigated using non-radioactive ion beams.
2. Bubble nucleation at micro-structural traps in predominantly fission reactor materials, e.g. oxide based fuels, and ODS materials, but which can be formed by He implantation from fusion plasma He nucleation, and damage in materials for use in fusion cores, such as YBCO superconductors suggested as magnetic containment in for example, ITER and DEMO.

The research will be undertaken using the approach of experimental and simulation techniques combined holistically. The experimental study will utilise in-situ and bulk irradiation, primarily in combination with advanced electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. The complementary simulation programme will be based on irradiated materials, but focusing on recovery mechanisms, bubble evolution, and validation of current models. 

The outcomes of the research will be used in the development of new materials for use as both fuels, for example Inert Matrix, or as magnetic containment devices in ITER/DEMO. The information from this research can also be utilised in other non-standard reactor technologies such as the travelling wave designs.

The information derived will also help the design of future waste forms for Pu/U, specifically into new phases capable of tolerating the effects of radiation damage, and He bubble formation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>960558</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Dr. Edmondson relocation</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3DE9CFF-172B-4E7F-AEA6-34A30E6503FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e285c20a116.17362836-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>n/a</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Dr Philip Edmondson has taken up a staff position at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

The aim of the course is to give brief insight into this unique subject, and to break down those conventional physics, chemistry, maths subject separations.
 
Lectures include topics such as molecular modelling, photovoltaic cells and materials for nuclear fusion, then move onto a more practical element in the afternoons, where students get to experience making your own solar cells and running mechanical property tests - sometimes with open ended investigation. There is also a tutorial session in groups of 3 to give students the full &amp;quot;Oxford experience&amp;quot;, giving you them the chance to converse with experts in their field. A few tips on interviews can be picked up during the mock interview session later in the week.

UNIQ is a free summer school. Most of the students that were selected to attend the school meet one or both conditions of being from a disadvantaged socio-economic background and/or from a neighbourhood with low participation in higher education.

Methods for atomic-scale visualisation based on high resolution electron microscopy and atom probe tomography have been developed. 
In the case of atom probe tomography, the yield of successful experiments was very low, and so new specimen preparation methodologies were developed. 
Furthermore, the experimental parameters were found to have significant effect on the final measurements. The work undertaken in this project sheds new light on how the way the experiment is applied is affecting the results, and enables optimisation of the analysis and ultimately shows that these materials can be characterised at the nanoscale with a high degree of confidence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has made significant inroads into the characterisation of these materials.
Rigorous experimental methodologies have been developed and presented, along with further understanding to interpret the results. 
The project has put these methodolgies in place such that other researchers can now implement these approaches directly.
Further, development will enable analysis of peroskite materials for a broad range of applications.
In particular it will underpin atomic scale investigation of radiation damage in these materials and their applicability as a waste-form for active nuclear materials.
This is of interest to those working in the Energy and Defence sectors in the UK, where there is an increasing emphasis on nuclear energy and the safe and responsible management of waste.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0AB411C4-B80C-44A6-B167-7F4E18E860C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9268450007.34196019</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Dr. Danaie has led efforts to successfully apply for access time to a new JEOL 200-ARM instrument based at Oxford, which is part of a multi-institution facility.
