However, whilst revolutionary technologies have enabled the sequencing of thousands of complete genomes, it is more challenging to determine the 3D structures of the proteins. Although the sequence repositories now contain &amp;gt;10 million protein sequences, less than 70,000 protein structures have been determined. Fortunately, in parallel with developments in sequencing technologies, powerful computational methods have emerged to predict the structure of a protein from its sequence. Currently these methods provide putative structures for ~80% of domain sequences from completed genomes, although the accuracy of this data varies from reasonably precise when structures are modelled using templates based on close relatives, through to quite approximate for models based on remote relatives and where proteins have no structurally characterised relatives. This project will bring together 6 internationally renowned UK groups involved in (1) classifying protein domains into evolutionary families (as this facilitates structure and function prediction) and/or (2) protein structure prediction. As regards the first activity - classification of protein structures - the two groups involved (SCOP,CATH) are the only groups, worldwide, providing this data. However, each applies somewhat different methodologies to make their assignments. Collaboration between these groups, in GENOME-3D, will involve comparison of domain structures and family classifications leading to refinements of assignments and/or confidence levels where the methods disagree. Since manual curation of the data is essential and since the rate at which the structures are determined is increasing, collaborations will speed up classification by allowing the groups to share information on the more challenging assignments and to discuss outcomes. For the second activity, structure prediction, the groups involved use technologies that vary in their sensitivity and in their ability to handle large numbers of sequences. Whilst SUPERFAMILY (based on SCOP) and Gene3D (based on CATH) provide greater coverage they are less likely to recognise very remote homologues, where methods such as GenTHREADER, Phyre, Fugue perform better. For each sequence, we will combine predictions from these different resources and assign confidence for each residue position in a query sequence based on the number of methods that agree in their structural prediction. We will provide pre-calculated assignments and also allow dynamic queries on the methods. We will also build 3D models for the sequences with residue positions highlighted according to agreement between the methods. We will develop computational platforms that integrate the information provided by each resource. To distribute this data to the biological and medical community we will build a dedicated web site. We will also establish web servers that link the methods ie run all the methods on query sequences and then report consensus assignments and highlight differences. In addition the consensus classification and annotation data will also be provided via two major international sites - the PDBe and InterPro. The sequence repositories are expanding at phenomenal rates as metagenomics and next gen sequencing initiatives bring in sequences from diverse microbial environments and report sequence variants occurring across different human populations or associated with different disease phenotypes. Structural data will enhance the insights available from this data. For example, known or predicted structures can reveal whether residue mutations occur near sites important for protein function or interaction with other proteins in complexes and signalling pathways. Collaborations within GENOME-3D will lead to more accurate and more comprehensive structural data for use by these initiatives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will develop the GENOME-3D: (1) website - presenting integrated information from the consortiums resources (2) webserver - allowing users to submit query sequences/structures to run against the consortiums methods and return consensus predictions. (1) GENOME-3D website We will develop SOAP/REST based web services for: - Exporting data from individual resources to GENOME-3D ie domain boundaries/superfamily classifications/domain structure predictions - Combining data, identifying consensus regions and calculating confidence values We will develop Taverna workflows which plug together the above web-services to provide consensus data. We will build a web portal to display this data (see figure 1 main text). The website will exploit an Oracle database and will provide facilities for querying with protein structure ids (PDB ids) or sequence ids (UniProt or GI codes). All partners have extensive experience in web design. CATH-Gene3D has tools for visualising multiple structure/multiple sequence alignments and highlighting conserved residues on representative structures. These will be adopted by GENOME-3D. We will design a questionnaire to capture feedback on the site and use this to improve design. (1) GENOME-3D webserver As well as providing predetermined classifications/annotations via the website (some data is manually curated), we will establish a server that allows structure/sequence based queries and automatically returns consensus domain classifications/predictions (no manual curation). We will develop SOAP/REST based web services for: - Scanning query structures against classification methods ie structure comparison (CATHEDRAL) and homologue recognition (HMMscan) to give uncurated SCOP/CATH assignments. - Performing multiple structure alignments - Scanning query sequences against individual methods predicting domain structures and structural features eg membrane regions - Generating consensus data from multiple prediction methods</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>SUMMARY OF RESOURCE This proposal is to establish a resource (GENOME-3D) for the bioscience and biomedical communities providing integrated information on the 3D structures of proteins and relate this data to protein function. GENOME-3D will comprise information from major UK groups in structural bioinformatics. The individual resources are extensively used by the community - combined access to the different databases is &amp;gt;50,000 visits per month and the total number of jobs run on all the servers is 20,000 jobs per month. This testifies to the importance of this structure and functional information for both the academic and commercial communities. Producing a combined resource will enhance the value of the individual components by enabling comparisons and cross-referencing. The resource will have an impact on many applications of bioscience and biomedical research. This proposal is endorsed by letters of support from several major UK pharmaceutical, biotech and agricultural companies - Syngenta, UCB, GSK, Isogenica, Heptares, Syntaxin and Astex. SCIENCE COMMUNITY Food security - Increasingly the sequences of plants, agricultural pests and agents of disease will be the focus of genome sequencing and structural studies. GENOME-3D will assist in the interpretation of the relationship between sequence variations between plant strains and help identify the best strain to meet yield, water requirements, colour, taste and resistance to pests and disease. The information could benefit chemical discovery and marker identification for crop breeding programs. Bio-energy and bio-industry - The manipulation of individual molecules and pathways will yield new sources of energy and materials. Synthetic pathways can be engineered to make molecules, such as fuels, more efficiently. In addition, novel molecules can be designed and synthesised. Detailed structural knowledge of a protein family can be used to suggest the critical changes to alter function. At the pathway level, GENOME-3D will help to identify the components based on sequence and structural information of families of proteins. Health - The central role of protein structure in the design of novel and improved pharmaceuticals is well established. Provision of the highest quality 3D models from gene sequence will therefore directly enhance the discovery of new hits. The refinement of these hits into leads will benefit from information about a family of molecules to highlight the relationship of stereochemistry, ligand binding and activity. Therapeutic molecules will span the spectrum from low molecular weight compounds, through peptides into proteins, including antibodies. A major development in the next few years will be the sequencing of many individuals and relating their sequence variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) to disease susceptibility. This will provide major insights into biological processes in humans, the development of personalised medicine and the identification of novel drug targets. Central in the interpretation of SNPs effects in protein coding regions will be knowledge in GENOME-3D of the inter-relationships between protein sequence, structure, function and pathways. POLICY MAKERS AND THE LAY PUBLIC GENOME-3D will involve several UK groups working together to develop a world-leading bioinformatics resource. The success of the project could inform policy makers about the value of collaborative work for bioinformatics and other scientific resources within the UK, within Europe and worldwide. Similarly, GENOME-3D can demonstrate to the general public (including schools) the value of bioinformatics resources and collaborative research. GENOME-3D has applied to become a node within the ELIXIR funding framework. Participation in this new mechanism for promoting collaborative development and maintenance of major European resources will help shape policy and provide exemplars of how Elixir can benefit the wider European community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>294318</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL - EBI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>InterPro</gtr:description><gtr:id>BF03F7A0-0BB3-45E3-9A36-347E12490F01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications

CATH-Gene3D provide domain family HMMs and structure annotations to InterPro on a regular basis. We have recently provided a new tool - CATH-Resolve-Hits for generating accurate multi-domain architecture information from sequence matches to the CATH domain HMM libraries.

Collaborations between research groups involved in the Genome3D project has resulted in a high quality mapping between the CATH and SCOP structural classification databases. This is being implemented by the PDBe to improve the clarity and coverage of structural annotations in their resource.

We participated in a Wellcome Trust funded workshop on chronic pain at which we gave a talk and demonstration of how CATH-Gene3D and Genome3D data was being used to provide structural and functional information on genes involved in chronic pain


The schools reported that our talks had generated a lot of interest in proteins and structural biology and that several students had decided to seek further information on undergraduate courses with study modules on computational biology.

Our talks include images of protein structures which help in intuitively conveying information on the mechanisms by which proteins function.

The consensus structural annotation data is being used by PDBe to provide information on protein sequences related to structures deposited in the PDB. The SCOP/CATH mapping is being used by InterPro to guide integration of the structural annotations from SUPERFAMILY and Gene3D in InterPro. 

Genome3D structural annotations of Pfam families are being used by the NIH funded Midwest Centre for Structural Genomics to guide target selection for structure determination. This will significantly aid the structural coverage of sequence space.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2DB8D898-3195-4474-A521-14A72C65F069</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546479e2959cc9.10858779</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Knowing the 3D structure of a protein can be very valuable for understanding the mechanism by which it functions and for designing drugs that could inhibit or modify its function. However, fewer than 10% of known protein sequences have known protein structures. This project provided predictions of protein structures for structurally uncharacterised proteins from ten model organisms including human, fly, mouse and yeast. These predictions were made on the basis of homology to known protein structures. In order to increase confidence in the accuracy of the predictions, information was combined from five independent resources, (SUPERFAMILY, Gene3D, PHYRE, FUGUE, pDomTHREADER) and the groups developing these resources collaborated to provide this data. 

A computational platform was developed for integrating the data from the different resources and a public website was launched one year after the project started. The new Genome3D resource was publicised in the special issue of Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) on databases and presented in a technology track at the ISMB international meeting for computational biology in July 2013. A workshop demonstrating Genome3D was held at UCL in July 2014.

The coverage of sequences with predicted structures has recently been extended to include representatives from all Pfam families. Pfam families account for nearly 80% of known domains in nature. A further publication in NAR reports the structural coverage of Pfam families.

Since the different Genome3D prediction methods use either CATH or SCOP domain families, a mapping between these resources was developed to determine when methods were predicting that proteins adopted structures from equivalent families in SCOP or CATH.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Since fewer than 10% of protein sequences have known structures, Genome3D data is likely to be valuable for a wide range of biologists and structural biologists. For example, the domain structure boundary information will be useful for guiding construct design for protein structure determination. Structural data is also valuable for understanding the mechanisms by which proteins function.

The structural data in Genome3D will be valuable for biologists/biomedical researchers seeking to understand the likely impact of a genetic variation or nsSNP in a query protein.

Genome3D data is also useful for target selection by structural genomics consortia. Since Genome3D provides the most comprehensive structural coverage of Pfam families, it has been used by the NIH PSI structural genomics consortia to target structurally uncharacterised Pfam families.

The structural annotations will also be useful for bioinformaticians and chemical biologists in pharmaceutical companies seeking to determine whether a drug target has structural analogs that could bind the drug, resulting in side effects.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4E91B21A-028B-423C-A9B4-D004B9F4426A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647a737f0b77.99620127</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.genome3d.eu</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Structural Bioinformatics Consortium (ELIXIR)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAA1A6AC-A8A4-408C-A7CB-7BA7153F22B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are part of a consortium of 17 research groups developing training material in structural bioinformatics.

Genome3D provides consensus structural annotations and 3D models for sequences from model organisms, including human. These data are generated by several UK based resources in the Genome3D consortium: SCOP, CATH, SUPERFAMILY, Gene3D, FUGUE, THREADER, PHYRE. In addition Genome3D integrates structural classification data from SCOP and CATH.

An overview of some of the features this resource provides:

Structural Annotations -- regions of protein sequences that have been matched to structural domains (from CATH or SCOP)
Structural Models -- regions of protein sequences that have been modelled in 3D (based on similarity to a CATH or SCOP domain)
Consensus Superfamilies -- an official collaboration between the structural domain classification databases CATH and SCOP.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7BF44882-DC26-4E3B-8A0F-4CEFE4FCB6CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of the Genome3D research involved building strong working collaborations between leading structural bioinformatics groups in the UK.
