In essence, it is capable of reconstructing the electromagnetic parameters (permittivity, permeability and conductivity) of an object from measurements made on its surface. An MIT device consists of two sets of coils placed around the boundary of the object to be imaged. The first set of coils is used for the purpose of excitation, and by passing a current through each coil in turn, a primary magnetic field is created. The second set of coils is then used for measurement. This procedure causes an eddy current when each of the primary magnetic fields interacts with a conducting body inducing secondary magnetic fields, and hence voltages, that are measured in the second set of coils.

Enabling MIT to take the step from being an experimental technique, which has already received some clinical interest, to become a viable imaging technique for the detection and monitoring of conditions, such as cerebral stroke, requires a step change in the quality of the reconstruction of the electromagnetic parameters and, therefore, an improvement of the computational approach used for the solution of the inverse problem. To achieve this we propose to solve the inverse Maxwell problem with a variational algorithm. Although a proof of concept of this work exists, in order to make this algorithm effective in a clinical environment, and hence applicable to the MIT problem, an implementation using high performance computing is needed, this research proposal aims to address this issue.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed work will bring benefits across a broad spectrum of beneficiaries based both in the UK and beyond.

Our work will bring immediate benefits to interdisciplinary international academic researchers in the fields of Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Medical Physics. Specifically, groups with interests in high performance computing, applied linear algebra, optimisation and parallel algorithms will benefit from new technological developments in the form algorithmic developments. Applied mathematicians and engineers working in academia in computational electromagnetism, error estimation and adaptivity as well as inverse problems will also benefit from the technological developments in this proposal in terms of the new computational procedures and implementations that will be developed. In addition, medical physicists working in academia on Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT) devices will also benefit from a new imaging toolkit that will be developed as part of this proposal. 

The work we will undertake will also bring immediate benefits to industry. Specifically, companies developing computational electromagnetics modelling software, medical device modelling software and companies developing imaging software for medical and industrial applications will benefit from the new technological developments in terms of new algorithms and implementations that will be developed as part of this project. Specific examples include improved linear algebra solution techniques on GPU processors and uncertainty quantification through error estimation. It will also bring benefits to companies developing imaging devices for medical and industrial processes, whereby, through the technological developments proposed, improved imaging resolution for MIT and other similar imaging devices will be accomplished. To ensure these benefits are realised, we will organise two one-day dissemination and impact events to disseminate our findings to the participants of the Welsh Electromagnetics Network and other interested groups during the lifecycle of our project.

In the medium term, the project will help to inform members of the public sector such as national heath care decision makers and regional managers for health care providers considering the investment in new medical technologies for improving the quality of patient diagnosis. This will lead to operational changes whereby low cost MIT can be used to supplement existing high cost imaging modalities (MRI, CT) in the initial stages of diagnosis and for patient monitoring.

In the longer term, the project will also benefit the general public by improving the health and well being of the nation through better imaging techniques to assist with medical diagnosis and monitoring of patients.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183786</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>68648</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Case Award Studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>BACA092C-9F4C-4A5C-BC8F-2167290ED1A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5436a1395d7d94.26637493</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The PDRA employed on the project 2013-2015 has gone on to find employment in the private sector after completion of his contract.

1) The development of new iterative reconstruction process for recovering distributions of conductivity, permittivity and permeability from boundary measurements of electromagnetic fields. This new algorithm introduces adaptivity for the representation of the recovery process. This allows the algorithm to achieve higher fidelity reconstructions compared to traditional constant voxel approaches. The approach has been applied to model problems in 2D and the results presented at the BAMC conference in Cardiff in 2014. 

2) The development of a 3D Maxwell eddy current finite element solver based on the deal.II finite element library. This required the implementation of the Zaglmayr-Schoeberl Nedelec basis function set and implementing algorithms to overcome the sign conflict problems associated with edges and faces on general hexahedral meshes. A preconditioner previously developed by Ledger and Zaglmayr was implemented and ensures the rapid convergence of a GMRES solver. The code allows for arbitrary uniform polynomial degree and has been applied to a series of challenging benchmark problems. Our findings have been submitted in the form of a journal article, which is under review. This software has been made available under the GPL open source licence.

3) A 3D inverse solver for Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT), which recovers the conductivity distribution from perturbed voltages, has been developed. Unfortunately, due earlier issues with the deal.II finite element library, which impacted severely on the time remaining for the inverse solver, it is currently limited to recovering a spherical inclusion, but does serve to demonstrate the methodology performs correctly. The software employs the Gauss-Newton algorithm, which solves the MIT forward problem by applying the 3D eddy current solver discussed in (2). This is used to update the conductivity distribution until convergence is obtained. New innovations include the new treatment of the coils avoiding need for their discretisation. We intend to report our findings in a journal article. This software has been made available under the GPL open source license.

4) The further development of a MATLAB based hp-finite element solver for electromagnetism and coupled physics by the wider research group of Dr Ledger. This research has resulted in new methodologies for the solution of coupled electro-mechanical-fluid problems and journal articles in Computers and Structures (3) and Applied Mathematical Modelling (1) have been published as a result. This has influenced and impacted on the development of the 3D eddy current MIT forward and inverse solvers described above.

5) This research project together with other research undertaken by the group of Dr P.D. Ledger has attracted the interest of Siemens and this has lead to further funding in the form of an EPSRC CASE award PhD studentship, which is focused on the simulation magneto-mechanical vibrations in MRI scanners.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have already made efforts to communicate our findings to the wider academic community. Specifically, we have presented the results of our research to the applied mathematics community nationally at the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium, Cardiff University 2014 and internationally at the 
Biennial Numerical Analysis Conference at the University of Strathclyde in 2015. It was also presented at specialist one day inverse problems workshops at The University of Manchester and The University of Leeds in 2014 and Cardiff University in 2015. We have engaged with our project partners, Professor Huw Griffiths and Dr Manuch Solemani, and sought their views on our latest developments. Going forward we envisage writing a paper to promote our inverse results to the wider community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>87866EC7-81F6-4ED5-8F1B-E5537A3294EB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448266fc6df94.82601641</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.swansea.ac.uk/engineering/research/areas/inverse-problems-and-imaging/#d.en.174478</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This code is provided to solve the magnetic induction tomography (MIT) inverse problem where the goal to recover the conductivity of a target object using measurements taken some distance away from the object in the form of voltage differences. This is achieved through a regularised Gauss-Newton iterative scheme. The code is intended as a proof-of-concept and so is limited to the recovery of a spherical inclusion.

The forward solver driving the iterative scheme solves the eddy current approximation of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. This makes use of H(curl)-conforming hp-finite element methods at arbitrary polynomial order, which have been implemented in the deal.II finite element library. A fully benchmarked version of this code can be found at https://github.com/rosskynch/MIT_Forward. Note that there may be some minor alterations between the two forward solvers in these two repositories, but they are largely the same.

The deal.II library, found at http://www.dealii.org is required for this code to run.

Assuming deal.II 8.3 is installed and configured properly, then the code should run successfully. However, we recommend that the deal.II development branch dated July 6th (SHA hash 79583e56) is used to ensure total compatibility.

A library for computing complex bessel functions is also required, see here: https://github.com/valandil/complex_bessel</gtr:description><gtr:id>4BA6F871-3353-4EAD-A636-6FF723F1675C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The code has been provided to our collaborators in Cardiff University who intend to develop a parallel version of the software.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c4a9b463e623.83370544</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>3D MIT inverse solver for sphere benchmark.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/rosskynch/MIT_Inverse</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This software relates to an addition to the deal.II open-source finite element library.
