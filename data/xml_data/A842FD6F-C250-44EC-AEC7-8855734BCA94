&lt;p>What will be explored is the role of prospective and projective thinking in advancing social justice and social cohesion, as well as its potential for impeding such. In particular, research activities will serve to focus attention on the following topics of enquiry:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>cross-cultural understandings of extremism, especially from the perspective of youth culture and with respect to its potential common ground&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the potential loss of faith in humanity occasioned by violent sectarian conflict and forms of post-conflict rehabilitation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the role that popular culture and community arts initiatives are able to play in transforming the disadvantaged sectors of developing societies and new democracies through advancing social and economic inclusiveness. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The programme of research will be carried out through a series of Global Uncertainties events entailing public sector involvement, together with practice-based research in the form of creative projects, fieldwork and the setting up of networks.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. DSTL and the All Parliamentary Group for Global Uncertainties stand to benefit with respect to how the research addresses the ways in which human capabilities and local cultural resources may be drawn on with respect to conflict prevention and post-conflict resolution. Regarding post-conflict resolution, the documentary on rebuilding trust in Beirut will demonstrate how communities confront the question of their own post-conflict rehabilitation (this being of relevance not only to Beirut but across the contemporary MENA region). Regarding conflict prevention, the programme will offer insights into how the popular imagination responds to perceived situations of negligence and to forms of intervention relating to such. The context for this is both the Arab Spring and the London riots.

2. The FCO also stands to benefit from the above, but more particularly with respect to the following strands of the programme. The research into prospective, anticipatory and utopian forms of thinking, while distinct from horizon scanning as a predictive form of thinking, is related to such with respect to understanding popular forms of mobilization and consensual action. The programme, through workshops and related outputs, will also serve to identify the difference between destructive and constructive forms of utopianism, in relation to both extremist formations and activism in the wake of the Arab Spring. Furthermore, the monograph on Mezzaterra literature will serve as a means of disseminating longer term progressive thinking around establishing a cultural common ground in the Middle East and as well as between Britain and the Middle East.

3. The research will benefit organisations that are committed to using culture, especially the arts, as a means of establishing trust and promoting peace. In particular, it will establish partnership possibilities with the British Council and, more widely, it will create a resource base comprised both of expertise on global popular culture and of links with its practitioners, especially in the MENA region and Southern Africa. It will do this through the setting up of the proposed cultural academy for new and fragile democracies. In addition to the British Council, this resource base is of potential use to UNESCO, NGOs (such as International Alert) and charities (such as Firefly International).

4. The research activities will serve to network creative community centres in New Delhi, especially the Sarai Centre, Cape Town and Cairo with respect to knowledge exchange.

5. The research stands to benefit galleries and arts organisations in the UK. It has the potential to build on forms of collaboration or forms of consultancy already established to date (including with Wasafiri, the October gallery, El Sawy Culturewheel, Turner Contemporary) while particular attention will be given to the new affiliation between the PI's department and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Opportunities to connect GU research with the ICA programme will be sought as appropriate.

6. Audiences will be reached through feeding into channels provided by the above the above for talks or performance, and also through film festivals and screenings. The collaboration with director Mai Masri, whose award-winning work has been widely screened at documentary festivals, will serve to identify and provide access to internationally significant platforms. The collaboration with film-maker Albert Chimedza will also provide access to users of the filmed portraits through the EU Ambassador in Zimbabwe. 

6. Special screenings and/ or dvds will be arranged for interested policy makers. Relevant material will be offered to DFID and potentially discussed at a breakfast meeting with particular emphasis on the effective targeting of aid. 

7. The work on trust, on therapeutic communities and on the psychology of poverty stands to be of benefit to mental health professionals: SLP (Lebanon); The Freud Museum (London).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>422713</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Interviews with writers and activists in Cairo 2010</gtr:description><gtr:id>1977551B-D13F-45F5-A4A9-199E66EBD63F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It informs research on how writers anticipated the revolution.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546270762214b9.28124633</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Documentary Short: The Road to Midan Tahrir</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.kent.ac.uk/english/research/commonground/Cairo.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Two poems, 'People like to make films about me' and 'Overture' published in Over Land, Over Sea: Poems For Those Seeking Refuge, edited by Kathleen Bell, Emma Lee and Siobhan Logan (Five Leaves Publishing) and introduced by Sir Martyn Poliakoff.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D7E4042D-B900-4499-8CA7-472A680518D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A series of public readings are underway.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d87ff68e5a34.10029296</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Human Rights Poetry 2</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://fiveleavesbookshop.co.uk/over-land-over-sea/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>My poetry was selected by the University of London Human Rights Consortium to appear in an anthology of human rights poetry with a foreword by Ruth Padel.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5A45C7EE-436D-4227-B63E-6942A57080B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have been invited to give 3 poetry readings on the basis of this publication.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54635af933d565.23570370</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Human Rights Poetry</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This arts documentary, set against the backdrop of the current refugee crisis, engages with generations of Palestinian refugees and exiles who have come to live and work in England.

The documentary explores current issues in Lebanon relating to conflictual post-war memory, ideological and sectarian divisions, socio-economic problems, and peacebuilding initiatives by individuals and organisations who seek to actively intervene in their society and rebuild trust amid the challenges and dangers of ongoing crises. 
It conceptually and artistically explores the importance of white flags in a country where the national flag has oftentimes had its significance stolen and where the variously coloured flags of embattled political parties have heightened tensions and divisions. 
It features interviews with psychoanalyst Chawki Azouri, journalist Jeanine Jalkh, president of 'Memory for the Future' association Amal Makarem, and artists-activists Raouf Rifai and Aurelien Zouki.
It was completed with the participation of cinematographer Johnny Hchaime and the production management team at The Media Trust, London. It was also sub-titled by Rita Sakr. It was funded by Research Councils UK as part of the Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research (formerly Global Uncertainties).</gtr:description><gtr:id>C0E808FD-E871-4F7E-B961-BAA866E1E227</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The documentary will be shown at various venues in the UK, Ireland, Lebanon, Egypt, and possibly other countries.

The play explores how 'since the Israeli occupation in 1967, Palestine has become a nation of prisons. Up to 40% of the male population has been detained under military orders. Virtually every family has seen relatives put behind bars and generations have grown up in the shadow of the cell'. The Keepers of Infinite Space presented to the public, a humane and multi-faceted perspective on one of the most significant on-going humanitarian issues that has been the focus of reports by international legal groups and various NGOs, together with an FCO report.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F541AF2-3B3C-4CE7-A98B-F059BBC063DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Widely reviewed.

Impact events included a Q&amp;amp;A with the creative team and two panel discussions on 'Cultural Resistance' (with contributions from members of the Jenin Freedom Theatre) and 'Prisoners and Human Rights' (with human rights compaigners from MAP and the PSC). 
Both Rooney and Sakr have been engaged in research on prisoners and human rights. Rooney, with filmmaker Mai Masri conducted research on the topic in Palestine, interviewing former child prisoners and the YMCA rehabilitation group. Sakr, who put together an annotated bibliography on the topic, had meetings and conversations with NGOs in Lebanon whose work focuses on the rights and rehabilitation of prisoners including Khiam Rehabilitation Center, ALEF, Zeina Daccache of Catharsis, Human Rights Watch. Al Jazeera reported on the opening of the show on its news channel.

Evidence submitted to the House of Lords Select Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence was accepted and quoted in paragraph 21of the published report as follows:
Professor Caroline Rooney of the University of Kent told us that &amp;quot;the intensification of cynicism towards mainstream politics leads to loss of trust and competing forms of transnationalism&amp;quot;. She described a process akin to a pushing outward, whereby citizens' interests transcended national politics: &amp;quot;international power relations are structured through strata that are transnational as opposed to just national&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the transnational lateral ties are increasingly at least as important as national ones, if not more so&amp;quot;, she told us.55 While the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 and the Occupy network of protests point to the potential for more widespread political participation resulting from this shift, the potential threats of Islamism could be interpreted as part of the same dynamic.56 Professor Rooney told us that &amp;quot;young rappers in Egypt, the UK and America feel they have much more in common with each other in terms of values and outlooks than with the elite bankers of their own nationalities&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;Islamism and Zionism are internationally supported movements in ways that can override national interests&amp;quot;. (pp.31-2)

Rooney contributed an article on 'From Religion and Security to Religion and Liberty' to the policy document Getting Religion: Challenging Religious Literacy in a Time of Global Uncertainty produced by GU Leadership Fellow John Wolfe, and she is also interviewed in this publication. This document was debated in a policy seminar sponsored by John Glenn MP and Dai Harvard MP (2015, Portcullis House). Following a GU APPG meeting, Rooney was invited to forward a summary of her work on counter-narratives to Susannah Browne (Home Office), and the two of them subsequently met to exchange ideas of relevance to the Prevent strategy.

Rooney's work on Palestinian prisoners had as an initial motivation the FCO backed report on child prisoners, where at a Parliamentary meeting it was stated that raising public awareness would be helpful as means of gaining support for prison reforms on the part of the Israeli government. Rooney's play production in collaboration with writer Omar El Khairy and Freedom Theatre director Zoe Lafferty, The Keepers of Infinite Space, draws public attention to issues raised in the report, as well as to further related issues. The play's run at the Park Theatre (22 Jan - 16 Feb) was nearly completely sold out and reviewers commented: 'A play full of pathos, rage and loss; riveting to watch. If you want something both cerebral and dramatic with some polemic thrown in too, go and see it' (Everything Theatre) and 'hard-hitting political theatre at its best. DO NOT MISS' (Theatreworld Internet Magazine). The play achieved several 4-5 star ratings, and there were three platform debates on the play's concerns with full house audiences. Al Jazeera ran a feature on the play as a news item (as opposed to arts one) in that it humanises a predicament usually presented in abstract terms, this constituting soft power impact. Students from Kings College set up an online blog about the play, and other online blogs about it appeared. The grant programme's workshop on Hamlet and extremism (based on a Counterpunch article by Rooney) explored Islamic extremism in relation to European far right extremism. Avaes Mohammed attended this workshop and subsequently wrote two plays on its central area of exploration: 'Hurling Rubble at the Moon' and 'Hurling Rubble at the Sun', staged as a double bill at the Park Theatre (2015).

Due to her work on The Keepers of Infinite Space, William Parry approached Rooney to co-direct an advocacy film on Palestinian prisoners and medical rights, entitled 'Breaking the Generations: Palestinian Prisoners and Medical Rights'. The film includes interviews with NGO leaders and doctors including: Ruchama Morton (Physicians for Human Rights), Gerald Horton (Military Court Watch), Sahar Francis (Adameer), Hani Abdeen (Al Quds Medical School), and Mahmud Sehwail and Khader Rasras (Torture and Rehabilitation Centre), as well as interviews with prisoners and their families. The film was initially screened in late 2015 and early 2016 to an APPG for Palestine meeting at Holyrood, at a Manchester University workshop and at an Imagining the Common Ground sandpit meeting on the Israel-Palestine conflict. While these audiences are well-informed about the conflict, they have said that the film has offered them new information and new perspectives. In early 2016, it was screened at a Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights convention, and adopted as a LPHR campaign tool to inform lawyers and activists. It was also screened at the Toronto Palestine Film Festival 2016, while Medical Aid for Palestinians set up a campaign feature around a You-Tube link to the film. In the first few days of the campaign, there were over 600 viewings leading to approximately 100 letters being sent to MPs. The advocacy film thus provides public support for initiatives by British MPs to institute reforms pertaining to the rights of Palestinian prisoners, especially with respect to child prisoners and the medical rights of all Palestinian prisoners, including the cessation of torture.

Following a meeting with Israeli journalist Amira Hass, Rooney set up a sandpit meeting with Israeli, Palestinian and British experts on the conflict. The meeting served to identify the current absence of any peace process, as reported to the APPG for Palestine at Westminster. Rooney then arranged a talk by Israeli journalist Gideon Levy at the All Party Parliamentary Group for Palestine to address the concerns of the sandpit regarding the impasse of the stalled peace process. This was followed up by her collaboration with the NGO One Democratic State to mount a public debate with Gideon Levy and Ilan Pappe on the future prospects of peace initiatives, attended by approximately 200 people with 7,711 viewings of the screening of the debate posted on You-Tube. It has raised awareness of current obstacles to peace and of potential ways forward. On the strength of her contribution to a Cambridge Debating Union debate on solutions to the Israel-Palestine conflict, Rooney was invited to take part in a LSE Grimshaw Club debate on this topic and did so, and was further invited to contribute to a similar Cardiff debate. Her expertise in this area of pressing political significance is thus registered. 

Rooney's programme has also engaged with raising public awareness around refugees seeking asylum in Britain to counter racism based on ignorance. With Bahriye Kemal and Kent Refugee Help, she staged a performance event at the Canterbury Festival (2014) which featured readings by refugee writers and a performance of a play by Avaes Mohammed on homeless immigrants. Members of KRH explained their work to the public audience of about 100 attracting new members and financial support. Following on from this, Kemal and Rooney have been developing a website on the literary trails of migrants and refugees from the Eastern Mediterranean and Levant. Rooney's film England Times Palestine, made in collaboration with Palestinian director Mai Masri, concerns Palestinian refugees and migrants based in England, and is due to be screened at international festivals later in the year. It entails collaboration with Oxford Maqam musicians towards a specially produced new rendition of traditional Palestinian music. Rooney has also contributed to poetry anthologies on human rights and refugees as part of their arts activist platforms towards counter-narratives, including public readings. In addition, Rooney took part in an in conversation with the Independent's foreign correspondent Patrick Cockburn on the rise of ISIL at the Wise Words festival in Canterbury, the two of them responding to the audience's requests for explanations and clarifications.

Given that Islamic extremism and Islamic authoritarianism dominate the media, Rooney's film White Flags, made in collaboration with Lebanese cinematographer Johnny Hchaime and with Lebanese Research Associate Rita Sakr, provides an important counter-balance in that it shows how Lebanese citizens engage in post-conflict trust-building and how they advance their own counter-narratives in combatting extremism. The film was also made to provide inspiration for other post-conflict societies. It has been screened to large audiences at prime venues for promoting critical and intellectual debate, including the ICA (Being Human Festival), the London Freud Museum, Mansion Blatt Gallery (Beirut) and Home for Cooperation (Nicosia). The screening in Cyprus, to mark World Poetry Day, attracted media attention in the national press and was featured as a TV news item due to Cypriot interest in the healing of divided societies. In fact, the film is considered useful in providing other post-conflict societies (including Croatia where it was screened to psychotherapists in Rovinj) a way of negotiating sensitive matters through being able to discuss how these matters are broached elsewhere. ICA audiences gave the film a maximum rating of excellence in questionnaires, and written responses include: 'I loved the film. I thought the choice of speakers was both wise and wide-gives a good picture of the situation on the ground. Great camerawork and directorial approach'; 'I thought it was an incredibly moving and thoughtful offering, and I was really interested in what you said afterwards about Lebanon as an example.' Copies have been requested by students and institutions for further study of the work, and it was most recently screened at CULTNAT in Cairo, October 2016 at an event on community engagement through the arts to inform cultural heritage work in Islamic Cairo.

The programme's Citizen Academia workshops in London and Beirut and Cairo have strengthened network ties around the role of arts activism in strengthening civil societies. The final session of the Cairo workshop entailed its organisers (Rooney, El Hamamsy and Abu Bakr) discussing how a popular culture network could be established within Cairo for researchers, artists and interested others. This led directly to the establishment of the Forum for the Study of Popular Culture of which Rooney is a member. The Forum serves to create open access to research sources and to publicise relevant events, where popular culture can serve as an educational resource. Rooney's research has inspired other research programmes that draw on her arts activist methodologies, and she has been a speaker at RCUK workshops in India and Egypt that served to identify and set up new directions for impact-oriented research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A695BE25-52E9-4369-BD62-661A83BBD0E8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e07b79ecb492.56976318</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The four most significant outcomes of the programme are:
1. A Clarification of Understandings of the Common Ground
The notion of the common ground established in this research depends on differentiating between the predominant transnational strata of neoliberalism, extremism and the populist avant-garde. While all three strive respectively for global expression, a key finding is that while neoliberalism and extremism variously serve to undermine civil society as such, the populist avant-garde is motivated by the desire to rebuild and sustain civil society in ways both democratic and utopian. The research further serves to differentiate between 'utopian idealism' and 'utopian realism', analysing the former as pertaining to authoritarian ideologies and practices and the latter as pertaining to a politics and aesthetics of hope. 
2. The Identification of Counter-Narratives to Extremism
Regarding the endeavour to rebuild civil society, the programme conducted a case study of trust-building initiatives in Beirut, involving Lebanese journalists, NGO representatives, psychotherapists, artists and students from across the main sectarian divides (Christian, Sunni, Shia and Druze). In doing so, the research serves to identify some of the most effective counter-narratives in tackling sectarian divides in Lebanon, namely the strategic deployment of: national memory; individual and collective mourning; demands for socio-economic justice; the promotion of local traditions of popular culture or folklore and festive public gatherings.
3. The Foregrounding of Prisoner Rights in Conflict Situations
Following on from UK-based initiatives, and drawing on fieldwork and related research, the programme has explored how Israel makes use of its prison system to manage its security concerns with respect to Palestinian resistance to occupation, both actual and potential. This research has resulted in the following findings: how imprisonment may serve to radicalise those not previously radicalised and how the effects of the Israeli prison system result in a culture of desperation amongst Palestinian youth, actually rendering Israel less secure. In addition, this research shows how Israeli prison doctors are under the authority of the prison system in ways that compromise the medical rights of prisoners. The research also exposes the plight of Palestinian refugees through their long term and repeated displacements. 
4. Understanding the Arab Spring as a Cultural Revolution
The grant research findings also emerge out of broader questions of political negligence and the role of arts in development. While the initial intention was to extend the research regionally to Southern Africa and India, this over-ambitious aim was reduced to extending the regional focus across the Middle East. Through creating a popular culture network linking researchers and practitioners in the UK, Egypt and the Middle East, projects have demonstrated the extent to which the achievement (as opposed to obvious failure) of the Arab Spring has been an ongoing cultural revolution. Connected with this has been the methodological innovation of using arts activism to study arts activism, the initiatives of this programme serving to influence new research programmes. 
Overall, the programme demonstrates how the arts and culture constitute a crucial means of addressing extreme political, religious and socio-economic fragmentation in the Middle East.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research provides insight into how the arts can contribute to activism around peace-making, trust-building and the rebuilding or strengthening of civil societies. It does this through offering both counter-narratives and counter-investments (emotional and psychological) to those of extremism, as well as to those of neoliberalism. This could be taken forward in terms of the re-evaluation of the dynamics of nationalism in the context of divided societies in the Middle East and beyond; and in terms of new approaches to transnationally held democratic values. It could further be taken forward in examining popular culture as a form of self-education. The research also identifies impasses in the progress towards a resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and as such could be useful in efforts to re-start a peace process. It further addresses needed reforms pertaining to political prisoners as regards both physical and psychological health that are of increasing current concern. The research further draws attention to discrepancies between authoritarian discourses and revolutionary or liberationist ones in terms of literal and aesthetic uses of language. The project itself will be taking this forward regarding how different understandings of the sacred and the secular are embedded in different understandings of linguistic signification.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>99068414-ACB6-419F-B34D-27E7CE9CC142</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e07e20a63092.45247201</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative
