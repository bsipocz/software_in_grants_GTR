Projections suggest that the epidemic will continue to grow with 5 million new victims and 3 million deaths each year. HIV is universally fatal without treatment as patients succumb to opportunistic infections as a result of profound host immunosuppression. There are currently only two classes of anti-retroviral drugs, which suppress HIV. In the long-term their efficacy may be limited by the emergence of viral resistance. This study will focus on a unique group of HIV infected individuals who have shown no evidence of HIV disease progression. The virus appears to have a mutation in a gene called nef, which is central to the pathogenesis of HIV. One of its functions is to downregulate a group of T cells which have a molecule called CD4 on their surface. This is thought to be the mechanism by which profound immunodeficiency ensues in HIV infected patients. The ?non-progressing? HIV patients with nef mutations have been closely followed and there is evidence that they are now developing the disease. This provides an experimental opportunity to study the importance of nef in the disease and may lead to insights, which will allow the development of new therapeutic targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The fortuitous discovery that some patients with non-progressive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had genetic modifications of the nef gene raises the possibility that this gene could be a therapeutic target. The time between HIV infection and development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) syndrome varies widely. A small number of patients have been identified who have remained well for more than 10 years following infection - known as long-term non-progressors (LTNP) - who maintain high CD4 counts and low viral loads. Some of these patients have a mutation or deletion in the nef gene which in some cases prevents downregulation of CD4 molecules on T cells. One of these patients (005 -Chelsea and Westminster cohort) has now started to progress. I propose to identify the basis of this by cloning and sequencing the most recent nef alleles of this patient and comparing them with previously cloned mutant nef genes. The sequence of HIV nef from blood samples derived from 005 in 2004 will be determined and compared with alleles sequenced in 1993, 1996 and 2002. The study will be expanded to include other LTNP patients with nef mutations, some of whom are also now progressing, in London and Sydney. The functional activity of mutant and repaired Nef proteins on T cells will be assessed using cell biology techniques. The effect of variation in nef on virus productivity will be measured using a reverse transcriptase assay and p24-specific capture ELISA. The effect of mutant nef alleles on CD4 expression in transfected primary CD4 or human cell lines will be assessed using FACs analysis. The effect of Nef on viral fusion with the cell membrane will be monitored using HIV virus particles tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein. Interactions of wild type Nef and mutant Nef proteins with previously described Nef targets implicated in CD4 downregulation will be explored using confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation. The important clinical consequences conferred by the deletion in 005 may suggest that Nef has a hitherto unknown protein partner in T-cells. Proteomic analysis will therefore be performed, looking for interactions between Nef and proteins present in lipid rafts, which might interact at the site marked or affected by the deletion in Nef. Ultimately, understanding of the functional defects in the Nef mutants may require structural analysis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>227851</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G84/6712</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
