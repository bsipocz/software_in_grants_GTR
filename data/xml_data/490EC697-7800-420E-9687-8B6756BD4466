All students engaged in the EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership will be fully integrated into the Graduate School. The Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences acknowledges that the research student population is an important driver for research &amp;amp; for the future of academy in its broadest sense, and is committed to working with the Graduate School to ensure students receive a world-class experience.
The EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership at Queen's will provide support for 20 PhD positions in 2016-17 and 17 places in 2017-18. Queen's recognises the need to provide broad support for research excellence &amp;amp; as such distributes studentships across a number of disciplinary areas. Awards will principally be allocated in - Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Maths and Physics and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Studentships will be available in areas of strategic importance for the University including Cyber Security, Green Chemistry, Healthcare Technologies, Analytical Science and Sustainable Energy.
Details of the DTP doctoral opportunities can be found on the respective School websites:

Queen's is committed to supporting the strengthening of existing and building of new industrial collaborations. We will offer a number of PhD projects which involve collaboration with industry. Details of these CASE studentships can also be found on the School websites. A small number of international studentships will be available principally within the Global Research Institute in Electronics, Communications and Information Technology.Queen's is committed to supporting and developing the next generation of researchers and has a strong track record of doctoral training &amp;amp; progression. Over the duration of the PhD programme, all DTP students will have the opportunity to engage in a wide range of different training and development opportunities delivered through a combination of formal training &amp;amp; integrated learning experiences, such as placements and project-based initiatives. The transferable skills training component is mainly delivered through the Postgraduate Researcher Development Programme, managed by the Graduate School. The PRDP is developed in line with Vitae's Researcher Development Framework. The Programme offers students a comprehensive range of training courses, 1-2-1 support and skills development opportunities. Transferable skills training courses include; presentation skills, writing skills, communication skills and specialist knowledge skills such as enterprise, ethics and IP. Recruitment is undertaken at a School level with support from the University's central Admission Office. A defined set of assessment criteria and minimum standards for previous academic performance are adopted. Prospective supervisors will be informed of the distribution of studentships in November and then subsequent to an external application process (details available on the School websites) students will be informed of the outcome in Jan</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2471756</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509541/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
