At the same time, continuing regional diversity is attested. &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The proposed study is a sociolinguistic investigation of language variation and change in one of the northernmost areas of Britain, the Shetland Isles, in order to establish what is changing and what is not in this dialect, and why. We examine a number of key variable forms, such as Sees du yun?/Do you see that? across three generations of speakers from Lerwick to reveal whether local dialect features are being replaced by more widespread/standard norms. &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The specific goals of the project are to collect a large corpus of spoken data from 30 speakers stratified by age and gender; to produce a fully-transcribed database of vernacular Shetland speech; to compare linguistic features which are known to vary in the dialect through statistical analyses of their use. Ultimately, we wish to address the competing influences, both social and linguistic, which lead to variation and change in this traditionally isolated, relic dialect. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80102</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Shetland dialect presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>830BD3EA-2648-4DD1-8618-3A617B171E66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a talk to a large audience of local community members in Lerwick, Shetland, in order to disseminate our results at the grass roots level.

However, these claims were largely based on observation, rather than rigorous research. Our research addressed that gap by providing an empirical quantitative investigation of language use across three generations of speakers in this community. We found that in the youngest generation, half of the speakers continued to use the dialect extensively, whereas the other half used very few dialect forms in their speech. These results suggests that the Lerwick dialect may indeed indicate the first signs of rapid obsolescence of the local dialect in favour of more standard norms. 
We also conduced a follow up study to test the claim that our results did not show obsolescence per se, but were merely the reflection of 'bidialectalism' in this community, where speakers have access to both standard and dialect in their linguistic repertoire. In the case of the younger speakers, some of them chose to use their 'standard voice' in the original recordings, and others their 'dialect voice', hence the split in use. To test this possibility, we returned to the community and recorded the younger speakers 1) with a community 'insider' and 2) with a community outsider. These new results confirmed our original findings: half of the younger speakers only spoke in standard, regardless of whether they were talking to an insider or outsider. 
New research questions: These findings provide concrete evidence for dialect shift in a hitherto distinct variety of Scots and in the changing linguistic landscape of the UK more generally. However, it also raises the question of how such a shift occurs. Does it take place in the preschool years through the lack of dialect use by caregivers in the home? Or does formal schooling play a part in dialect loss? And what of the increasing globalisation of English through e.g. internet access? These results provide a wealth of questions for future linguistic research. 

New research resource: we created a large-scale fully searchable database of vernacular Lerwick speech (approx. 300,000 words). This provides a high quality archival record of a dialect which may disappear in the coming years. It also provides a resource for linguistic research in other areas beyond sociolinguistics: the text to sound aligned corpus can be used across a variety of platforms, and can yield detailed spectrographic, syntactic and semantic analyses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Non-academic: one of the aims of the Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland is to develop the study of the Scots language. However, the resources available for such study are sparse, and largely confined to historical data. The text to sound aligned corpus arising from the research can be made available to educationalists to use in the preparation of materials for contemporary dialect study in the classroom. 

Academic: to date, the corpus has been subject to a number of linguistic analyses, used by sociolinguistics, phoneticians and syntacticians. Beyond linguistics, the corpus provides an invaluable resource for folk historians in investigating the numerous narratives of past lives in Shetland.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>862FF556-B136-4756-8BBF-E9A1BDD06F43</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545c9bf508bfb5.66351917</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A 300,000 word text to sound aligned corpus of vernacular speech from three generations of speakers in Lerwick, Shetland.</gtr:description><gtr:id>42CF6887-4B64-4EEE-9B69-B565609C59B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The quantitative analysis of the recorded speech from this database was used in a follow up qualitative study by the RA on the project, Mercedes Durham, a questionnaire based study of dialect attitudes of high school children in Shetland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621a34797383.56209539</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Shetland generational corpus</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A 70,000 word speech to sound aligned corpus of spoken data.
