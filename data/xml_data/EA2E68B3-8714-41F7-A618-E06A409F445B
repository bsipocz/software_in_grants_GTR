These conflicts create extreme antagonism between neighbouring nations, such as India and Pakistan; they have led to the creation of entire new countries in the postcolonial period, such as Bangladesh; and they have led to civil war situations within nations, as seen in Sri Lanka; moreover, entire regions, such as Kashmir, remain disputed territory capable of even provoking nuclear war. These political conflicts are matched and complicated by social and class conflicts within South Asian nations. As part of the densely populated, so-called developing world, both urban and rural spaces in South Asia are sites of linked struggles over economic, cultural and social resources. To be South Asian today is to negotiate multiple conflicts within spaces of belonging that range from the home to the nation. Yet, while political and social conflicts divide populations and nations, culture, tradition, language and religion also bring them together. Both my research and Shisha's artistic programming ask a question that is both philosophical and political: can art practices that draw on these rich shared traditions create spaces of emotion, memory and understanding that are alternative to the violence, trauma and bitterness created by political conflict? Can they form an alternative source of knowledge, telling us new things about the links between the large scale conflicts between and within nations, and the micro-level conflicts within the home? How can we use art to lessen, or even offer solutions to these conflicts? \n\nThere is, moreover, another, fundamental shared experience that cross-cuts the alternative web of identifications that art practice makes visible: the burden of being a woman in a society grappling with complicated questions of tradition, modernity and identity. From the colonial period onwards, when the British Empire sought to modernise its Indian subjects, to the anti-colonial struggle for freedom, when nationalist symbols were being created to mobilise large groups, to the postcolonial period, marked by religious, cultural and national revivalisms, the woman, and her body, have been used to express collective identity, honour, shame, and pride. As a result, women in South Asia have been protected, exalted and, equally, made the brutal target of abduction, mutilation and rape during political conflict, beginning from the bloody birth of contemporary South Asia during the Partition of India. Thus 'Home, Nation, Body' specifically focuses on how, in contemporary South Asia, women artists are using this complex legacy to critique and offer solutions to political and social conflict. It asks how, in confronting and responding to conflict, women artists from across South Asia bridge political, class and religious divides through a creative, feminine, and feminist solidarity. It will highlight how women's art in South Asia chooses to address conflict in order to create potent modes of activism and self-empowerment.\n\nVisual art, however, needs to be appreciated and viewed in the public domain to complete the process of meaning-making. How can the museum or gallery become a powerful space for creating new means of empathy and understanding? Shisha are building on diverse academic relationships to explore these very questions. Working together on the proposed exhibition, therefore, we will enable UK audiences to learn how South Asian women artists debate conflict, war, and peace through an artistic, anti-masculinist focus on nation, home and body. This is a valuable, much-needed opportunity for British audiences of South Asian and non-South Asian heritage to participate in the concerns of a region historically and culturally linked to Britain, and that now, because of the global politics of the post 9/11 age, it has become even more imperative to dialogue with.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>165929</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F008635/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp; Sound Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
