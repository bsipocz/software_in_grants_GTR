The Lab offered participants the opportunity to build project teams and at the end, creative project ideas were presented to a group of mentors and advisors who gave feedback. Participants will now have the opportunity to apply to QMUL/PPP for direct project funding to refine their ideas and develop them further.

It will:

* Support communication structures between November 2015-March 2016, providing translation and convening regular meetings between between the 20 Creative Lab participants, to support the continuing work of partnerships and working teams formed at the Creative Lab

* Set up and run a project grant application process to award individual grants to teams for the direct costs of making an anticipated 4-5 projects to be shown publicly in Rio's Multiplicity/Multiplicidade Festival in 2016, setting appropriate grant reporting structures in place

* provide infrastructure staffing and central resourcing (such as venues for making, equipment, etc) to support producing/production of the projects within Multiplicidade Festival 2016 in Rio de Janeiro

* provide a return visit to Rio de Janeiro for the UK participants to sustain their contribution to the project outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project teams will undertake second-stage research to explore how art, design, research and digital technologies can help to build, develop and strengthen cohesive communities of socially-engaged citizens. The concept of Social Change in this context is conceived broadly. Examples might include, but are not limited to:

* cultural responses developed in places of violence and conflict;

* entrepreneurial initiatives that are creating new markets and employment within peripheral communities;

* health and wellbeing benefits in the absence of adequate public health care;

* questions about faith and spirituality in the cultural production of social cohesion;

* the challenges of Brazil's models of multi-culturalism in the context of its indigenous and African heritage.


This stage will enable funded teams to produce their project for showing to the public in a high profile festival in Rio de Janeiro. This impact will be seen by the general public, press, and a policy audience in Multiplicity/Multiplicidade Festival, after the conclusion of the research outlined here. 

Multiplicity's timescale has changed in 2016 to ensure that the Festival as a whole benefits from the world attention generated by the Rio 2016 Olympiad.

The PI and Co-I team, in partnership with CreativeWorks London and People's Palace Projects, will continue to monitor the projects to conclusion and ensure that documentation includes the impacts of the project outputs.

It is anticipated that the intensive relationships developed over the five months' collaboration on the funded projects will also result in long term relationships which support further UK-Brazil creative collaboration focused on social challenges: and that AHRC will apply the learning from engaging with the model of Creative Lab Brazil in future Labs in various Newton countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>225402</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Rio de Janeiro</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Utopias</gtr:description><gtr:id>D215248F-DA94-4651-B434-25754EA01CFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MICROUTOPIAS, an interactive installation combining short film clips triggered by people exploring the map of the Complexo da Mar&amp;eacute;, and photographs played via bicycle, was showcased at Galp&amp;atilde;o Bela Mar&amp;eacute; on 14th May 2016. Young participants from community groups in Mar&amp;eacute; and from Spectaculu theatre school presented an open rehearsal of a performance exploring their own personal ideas of Utopia, directed by Alessandra Vannucci.

The UTOPIAS seminar began on 18th May at Oi Futuro Flamengo with a public panel at which speakers included Charles Feitosa (UNIRIO), Paul Heritage, Silke Kapp (Federal University of Minas Gerais) and Brazilian public thinker Heloisa Buarque de Hollanda, followed by a discussion. The youth group also presented their final performance on the theme of Utopia. These events were attended by an estimated 80 people.

On 19th May at Centro de Artes da Mar&amp;eacute; and Galp&amp;atilde;o Bela Mar&amp;eacute;, the project staged a one day takeover in Portuguese and English, including the MICROUTOPIAS installation running all day, a seminar introduced by the Directors of Redes da Mar&amp;eacute; and mediated by Cecilia Dinardi, with speakers including Marcus Faustini, Paul Heritage, Jailson de Souza e Silva, and Jerry Brotton and Joad Raymond as video contributors on the topic of More's Utopia; an afternoon of workshops and performances, with contributors including Tania Alice, Rodrigo Abreu and Alexandre Mendes, Navega&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Desilha, with Livia Flores and Ronald Duarte, and other invitees. An afternoon debate on Utopia mediated by Alessandra Vannucci featured contributors including Tania Alice, Marcia Tiburi, and Franco La Cecla (Bologna University). The seminar closed with a musical performance. It was attended by an estimated 40 people in addition to the young performers - a mixture of Mar&amp;eacute; residents and those from wider Rio who had engaged with other CreativeLab events during the week.

Jerry Brotton and Paul Heritage, both involved in the Utopias discussion, identified an opportunity to extend the impact of the research by working with artists from one of Brazil's remaining indigenous communities on the theme of Utopias. Alongside this, the MICROUTOPIAS films from the installation could be re-staged.

On the occasion of the 5th centenary of the publication of UTOPIA (1516), a work by the English philosopher Thomas More, this project mounted an international, transdisciplinary and immersive colloquium, which enabled participants to exercise their utopic potential through living experience, interaction and performance. Talks, seminars and discussions were programmed alongside a series of workshops exploring movement and relationships between people, a drama performance by young people exploring their personal sense of Utopia, and an exhibition of photo and video portraits about micro-utopias already existing at Mar&amp;eacute; (MICROUTOPIAS). 

The aim was to revive the subject of &amp;quot;utopia&amp;quot; beyond its historical failings, restoring the potency of the word invited by More: a happy place that does not exist, but which may come to exist in the future. At a very sensitive moment in Brazilian public life (the seminar was staged during the month the President was impeached), as conflicting promises of future govern our urban life and resistance movements take to the streets of our cities, the project offered a provocation: is it still possible to envision a better world, like many utopists have done in the past?</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Utopias'; contributed ideas and contacts for speakers at the 2 days of seminar and discussion activities, with Paul Heritage and Jerry Brotton both contributing directly; and provided technical assistance to mount the MICROUTOPIAS installation.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mar?

The Gambiarra Lab was a networked collaboration, showcase and online exchange produced by B3 Media (Marc Boothe and Shazad Khalid), involving emerging young artists based between Rio and London exploring themes around social change and identity through music, film, digital art and spoken word.

Based on &amp;quot;the science of gambiarra&amp;quot;, which is a Brazilian cultural practice of solving problems creatively in a context of scarcity - much like &amp;quot;jugaad innovation&amp;quot; - the Lab supported a small cohort of young UK and Brazilian artists who demonstrate exceptional talent and have great potential to engage with a large number of regional and international audience through mentorship and other supports provided by a network of established creative artists and digital expert in Brazil and the UK.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Gambiarra Lab'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Rio de Janeiro</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Affective Map</gtr:description><gtr:id>A19994DA-7A53-4C4B-B9AA-7F2F437EB5D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project was presented as an interactive installation on 17th May 2016 at Oi Futuro Flamengo as part of Day II of the LabCriativo / CreativeLab showcase (reported as an Event output).

This project developed a prototype of an art/social-science/neuro-science collaboration and generated innovative new methodologies for sensing, recording and creatively expressing affective responses to journeys through the Favela neighborhood. The project, involving close collaboration between Cardiff University (Julian Brigstocke), the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Cristina Amazonas Cabral, Maira Monteiro Fr&amp;oacute;es and Eliana Sousa Silva), and Redes da Mar&amp;eacute;, used cutting-edge sensors, in combination with more conventional social-scientific research methods, to generate innovative new ways of sensing, knowing and representing routes through a community that is stigmatized, contested, and suffers from ongoing violence. It contributed to recent community-led initiatives to generate the first maps of the community, as well as involving members of the community as researchers. This data was used to create an art installation designed by Cristina Amazonas Cabral that enabled the public to engage with the methods and results of the research by exploring visual perception, cognition and performance alongside sensitively-presented and anonymised testimonies from the female participants-researchers on the effects of pervasive experiences of violence against women and girls within their community.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'An Affective Map of Everyday Journeys in the Mare?

#RioVisivel was a participatory and performance initiative that celebrated the everyday diversity of Rio and provided its people with unique, creative and timely opportunity to explore the theme of visibility. 

The project developed its theme around two main actions: &amp;quot;Podia&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Seremos Crime?/Shall We Be Crime?&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Podia&amp;quot; (Kate Stewart, Kazz Morohashi, Tiago Cosmo) was a participatory experience that involved a series of physical podia placed in some key and some more hidden areas of Rio, providing a platform for cariocas (citizens of Rio) to celebrate their spirit and individuality. Contributors were photographed and filmed, and with permission their celebrations of winning characteristics in themselves and their friends and families were filmed and recorded in order to stage an audio-visual installation at Oi Futuro Flamengo. 

&amp;quot;Seremos Crime&amp;quot; (Charles Feitosa, Renato Rezende) provided another platform for certain community groups and individuals to appear in spaces and places they are not normally seen. Seremos Crime was a critical approach to demonstrating visibility. It challenged the normalisation of a split city (similar to apartheid) in Rio de Janeiro and, more specifically, the recently approved Terrorism Bill, which represents a major setback for human rights and civil liberties in the country.

The Museum of Living Exchange (MoLE) inverts the traditional structure of a museum. Unlike the traditional museum, MoLE does not bring visitors into a closed environment to experience high culture. Rather the curators are the museum and offer themselves out to each other and to the public for live exchanges of stories, objects and experiences around themes of hope and future possibility.

The project enabled the group to produce a small series of prototypes that facilitated a live exchange between small groups of people around themes of hope and future possibility. The purpose of MoLE was to use live exchange as a method for opening up pathways for resilience, mobility and growth. Specifically, MoLE focused on addressing questions and challenges in Brazil for:
? Visibility and civic participation of underrepresented groups; 
? Sustainable strategies for inclusivity and resilience (to overcome disability, disenfranchisement, deprivation and other structural inequalities); 
? Health and wellbeing benefits in the absence of adequate public health care (i.e. opening pathways for accessibility and rehabilitation)

through activities including kite making, dance workshops that integrated dancers with physical disabilities, and highly engaging musical performances for young children; and an interactive sound installation that encouraged the public to reflect on their own relationship with others in the space, experimenting with movements that responded to others' presence.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Museum of Living Exchange'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>City, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Trem Transcultural / Transcultural Train</gtr:description><gtr:id>23CBF849-9F5E-4B2B-A447-17DCAFD6E711</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The installation element of the project was presented on 17th May 2016 at Oi Futuro Flamengo as part of Day II of the LabCriativo / CreativeLab showcase (reported as an Event output), reaching a public audience of over 100 people.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df105b3e2e61.99367293-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Creative Lab Artist-Researchers: Cecilia Dinardi, Charles Feitosa, Alessandra Vannucci, Slow Dabf

This project aimed to pilot and test the viability of producing a cultural programme performed in a public train service going from the centre to the periphery of Rio de Janeiro. The research consisted of a series of elements, as follows:

1. Diagnostic-mapping of potential challenges for the artistic occupation of this kind of public transport - with the objective of informing the interactive exhibition curatorial board.
2. Pop-up engaged performances during 5 days in stations and a train running between Central Station - Ramal Santa Cruz (in partnership with Ag&amp;ecirc;ncia de Redes para a Juventude, the State run program &amp;quot;Favela Criativa&amp;quot; and the company Perfomances Sem Fronteiras). The pop-up interventions were filmed for screening at the exhibition showcase.
3. Interactive exhibition featuring a train model box at Multiplicidade Festival, inviting the public to think about fundamental questions that impact public transport and how an artistic occupation of trains could be achieved.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Piloto para um Trem Transcultural / Pilot for a Transcultural Train'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oi Futuro</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Producing and Delivery Partnership for exchange and showcase</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0C89986-F090-411C-A2F8-F740A691EC8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The curatorial and producing partnership and the provision of central producing and production support was an important enabling factor in ensuring that all of the projects funded by the CreativeLab process realised an output to show to a public audience during May 2016.

This project aimed to pilot and test the viability of producing a cultural programme performed in a public train service going from the centre to the periphery of Rio de Janeiro. The research consisted of a series of elements, as follows:

1. Diagnostic-mapping of potential challenges for the artistic occupation of this kind of public transport - with the objective of informing the interactive exhibition curatorial board.
2. Pop-up engaged performances during 5 days in stations and a train running between Central Station - Ramal Santa Cruz (in partnership with Ag&amp;ecirc;ncia de Redes para a Juventude, the State run program &amp;quot;Favela Criativa&amp;quot; and the company Perfomances Sem Fronteiras). The pop-up interventions were filmed for screening at the exhibition showcase.
3. Interactive exhibition featuring a train model box at Multiplicidade Festival, inviting the public to think about fundamental questions that impact public transport and how an artistic occupation of trains could be achieved.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Piloto para um Trem Transcultural / Pilot for a Transcultural Train'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mar?

Young participants from community groups in Mar&amp;eacute; and from Spectaculu theatre school presented an open rehearsal of a performance exploring their own personal ideas of Utopia, directed by Alessandra Vannucci.

The UTOPIAS seminar began on 18th May at Oi Futuro Flamengo with a public panel at which speakers included Charles Feitosa (UNIRIO), Paul Heritage, Silke Kapp (Federal University of Minas Gerais) and Brazilian public thinker Heloisa Buarque de Hollanda, followed by a discussion. The youth group also presented their final performance on the theme of Utopia. These events were attended by an estimated 80 people.

On 19th May at Centro de Artes da Mar&amp;eacute; and Galp&amp;atilde;o Bela Mar&amp;eacute;, the project staged a one day takeover in Portuguese and English, including the MICROUTOPIAS installation running all day, a seminar introduced by the Directors of Redes da Mar&amp;eacute; and mediated by Cecilia Dinardi, with speakers including Marcus Faustini, Paul Heritage, Jailson de Souza e Silva, and Jerry Brotton and Joad Raymond as video contributors on the topic of More's Utopia; an afternoon of workshops and performances, with contributors including Tania Alice, Rodrigo Abreu and Alexandre Mendes, Navega&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Desilha, with Livia Flores and Ronald Duarte, and other invitees. An afternoon debate on Utopia mediated by Alessandra Vannucci featured contributors including Tania Alice, Marcia Tiburi, and Franco La Cecla (Bologna University). The seminar closed with a musical performance. It was attended by an estimated 40 people in addition to the young performers - a mixture of Mar&amp;eacute; residents and those from wider Rio who had engaged with other CreativeLab events during the week.

Jerry Brotton and Paul Heritage, both involved in the Utopias discussion, identified an opportunity to extend the impact of the research by working with artists from one of Brazil's remaining indigenous communities on the theme of Utopias. Alongside this, the MICROUTOPIAS films from the installation could be re-staged. These proposals were included in a successful Follow-On Funding application to AHRC (reported as a Future Funding outcome)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df13a1d10450.84463445-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Creative Lab Artist-Researchers: Alessandra Vannucci, Bambo Soyinka, Cecilia Dinardi, Charles Feitosa, Clelio de Paula.

On the occasion of the 5th centenary of the publication of UTOPIA (1516), a work by the English philosopher Thomas More, this project mounted an international, transdisciplinary and immersive colloquium, which enabled participants to exercise their utopic potential through living experience, interaction and performance. Talks, seminars and discussions were programmed alongside a series of workshops exploring movement and relationships between people, a drama performance by young people exploring their personal sense of Utopia, and an exhibition of photo and video portraits about micro-utopias already existing at Mar&amp;eacute; (MICROUTOPIAS). 

The aim was to revive the subject of &amp;quot;utopia&amp;quot; beyond its historical failings, restoring the potency of the word invited by More: a happy place that does not exist, but which may come to exist in the future. At a very sensitive moment in Brazilian public life (the seminar was staged during the month the President was impeached), as conflicting promises of future govern our urban life and resistance movements take to the streets of our cities, the project offered a provocation: is it still possible to envision a better world, like many utopists have done in the past?</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Utopias'; contributed ideas and contacts for speakers at the 2 days of seminar and discussion activities, with Paul Heritage and Jerry Brotton both contributing directly; and provided technical assistance to mount the MICROUTOPIAS installation.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Rio de Janeiro</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Museu de Trocas Vivas / Museum of Living Exchange</gtr:description><gtr:id>85DA91EB-7F49-48A9-8F2B-E6A43A0AB505</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project organised interactive kite-making, dance/movement and music workshops with children and young people at Lona Cultural Mar&amp;eacute; on 14th May: the sound installation was showcased on 18th May at Oi Futuro Flamengo.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df0e942c69c0.23013569-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Creative Lab Artist-Researchers: Bambo Soyinka, Clelio de Paula, Julian Brigstocke, Lucinda Jarrett, Nicolas Espinoza, Slow Dabf, Tiago Cosmo, Viviane Macedo

The Museum of Living Exchange (MoLE) inverts the traditional structure of a museum. Unlike the traditional museum, MoLE does not bring visitors into a closed environment to experience high culture. Rather the curators are the museum and offer themselves out to each other and to the public for live exchanges of stories, objects and experiences around themes of hope and future possibility.

The project enabled the group to produce a small series of prototypes that facilitated a live exchange between small groups of people around themes of hope and future possibility. The purpose of MoLE was to use live exchange as a method for opening up pathways for resilience, mobility and growth. Specifically, MoLE focused on addressing questions and challenges in Brazil for:
? Visibility and civic participation of underrepresented groups; 
? Sustainable strategies for inclusivity and resilience (to overcome disability, disenfranchisement, deprivation and other structural inequalities); 
? Health and wellbeing benefits in the absence of adequate public health care (i.e. opening pathways for accessibility and rehabilitation)

through activities including kite making, dance workshops that integrated dancers with physical disabilities, and highly engaging musical performances for young children; and an interactive sound installation that encouraged the public to reflect on their own relationship with others in the space, experimenting with movements that responded to others' presence.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Museum of Living Exchange'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen Mary University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>People's Palace Projects</gtr:department><gtr:description>Producing and Delivery Partnership for exchange and showcase</gtr:description><gtr:id>E94EA7AA-A7F3-4523-9256-DB306AA46481</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The curatorial and producing partnership and the provision of central producing and production support was an important enabling factor in ensuring that all of the projects funded by the CreativeLab process realised an output to show to a public audience during May 2016.

&amp;quot;Other Registers&amp;quot; is an installation work that aims to let the public experience the violence in Rio de Janeiro in a poetic way through the use of data and sound. The project takes homicide data resulting from fatal interactions between Rio's Military Police Force and civilians in the 2012-2016 period as the source material and translates them into sound, through a process of sonification. The use of sonification is an innovative way to bring data closer to the general public.

The Lab:
? Worked with frugal resources (Raspberry Pi computers and recycled materials) to create new musical instruments that stimulated curiosity and playfulness 
? Gave 14 emerging artists valuable experiences of collaboration and international working at professional standard
? Shared good practice around heritage and arts as a force for social change
? Produced a multimedia project curated by young emerging Brazilian artists, using photography, film, digital media and spoken word
? Shared its film and digital content via a media channel on Vimeo and a Facebook page (listed as Engagement outputs)
? Shared best practice as part of a live showcase and talk in both Mar&amp;eacute; (on 14th May 2016 to audiences of approx. 40) and Flamengo, downtown Rio de Janeiro, (on 16th May 2016 to audiences of over 100) (both listed as Engagement outputs).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df0bbaaa33e5.28199855-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Creative Lab Artist-Researchers: Marc Boothe, Tiago Cosmo.

The Gambiarra Lab was a networked collaboration, showcase and online exchange produced by B3 Media (Marc Boothe and Shazad Khalid), involving emerging young artists based between Rio and London exploring themes around social change and identity through music, film, digital art and spoken word.

Based on &amp;quot;the science of gambiarra&amp;quot;, which is a Brazilian cultural practice of solving problems creatively in a context of scarcity - much like &amp;quot;jugaad innovation&amp;quot; - the Lab supported a small cohort of young UK and Brazilian artists who demonstrate exceptional talent and have great potential to engage with a large number of regional and international audience through mentorship and other supports provided by a network of established creative artists and digital expert in Brazil and the UK.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Gambiarra Lab'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen's University Belfast</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Outros Registros / Other Registers</gtr:description><gtr:id>9404D94F-04E6-4DFF-9739-CFA340F1F356</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project presented an installation output on 17th May 2016 at Oi Futuro Flamengo as part of LabCriativo / CreativeLab Showcase Day II, together with a debate on public security in Rio featuring contributions from Eliana Sousa Silva (Redes da Mar&amp;eacute;) and Silvia Ramos (Centre for Studies in Security &amp;amp; Citizenship, Candido Mendes University).

&amp;quot;Other Registers&amp;quot; is an installation work that aims to let the public experience the violence in Rio de Janeiro in a poetic way through the use of data and sound. The project takes homicide data resulting from fatal interactions between Rio's Military Police Force and civilians in the 2012-2016 period as the source material and translates them into sound, through a process of sonification. The use of sonification is an innovative way to bring data closer to the general public. Through musicalisation, we transform a horrific phenomenon into something beautiful, sometimes sounding consonant, sometimes dissonant but always letting the listener experience the numerical abstractness of statistics in a poetical way.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Other Registers'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mar?

#RioVisivel was a participatory and performance initiative that celebrated the everyday diversity of Rio and provided its people with unique, creative and timely opportunity to explore the theme of visibility. 

The project developed its theme around two main actions: &amp;quot;Podia&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Seremos Crime?/Shall We Be Crime?&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Podia&amp;quot; (Kate Stewart, Kazz Morohashi, Tiago Cosmo) was a participatory experience that involved a series of physical podia placed in some key and some more hidden areas of Rio, providing a platform for cariocas (citizens of Rio) to celebrate their spirit and individuality. Contributors were photographed and filmed, and with permission their celebrations of winning characteristics in themselves and their friends and families were filmed and recorded in order to stage an audio-visual installation at Oi Futuro Flamengo. 

&amp;quot;Seremos Crime&amp;quot; (Charles Feitosa, Renato Rezende) provided another platform for certain community groups and individuals to appear in spaces and places they are not normally seen. Seremos Crime was a critical approach to demonstrating visibility. It challenged the normalisation of a split city (similar to apartheid) in Rio de Janeiro and, more specifically, the recently approved Terrorism Bill, which represents a major setback for human rights and civil liberties in the country. The project projected images of real people in places or at events that they are not normally welcomed or allowed to be, or public spaces they were banned from. For example, inhabitants of favelas in expensive shopping centers of Ipanema or Leblon; middle-class people in drug selling corners of Mar&amp;eacute;; convicted demonstrators in public places or public gatherings; youngsters killed by the police (like Rafael Neris) in the buildings of a federal University, etc. This was complemented by a film reflecting on the social consequences of the concept and reality of citizens' presence being banned or invisible.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Rio Visivel' and Paul Heritage introduced the group to three NGOs which engaged with the process and whose participants contributed material for the video installation: Agencia de Redes para a Juventude, Redes da Mar&amp;eacute; and Spectaculu.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cardiff University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Affective Map</gtr:description><gtr:id>C391D274-4EAD-445C-A464-65C95FB53C11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project was presented as an interactive installation on 17th May 2016 at Oi Futuro Flamengo as part of Day II of the LabCriativo / CreativeLab showcase (reported as an Event output).

The Museum of Living Exchange (MoLE) inverts the traditional structure of a museum. Unlike the traditional museum, MoLE does not bring visitors into a closed environment to experience high culture. Rather the curators are the museum and offer themselves out to each other and to the public for live exchanges of stories, objects and experiences around themes of hope and future possibility.

The project enabled the group to produce a small series of prototypes that facilitated a live exchange between small groups of people around themes of hope and future possibility. The purpose of MoLE was to use live exchange as a method for opening up pathways for resilience, mobility and growth. Specifically, MoLE focused on addressing questions and challenges in Brazil for:
? Visibility and civic participation of underrepresented groups; 
? Sustainable strategies for inclusivity and resilience (to overcome disability, disenfranchisement, deprivation and other structural inequalities); 
? Health and wellbeing benefits in the absence of adequate public health care (i.e. opening pathways for accessibility and rehabilitation)

through activities including kite making, dance workshops that integrated dancers with physical disabilities, and highly engaging musical performances for young children; and an interactive sound installation that encouraged the public to reflect on their own relationship with others in the space, experimenting with movements that responded to others' presence.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>People's Palace Projects made a grant to the partnership to carry out research on the project 'Museum of Living Exchange'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshops by &quot;The Museum of Living Exchange&quot; project, 14th May 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9306C200-196A-4F8C-802B-245B88D29308</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dance, poetry, music, graffiti and kite-making workshops engaged with around 40 young people at Lona Cultural Herbert Vianna, a community arts centre run by partner organisation Redes da Mar&amp;eacute;, in Rio's largest favela, Complexo da Mar&amp;eacute; - one of the most excluded communities in the city and subject to extreme levels of violence from drug gangs and police, poor educational, social and healthcare provision.

The installation consisted of an interactive, sensor-based map painted on the floor with fluorescent light, which projected 16 short video-portraits of favela residents engaged in creative initiatives, describing what utopias meant for them and sharing their hopes for a better future. Cecilia Dinardi wrote the curatorial statement of the installation, which commemorated the 500th anniversary of Thomas More's publication, Utopia, and explored the relevance of the utopia concept for understanding the place of favelas in contemporary cities. The installation also included the work of photographers Rat&amp;atilde;o Diniz, Douglas Lopes and Antonello Venneri, showing ordinary life at the Mar&amp;eacute; favela.

A project that has already seen particular impact has been Outros Registros / Other Registers, which has been invited for re-presentation at a seminar on public security in Rio de Janeiro and has been used as a way of stimulating local discussion about favela residents' right to public security provision from the police and ways in which police violence can be challenged and reduced. A presentation on the project was given at an electronic music conference in Seoul, encouraging peers in experimental sound technology to explore applying electronic music to social outcomes and to use audio means of presentation of significant data. It is hoped the installation will also be re-staged in the UK.

Findings from this award about:
1. Successful ways to stimulate research collaborations and creative innovation in research in overseas development contexts 
2. Themes likely to generate valuable research collaborations 
have been reported back within AHRC and to RCUK and have influenced strategic planning for the rollout of Newton Fund and Global Challenges Research Fund calls.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6BAD990C-F275-4C5B-81F3-A730675B6E4D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d71a6d6ea6f3.39741813</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded on this second-stage grant explored how art, design, research and digital technologies can help to build, develop and strengthen cohesive communities of socially-engaged citizens, by supporting a total of 8 research collaboration ideas that were born from the 10-day Immersion phase of CreativeLab run by AHRC with People's Palace Projects in Rio de Janeiro during October-November 2015.

Key findings included:

1) The project was successful in developing communities of socially-engaged citizens: several projects strengthened community ties and reflections on social participation in Rio (among participants/audiences) and a community of socially-engaged citizens was also built effectively among the researchers and creatives on the project, 19 out of 20 of whom have continued to communicate with each other and to collaborate (UK-UK, Brazil-Brazil and UK-Brazil), currently &amp;gt;9 months following the end of this phase of the project. 

2) The ability to introduce participants new to the Rio context to strong existing local partners and networks (in the intensive &amp;quot;Sandpit&amp;quot;, Phase 1) was demonstrated to be an important factor for successfully developing in Phase 2 a set of projects that explored new ways of applying creativity and research innovation around social transformation. Of the 8 projects developed, 6 partnered with Redes da Mar&amp;eacute;, 2 with Spectaculu, 1 with Olabi, 2 with Ag&amp;ecirc;ncia de Redes para Juventude [several projects had multiple partners]. Only one project did not collaborate with any local organisations.

3) Every collaborative process met challenges as the teams developed their ideas, but with the support of a strong coproducing partnership (People's Palace Projects and Multiplicidade) who secured venue partners, and a production crew liaising with each team and tracking each project's timeline, every project produced an output to show in the final festival. Several factors in the structuring of the project grants in Phase 2, agreed following the evaluation of the UnBox Labs (India) project that foreran CreativeLab, were understood as being key to delivering this:
a) Project teams were required to nominate their own lead recipient of the grant and were allowed to split their grant between UK and Brazilian recipients within the team. This avoided casting the UK research institutions as the financial controllers of each project and enabled the teams to negotiate their own decisionmaking structures, promoting co-production of the research.
b) People's Palace Projects/Multiplicidade and their local team of project assistants and production crew were able to provide centralised support to the teams with the logistics of international cooperation, from contracting in Portuguese to engaging local people as participants in the research processes, to sourcing partners and suppliers, to money transfer and making of payments, to organising transport and making of bespoke items, to risk-assessing the contexts they were working in. This enabled teams to focus more effectively on the research and creative aspects of their collaboration, and reduce the time they spent dealing with the practicalities of delivery. In a situation where researchers and creatives were already being asked to collaborate with other disciplines, adapt to collaborators' ways of working and apply their research in unfamiliar contexts, it was helpful to prioritise their learning in these areas, more likely to build transferable skills and capacity, rather than in logistics and management.
c) The commitment to enabling all of the researchers to attend a final showcase, and the timetabling of specific dates at a confirmed venue, gave all team members a creative investment in the delivery of their collaborative output and an incentive not to allow the timescale to slip.

4) The themes and topics that engaged and inspired the collaborative teams were:
- Urban violence and human rights: including violent conflict between police and residents of multiply excluded areas of the city, violence against women, the impact of fears around security on public transport usage
- Rights and visibility of excluded sectors of society
- Creative economy and skills development
- Agency and the transformative potential of human imagination in building a better society.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the context of strategic decisions by UK government to support the Newton Fund and now to work with the Research Councils and other distributors to create the Global Challenges Research Fund, knowledge and experience in supporting UK Arts and Humanities academics to apply their research to social challenges in cross-disciplinary research is increasingly important. The success of the CreativeLab project in not only supporting UK-Brazilian research collaboration and creative innovation, but in building in additional support in the development and production phase of the projects to ensure that all 8 were delivered, enables it to be built on as a model for future capacity-building projects that seek to stimulate cross-disciplinary international research collaboration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B05B89D2-D8E7-4C12-AD05-739581E62152</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df0b1721b871.83689103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://labcriativo.org/ebook/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice on creative economy investments given to State Government of Sao Paulo</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>South America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A59D596-B94E-4282-A622-08CAFEA32EFE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5898b724b98962.54532034</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4403BFC1-F57A-4048-957A-914C5D3F556E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Creative Lab / LabCriativo</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f89f7e1444ca93526eadfaee8a8becf6"><gtr:id>f89f7e1444ca93526eadfaee8a8becf6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shiach, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-85-64022-87-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58be0f581eff39.33245026</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N008855/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80B2D139-5178-4BB1-8333-64C582CE3EE4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Regional Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
