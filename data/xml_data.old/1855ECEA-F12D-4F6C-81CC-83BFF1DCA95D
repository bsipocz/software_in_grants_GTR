The system is prepared via a mixture of sodium nitrite and ascorbic, or citric, acid, which generates large amounts of exogenous NOx via the chemical reactions of acidified nitrite. The reaction mixture can be tailored for suitability to specific applications.

Our proposal is to deliver the solution in a liquid form to the stomach and oral cavity of mechanically ventilated patients. We believe use of this technology will significantly reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in these patients. 

There is now persuasive evidence that the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) play a key role in the maintenance of host defence against various microbial pathogens. In health, NOx is present in high concentrations in the stomach where it plays an important role in maintaining intragastric sterility and preventing gastrointestinal infections. Mechanically ventilated patients are usually sedated, they produce little or no saliva and their swallowing reflex is inhibited or abolished. VAP is caused by aspiration of infected secretions from the aerodigestive tract.

Our own pilot studies have confirmed that during critical illness, production of oxides of nitrogen, which play key roles in host defense is markedly reduced. This predisposes to colonization of the stomach and oral cavity by pathogenic bacteria and hence the subsequent development of VAP. Our NO-generating solution is designed to restore normal physiological activity of NOx by nasogastric and oral administration.

Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a lung infection occurring in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours [1]. The reported incidence of VAP varies from around 10% to more than 30%. It is estimated that over 60,000 patients are mechanically ventilated in UK intensive care units (ICUs) annually, with an average stay of five days and a cost of around &amp;pound;500M per annum (approx 1-2 % of the total NHS budget). VAP is the most prevalent infection in European ICUs, accounting for almost half of all ICU acquired infections. 

Our aim is to reduce significantly the incidence of VAP and the associated prolonged length of stay, morbidity, mortality and treatment costs. Pilot clinical studies with a prototype product will pave the way for future Phase III studies, dependent on confirmation of safety, efficacy and development of an easy-to-use delivery system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We have developed, a novel, non-enzymatic, system for exogenous generation and local delivery of nitric oxide (NO) and higher oxides of nitrogen (NOx).

Commercial partners to manufacture the NOx solution to clinical grade have been identified to make the product to be used in the clinical studies. In addition, product design work is being conducted for formulation and packaging of a commercial product ready for market once successful clinical studies have been completed.
The potential impact is huge. More than 60,000 patients are mechanically ventilated in UK intensive care units annually, with an average stay of five days and a cost of more than &amp;pound;500m. Up to a third of these patients develop pneumonia. The team envisage that their treatment will be administered to all patients in ICUs worldwide, being placed on a ventilator, to prevent development of pneumonia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243832</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Edixomed Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration Agreement with Commercial Partner</gtr:description><gtr:id>675ECF85-4A2F-405D-ABF9-5662DEF3378D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) The Collaboration Agreement between QMUL and Edixomed.

A liquid that restores the naturally occurring gas (Nitric Oxide) to prevent pneumonia in patients on breathing machines: A study to find the best dose'. We have developed a new system that generates and delivers nitric oxide and other oxides of nitrogen (NO/NOx) to the stomach and oral cavity of mechanically ventilated patients. We hypothesise that the use of this solution to decontaminate the mouth, upper throat and stomach will significantly reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically ventilated patients. During critical illness, production of NO is markedly reduced in the digestive tract. This deficiency predisposes to bacterial overgrowth of the stomach and oral cavity and the subsequent development of VAP following unwanted inhalation of infected secretions. The NO generating solution is designed to restore normal levels of NOx in the oral cavity and stomach. The objective of this therapy is to reduce the incidence of VAP and the associated prolonged length of stay, morbidity, mortality and treatment costs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>234BF0A3-F1FA-43F8-82F4-8FEA3EDC8E7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Other</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dee238eaa193.55143268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Refinement.
