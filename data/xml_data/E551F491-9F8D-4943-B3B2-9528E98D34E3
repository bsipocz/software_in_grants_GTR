Recent years have seen a surge of new developments in the area of graph polynomials, with many of these developments being driven by applications to other areas of scientific research, both within mathematics and outside of it. The Tutte polynomial is unquestionably the most heavily studied and important of all graph polynomials, and many, if not most, other graph polynomials are related to the Tutte polynomial in some way.

The Tutte polynomial has a vast body of work associated with it, across multiple fields, with applications in a wide range of other areas encompassing graph theory, topology, geometry, knot theory, biology, physics, and even sociology. There are entire books on just single facets of the Tutte polynomial; for example, on specialisations such as the chromatic polynomial, flows, and reliability, as well as on other formulations of the Tutte polynomial such as the Potts model, an important statistical mechanics model in physics. 

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts in the many wide-ranging properties and applications of the Tutte polynomial. Advances in this area tend to develop independently, each for their own particular application, but, because the Tutte polynomial is at the heart of all these various investigations, very frequently results in one field then lead to breakthroughs in another when the techniques are transferred. This workshop will provide a forum for effective sharing of related ideas, techniques and applications. It will also focus the field by communicating a set of open problems and applications-based objectives for future research on the Tutte polynomial and its applications across disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major impacts of this project will be to the health of the academic discipline and to worldwide academic advancement. The workshop aims to guide and unify the direction that research in graph polynomials will take in the short- and mid-term future. Participants will gain a full understanding of the latest research in their field and of how their research intersects with it. Researchers will leave with a focused set of problems that reflect the most recent advances in the field. Many of these problems will be driven by cross-disciplinary interactions.

The workshop aims to develop the understanding of graph polynomials that arise in statistical physics. Graph polynomials provide a combinatorial framework for describing nearest-neighbour interaction models such as the Potts and Ising models. A major area of physics is concerned with determining the phase transitions of these models. The combinatorial theory developed in this workshop has the potential to inform this physics research, leading to new understandings of the physics of matter. Of particular note in this direction is that improvements in computational methods, one of the topics of the workshop, should help physicists conduct exploratory research in statistical mechanics more effectively.

For self-assembly of nanoscale geometric constructs a number of techniques have been developed using the Watson-Crick complementarity properties of DNA strands to achieve the self-assembly. Ribbon graphs (equivalently, graphs in surfaces) give a good model of DNA nanostructures, and so the various generalisations of the Tutte polynomial to embedded graphs should encode valuable information pertinent to this application. Some models of biomolecular computing also require a biological process that can be modelled by processes used in recursive constructions for graph polynomials. Due to the appearances of graph polynomials in these settings, there is potential for the workshop to have impact on design strategies for nanostructures.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28287</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Corporate sponsorship - Elsevier</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Elsevier</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A6C170B9-3A64-43E8-96DE-EC2CFA01296C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d06937455602.18881014</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant was awarded to run a workshop on Tutte polynomial and its applications. The purpose of this workshop was to bring together international researchers with a wide range of interests in the Tutte polynomial and its applications for cross-fertilisation among the many fields that it touches, thus providing an effective forum for sharing ideas, techniques and applications. 

The workshop was held at Royal Holloway University of London over the period of 11th-14th July 2015 with the tile &amp;quot;Workshop on New Directions for the Tutte Polynomial: Extensions, Interrelations, and Applications&amp;quot;. It was an extremely successful event, generating a considerable amount of interaction and collaboration between various researchers. New connections between and results about mathematical structures were discovered as a direct result of the workshop (publications based on results of the workshop are currently being prepared by various groups of researchers). 

The workshop brought together forty four researchers on the Tutte polynomial and its application, of whom seven were post-doctoral researchers, and eight were PhD students. It had high international impact, with participants from six of the seven continents. Its participants included researchers on the combinatorial theory of the Tutte polynomial, as well as researchers who work on its applications in physics, computational complexity and biomathematics. The workshop consisted of thirty two short and focused talks with the purpose of communicating the latest developments and techniques in the presenter's area of specialism to researchers with other specialisms. Very frequently results in one field lead to breakthroughs in another when the techniques are transferred. There was a poster session for PhD students. Seven students displayed posters. The purpose of this was to provide trainee researchers with the opportunity to interact on a one-to-one basis with senior researchers, thus providing training and development opportunities. Highly successful breakout sessions for collaborative research were scheduled in the afternoon. These provided the workshop's participants with the opportunity to push forward ideas developed during the workshop. A problem session was held on the last day. During this researchers presented various open problems to guide future development of the field. Several researchers stayed in Royal Holloway beyond the workshop in order to develop research ideas from the workshop. 

The workshop attracted some additional corporate sponsorship from Elsevier. A special edition of the journal Advances in Applied Mathematics is being prepared to exhibit findings of the workshop to the broader community. 

The following researchers took part in the workshop. Spencer Backman (Rome), Joseph Bonin (George Washington University), Magnus Bordewich (Durham), Robert Brijder (Hasselt), Amanda Cameron (Queen Mary), Peter Cameron (St Andrews &amp;amp; Queen Mary), Sergei Chmutov (Ohio State), Carolyn Chun (Brunel), Julien Courtiel (Simon Fraser), Joanna Ellis-Monaghan (Saint Michael's College), Dong Fengming (Nanyang Technological University), Alex Fink (Queen Mary), Emeric Gioan (LIRMM), Andrew Goodall (Charles University), Graham Farr (Monash), Gary Haggard (Bucknell), Hendrik Jan Hoogeboom (Leiden), Sam Hopkins (MIT), Stephen Huggett (Plymouth), Jesper Jacobsen (&amp;Eacute;cole Normale Sup&amp;eacute;rieure), Mark Jerrum (Queen Mary), Yvonne Kemper (NIST), Christopher Knapp (Brunel), Martin Kochol (Slovak Academy of Sciences), Thomas Krajewski (Aix Marseille), Joseph Kung (North Texas), Rugare Kwashira (Witwatersrand), Matthias Lenz (Oxford), Johann Makowsky (Technion), Criel Merino (UNAM), Kerri Morgan (Monash), Iain Moffatt (Royal Holloway), Eunice Mphako-Banda (Witwatersrand), Gleb Nenashev (Stockholm), Steven Noble (Brunel), Seongmin Ok (DTU), James Oxley (Louisiana State University), Thomas Perrett (DTU), Irene Pivotto (Western Australia), Gordon Royle (Western Australia), Jesus Salas (Carlos IIIde Madrid), Ben Smith (Royal Holloway), Alan Sokal (UCL and NYU), William Whistler (Durham).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The purpose of the workshop was to provide an effective forum for sharing ideas, techniques and applications in the theory of the Tutte polynomial.
