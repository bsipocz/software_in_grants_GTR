Often the collection of states which satisfy some prescribed statistical law form a fractal set; a geometric object which displays intricate detail at all magnifications. This link between the dynamical behaviour of a system and the fractal geometry of certain subsets has led to it being used to model natural phenomena such as cloud boundaries and fluid turbulence.The first objective in my programme of research is the study of self-similar sets with overlap, a research topic which lies at the heart of dimension theory, and has strong connections with ergodic theory, dynamical systems, and geometric measure theory. Such sets, despite being defined in a simple fashion, display intricate detail and often have zero area or volume, and so the tools of classical geometry prove to be not so useful. Fractal dimension quantifies how irregular an object is and provides an important tool with which to analyse these sets.Imposing a technical condition on these sets has enabled a rich theory to be developed that has shown deep relations with fields such as ergodic theory and dynamical systems. In the case that no such condition is imposed only partial results are known. It is my intention to investigate the case where no separation conditions are assumed with a view of focussing on necessary conditions for the coincidence of the Hausdorff and symbolic dimensions. Even partial results in this direction would have a profound effect on our understanding of self-similarity, and would spawn an entirely new line of research in this field. My second objective is to investigate the statistical properties of open dynamical systems. Often a dynamical system will display sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which means that the long term behaviour of an individual orbit is extremely difficult to predict. Motivated by a similar problem in statistical physics mathematicians developed the thermodynamic formalism, which provides an avenue to study the long term behaviour of typical trajectories in the dynamical system. My overarching goal within this field is to gain a better picture of the statistical properties of these this phenomena in the context of open dynamical systems. A novel application of this research would be to the field of computer science. Lempel-Ziv-Welsch is an algorithm used for compressing data, which operates by relating certain sub-blocks of data. The techniques involved with this objective would directly apply in this setting and would afford us a better picture of the efficiency of this algorithm. Such a result would be of great interest to those working in the field of computer science.The final objective for the programme is the study of diophantine approximation in a fractal setting. Diophantine approximation is concerned with how well one may approximate real numbers by rationals. The classical setting for this work has been in Euclidean space with the Lebesgue measure, with one of the many highlights being the celebrated theorem of Khinchin. Recently, there has been great interest in studying these problems for fractal sets and measures, with a view of proving an analogue of Khinchin's theorem in this setting. There have been partial results in this direction, it is my intention to investigate these problems in the setting of self-similar measures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research to be undertaken during the fellowship will be innovative, ground breaking, and have application for mathematicians, the wider science community, and the general public. The proposed research is fundamentally pure in nature so the the major beneficiaries of my research will be principally those working in the fields of ergodic theory, dynamical systems and dimension theory. Beyond these confines, however, I believe that my research findings may also be exceedingly relevant; and I confidently anticipate that there will be significant direct and indirect interest from scientists working in related fields. Objective 1 deals with fundamental questions relating to the properties of self-similar sets. Such sets are long standing objects of interest in geometric measure theory. In addition, self-similarity is a recurring theme in across the sciences, having found applications in the fields of finance, fluid turbulence, and computer network traffic. Accordingly, I anticipate there will be a large audience for my research from pure mathematicians, as well as those working in the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology; computer scientists required to model ethernet traffic, and even financial mathematicians interested in the statistical self-similarity of share prices. The work related to objective 2 will be of interest to those working in applied dynamical systems, statistical physics, and computer science. Here, in the study of statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems, a major element is the thermodynamic formalism which involves ideas borrowed from statistical physics. This research will be of particular interest to applied mathematicians who have provided many numerical computations which support some of the conjectures I aim to investigate; and will have potential application to the computer science community through the Lempel-Ziv-Welsh data compression algorithm, which operates by parsing blocks of data into different words. My intention is to obtain detailed information about the first repetition function, which is related to Lempel-Ziv-Welsh by a theorem of Ornstein and Weiss. The aim in objective 3 is to better understand diophantine approximation from the point of view of fractal geometry. The research will be of immediate interest to those working in the fields of ergodic theory, fractal geometry and number theory. Diophantine approximation is also a crucial ingredient to KAM theory which has far reaching application to stability problems in classical mechanics and I anticipate therefore that those working in this field will be interested in my work. Finally, I believe that my findings will also have relevance to the general public and I will seek to explain the nub of the problem, its relevance, and my proposed solution in jargon-free, simple, lay terms on my website.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>232154</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0527FD56-7F1D-4F35-80D3-859D88282FC3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Slicing the Sierpinski gasket</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nonlinearity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae90ce20770a3dd113a758a08d8f7ecd"><gtr:id>ae90ce20770a3dd113a758a08d8f7ecd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>B?r?ny B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_49507674381375eca8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>18C981D8-8419-4F93-BA67-59B58A3CD03B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dimension of self-affine sets with holes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae Mathematica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3b821a5b2d87257d5d7b8bbeb448d1bb"><gtr:id>3b821a5b2d87257d5d7b8bbeb448d1bb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ferguson A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f84b2edc8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I024328/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>45</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>55</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
