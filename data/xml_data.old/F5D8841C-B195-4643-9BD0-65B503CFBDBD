The project will increase capabilities in sample exchange between institutions, enabling the analysis of nucleation on complex samples, increase reproducibility and accuracy of flux measurements, increase reproducibility and accuracy of temperature control, increase the number of material sources, enabling the growth of new materials, increase safety, reduce down-time of the system and increase control during surface preparation. The development of the MBE-LEEM will enable close collaboration between Cardiff University and EPSRC National Centre for III-V Technologies and with IQE, a world leading semiconductor wafer company. The system will be used for basic research, providing a wealth of data on nucleation dynamics and key epitaxial processes for theorists across UK, and providing industrial and academic partners with a unique characterization technique to determine optimum growth parameters in complex epitaxial processes by analysing growth dynamics. 

The extended capabilities of the MBE-LEEM will be tested by studying the nucleation of MnAs on InAs, determining the conditions for nucleation of Zinc-Blende MnAs. The nucleation of half-metallic MnAs on an InAs buffer layer with thickness below 2 monolayers was shown by Kim et al. in 2006, but the process has not been reproduced and no explanation on the mechanism leading to Zinc-Blende MnAs has been provided. MBE-LEEM will produce videos of the nucleation of MnAs on InAs with different thicknesses, highlighting the evolution of MnAs crystal structure and morphology during nucleation. 

The fabrication of half-metallic semiconductors can be key for the development of spintronics. Follow-up research is projected after this first grant development project in order to analyse magnetic properties of half-metallic MnAs, and to apply MBE-LEEM to other key research on epitaxial processes, such as the integration of GaAs on Silicon, or the nucleation of nanostructures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The development of MBE-LEEM system addresses the need of real-time, in-situ monitoring of thin film growth dynamics. MBE-LEEM increases thin film and nanostructure growth control and provides data that complements current characterization techniques to underpin growth mechanisms e.g. mechanisms behind the nucleation of nanostructrures, the nucleation of particular crystalline phases of a material or the nucleation and dynamics of defects.

MBE-LEEM will benefit academic and industrial R&amp;amp;D groups across UK, and contribute to the progress of a wide range of technologies such as nanoelectronics, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and photonics, defined as Key Enabling Technologies by the European Comission, and such as, Epitaxy on Silicon, VCELS, QD lasers, InGaAs and InAs transistors, Spintronics, Bismides and quantum information devices, technologies specified in the III-V roadmap elaborated by the National Centre for III-V technologies. During this development project the capabilities of the new MBE-LEEM will be demonstrated by applying it to study the epitaxial processes of III-V semiconductors and magnetic semiconductors. MBE-LEEM will contribute to consolidate the leading status of UK's III-Vs R&amp;amp;D, providing world leading capabilities on monitoring of growth dynamics of As-containing compounds.

The project includes the liaison with the EPSRC National Centre for III-V Technologies (See LOS) and IQE, global leader in the design and manufacture of advanced semiconductor wafer products (see LOS), to set the procedures for epitaxial analysis and upscaling of the growth conditions defined with the MBE-LEEM. We will also collaborate with Warwick University, to study the epitaxial dynamics of MnAs and the possibility of stabilizing the half metallic phase of this compound. The collaboration between the Welsh government, Cardiff University and IQE has crystallized in the creation of the Institute for Compound Semiconductors, which will enable us to rapidly transfer the growth conditions defined by real-time in-situ monitoring in the MBE-LEEM to industrial MBE systems. Development of an IP portfolio on the nanoscale control of epitaxial processes will be carried out in collaboration with University College Cardiff Consultants Limited. IQE has committed to provide advice, training and materials (see letter of support), providing a unique opportunity for PhD students.

During this project the MBE-LEEM system will be developed and its capabilities demonstrated obtaining preliminary data that will serve to fuel further research projects and encourage collaboration. An important component of the project will be to communicate the new possibilities of the system to the III-V community.

The wide range of potential collaborations with academic and industrial partners offers a unique opportunity for development of future researchers, engineers and technologists, who will have a unique perspective of the field, while participating in research involving theoretical studies, basic research, experiment design, hands-on work on thin film growth and microscopy, and industrial development of III-V semiconductors. The unique capabilities of the MBE-LEEM also provide them with an exceptional opportunity to publish in high impact journals such as Science, Nature or Physical Review Letters.

The plans include significant effort in outreach activities, to disseminate our results, but also to reach to the public and obtain attention on III-Vs research, show how important semiconductors are in everyday life and the benefits that UKs III-V research can provide. The efforts include the collaboration with 3rd and 4th year students to build physics demos and show them in scientific events, and the editing of videos showing research results and their potential implications to society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>112627</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P023452/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
