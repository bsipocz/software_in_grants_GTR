communities with strong religious/cultural identities have sometimes found it hard to engage with or be welcomed into an inclusive British citizenship (McGhee, 2005); some feel there is little sense of one national identity or of a citizenship which comfortably embraces Europe, and that an inclusive citizenship and more participatory democracy is needed (Ofsted, 2006).These concerns and anxiety about political engagement with the state have prompted changes in education policy; Concern about youth alienation from democratic processes has led, at least in part, to the introduction of citizenship education in schools. This has stemmed, in part, from angst about the low levels of voter participation by young citizens in the 18-24 age bracket, in particular. (MacFarlane, 2005).This move to promote a sense of British citizenship has had limited success. The intentions for citizenship education are contested and unclear; its delivery often makes little reference to significant local and national issues and in many schools provision is inadequate. Teachers find it problematic to teach; attainment is generally poor; and its curriculum is ambiguous, incoherent and unmanageable (Ofsted, 2006). There has been criticism that citizenship education is the worst taught subject in secondary schools (Independent, 2006) and it remains fragile in many (Chief Inspectors Report, 2008).The legacy of colonialism, the growth of a multicultural UK and the emergence of trans-national political structures have increased concerns about entitlement to and the nature of British citizenship. International tensions are increasingly reflected in local communities. Particular anxieties have been raised about the disengagement and marginalisation of groups such as Muslims (Osler &amp;amp; Starkey, 2003), heightened by economic globalisation, international terrorism and high-profile extremist events. Media reports can compound concerns, as with young Muslims' reported views on the desirability of Sharia law (Daily Mail, 2007), but fears of the radicalisation and disengagement of some minorities are not reflected in public opinion surveys (Gallup, 2009). There is a growing view that citizenship education needs to be more about empowerment and 'performativity' (Braidotti, 1994) and less about academic content, duties, government institutions, 'the rule of law' (Ofsted, 2006) or the coercion of social compliance seen elsewhere (Martin &amp;amp; Feng, 2006). This project allows young people to explore, develop and practice citizenship in a safe environment reflecting real-world contexts dealing with issues relevant to them in a pluralistic democracy through novel use of an immersive virtual technology they find appealing (Second Life). Evidence suggests that ICT can change long-held, deep-rooted views (Martin &amp;amp; Vallance, 2008) and that immersive environments can be effective in developing self-perception and identity (Bers, 2001).This research uses an imaginative, practical, engaging solution to develop and study citizenship identity. It will identify what motivates individuals to engage with citizenship education; promote more engagement with public and political life; encourage debate and understanding of the concerns and values of others; and promote greater social inclusion.Educational institutions will use the project's work to benefit teaching of citizenship, politics and general studies and increase young people's engagement with political concepts and issues. The research will promote social cohesion by promoting cultural understanding and more empathy for others and more engagement with democratic processes. It will contribute knowledge of how young people understand citizenship and how more engagement with citizenship education may be developed. Research in education, psychology, sociology and computing will benefit from learning how innovative technology can be used to study values, identity and citizenship.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Benefiting will be local community, minority, immigrant and faith groups and political representatives. Researchers and the wider research community will also gain, as will City Learning Centres (CLCs), schools, teachers, students, parents and the university. Faith groups will benefit from greater awareness of how faith and cultural heritage support civil society. The project will benefit CLCs and teachers in using technology and via early access to its outcomes and artefacts. The project has the potential to impact on national culture by increasing awareness of shared values, of how individuals see themselves and the impact of culture and belief on self-identity. It has potential to promote empathy with others and better management of intolerance. Greater understanding of how cultural values and heritage contribute to group and individual identity may help bring about an inclusive 'Britishness'. Politicians and community representatives will benefit from learning how individuals understand and relate to community, politics and values and how these influence identity and citizenship. The research team will gain skills that can be applied in future work in mixed-methods research using innovative techniques. The wider research community especially in computing, sociology and psychology will gain insights into how immersive technology offers new ways to study citizenship identity. Policy makers will gain from seeing how social policy is articulated in civil society, how it shapes citizenship and from more understanding of individual rights and responsibilities in framing citizenship identity. Participants will gain more awareness of relationships between personal responsibility and engagement with political issues in a participatory democracy. Schools will benefit from teacher skill development and in embedding technology within their curriculum. Teachers will gain expertise in teaching citizenship, improved ICT skills, experience of new approaches to learning and teaching and more resources. Students will gain enjoyment, more engaging citizenship education, personal growth and more understanding of and empathy with others. They will also gain awareness of the importance of political engagement and tolerance within a pluralistic democracy. Parents will receive additional support for inducting young people into adult life. The university will benefit from engagement with schools in the region and the contribution to its 'Enterprise' agenda of the commercial potential of software artefacts developed in this project. To ensure tangible benefit, CLCs, schools, teachers, pupils, the university, university students and the project research team will influence the project's work via its steering group and regular meetings or by influencing the environment design, functionality or curriculum support resources. They will benefit from early access to project outcomes, the integration of the project with curriculum delivery, and from a fully functioning resource available to participating schools and local charities at the project's conclusion. Participants will also benefit from opportunities provided for critical reflection on the process of participating and on the issues raised. Communication and engagement to ensure benefit is gained will include public dissemination sessions and a travelling exhibition about the project's work. Politicians, local officers and faith representatives will be invited to join the project steering group and academic and general publications (from refereed journals to local newspapers) will help engage a wider audience. A university website portal and an international conference on the educational use of immersive technologies being organised by the principal investigator will extend communication, as will publications in a special edition of the 'Journal of Computer Assisted Learning' and online conference Proceedings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46654</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Future University Hakodate</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:description>Virtual worlds and experiential learning</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D22897C-5B47-45EA-87E1-D11EDF7DB5AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Award - Comparison of educational posibilities, advantages and implications of using immersive virtual worlds in the UK and Japanese school curriculum.

Data is being collected in line with the project's ongoing study of identity and citizenship within virtual environments. Teachers are gaining experience of how to use virtual environments and immersive educational experiences to develop their use of ICT and also to modify their established professional practice to include not just technology but also more experiential learning. As a result of the interest sparked by the projects work, other schools and colleges are joining the project and the intention is to continue to widen this group to a national study.

More students expressed an interest in both my own research (and came to visit the university to see the project's work there) and in going to university themselves after their formal education has completed. It was clear that their interest in higher education was sparked by the project's innovative work and this has whetted their appetite for further education, which some of them had previously thought of as uninteresting. The schools involved have also confirmed that their pupils are also now taking significantly more interest in science and technology and also in how subjects in general are taught, or can be taught in more engaging and interesting ways. Schools have also reported that teachers have become more technology literate as result of being involved in the project, have used technology more (and in more interesting ways) and some have said that they feel this has had a positive affect on their government Ofsted reports for the innovative use of technology in teaching and learning.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b608205b909.51182216</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Hull</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>5354FA86-42EE-472D-8724-B6BC3349842E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545e49535c7d84.68671330</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project is ongoing and so the findings are expected to continue to develop. So far the outputs from the project have been used to:

Enhance the effective use of ICTs in mainstream schools involved to provide teachers with skills in technology use;

To change the existing pedagogy within schools involved, especially with regard to technology use, but also with regard to moving away from a 'top down' delivery approach to one where experiential learning was more strongly featured.

Schools report that as a result of engaging with the project's outputs and resources pupils become significantly and increasingly more aware of the relevance and importance of participatory democratic citizenship for them and feel more skilled and confident in engaging with the pressing social and political issues of our time.

They also report that students and educators become more skilled in the use of ICT in general and develop a more reflective and critical perspective on its benefits and limitations - examples given include the thoughtfulness with which students now approach events such as the Snowden revelations and recent international political developments and the rise in ideological extremism, the way they are more aware of the nuances within complex issues surrounding the need for individual privacy, data encryption, the desire of states to conduct surveillance for various purposes and the role played within these areas by transglobal corporations (e.g. tensions between Apple and the FBI over whether iPhones are to be unlocked).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6119CA05-9EDD-4B9B-AA50-1A7A444CD63C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b8c05955726.46046717</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>WHAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED

The project developed a highly modified version of an immersive virtual environment generated by a computer and similar to those now often seen in video games, where a realistic-looking geographical 'space' exists to be explored. The environment included terrain to be explored and featured a town where dwellings could be designed, built and furnished and a 'debating space' where formal or informal discussions could be held. The environment also included a range of incidental animations and sound effects to suggest a realistic setting, such as weather, wind effects, resident wildlife, etc.

Within this environment young people played the role of an imaginary character that existed and moved in the created environment (an 'avatar') alongside others created by other young people at the same time. Each avatar could have its appearance customised in terms of its ethnicity, gender and attire so as to reflect the characteristics of any of the main cultural and religious heritages within the UK today, or a mixture of these or none at all.

Young people were then asked to build and furnish a 'home' for their avatar to represent the values, activities and objects that were of most importance to them as real people in the physical world in their daily lives. Periodically avatars would be summoned to the debating area for group meetings. These meetings would be presented with typical scenarios taken from the mass media (TV news and newspapers) that were about topical and contentious issues of citizenship identity, such as gay (or arranged) marriage, the voting rights of prisoners, limitations to rights of protest, different cultural or religious views about family life, justice and human rights and so on. They were asked to discuss each scenario and say what they thought should be done to resolve any conflicts or inappropriate behaviour, or address any issues that were felt to conflict with 'being British'.

During these discussions, the environment offered young people the option to attach particular cultural, religious or moral 'values' to their statements, to show why they believed their comments should be taken seriously by others. Their comments and values (and their definitions of each 'value') were visible to all others taking part in the debates. Groups working together in the environment were asked to try to achieve a consensus view for each scenario.

Young people completed questionnaires about their cultural and religious attachments and took part in interviews about their experiences in the virtual environment and their thoughts about what they had learned and the implications of this for them. Their views were also sought about the value of using of such environments for learning.
The project is ongoing and so the findings are expected to continue to develop. So far the outputs from the project have been used to:

Extend and significantly develop the impact of citizenship education in UK schools

Enhance the effective use of ICTs in mainstream schools involved to provide teachers with skills in technology use

To change the existing pedagogy within schools involved, especially with regard to technology use, but also with regard to moving away from a 'top down' delivery approach to one featuring more experiential learning

To create professional practice that has been praised by the government's Ofsted inspectors

To raise the awareness of young people (especially those approaching the age at which they may vote) of the ethical and moral nuances of citizenship-realted issues and in particular those normally associates=d with particular cultural or religious elements in society 

WHAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED
What has been discovered by this research is that the young people who have taken part in this study to date (over 450, roughly equal numbers of male and female aged between 14 and 19, from a mixture of different religious and cultural backgrounds):

1. Do not generally hold views about 'Britishness' or common moral and ethical standpoints that are derived from or heavily influenced by any particular cultural or religious affiliation.

2. Do feel that social norms and acceptable behaviours within society should be judged primarily on the basis of humanistic values of 'goodness', 'fairness', 'kindness', 'consideration for others', and the prevention of unnecessary or gratuitous harm to other living things.

3. Do not subscribe to radical values, are not sympathetic towards those who advocate extremist religious or cultural practices, irrespective of their own personal attachments (if any) to a particular cultural heritage or religion and associate extremist practices with feelings of revulsion and fear.

4. Found the virtual environment highly attractive as a means of learning about things and enjoyed the immersive experience much more that their usual technology use or experiences in more traditional citizenship-type lessons.

5. The appropriate use of technology can be a powerful way to explore, understand and influence the religious, cultural and humanistsic values, beliefs and understandings of individuals.

6. The current project's specialist use of technology appears to be a powerful means of educating individuals to be more aware of religious and culturally extremist and radical views and appears to encourage a more critical and unaccepting attitude towards these.

It is also clear from this research that with the exception of a few enthusiasts, the educators who have been involved in the study so far (over 40, mostly males working in secondary education or FE colleges) make limited use of digital technology as part of their teaching and that this has little to do with the possession of specialist expertise or training, which most teachers who were involved felt should not be necessary and for which they had no time and little interest in acquiring.

Frequently these teachers pointed out the ease of use and lack of training needed to use social networking, media consumption, online purchasing and the internet as examples of the kind of well-designed 'easy' technology that is needed by schools.

All the teachers who have been involved found the technology motivated and engaged their students and that there was much more informed subsequent learning and engagement of young people with regard to citizenship-related, moral and ethical issues. They also felt that the young people involved had become more socially involved and were now more interested in social and political events and were therefore more likely become politically and socially engaged in such things as voluntary work and voting in general elections.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Repeating similar experiments to establish how generalisable these findings are with regard to moral and ethical issues and 'Britishness'

2. Broadening the application of the use of virtual worlds into other subject areas to determine whether such applications offer greater benefits that more traditional and established ways of learning and teaching

3. Engaging more educators with the present project and subsequent developments of its approach that are planned for future extensions of thee work to create a national data set.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AABD34D3-23FD-4F25-A9A2-0D0365FCA98E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cb0ddd6ae72.99887825</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Changes in schools pedagogy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>000F8A7E-B9EF-4AA0-A37A-1FA228755D2E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Young people in the schools involved in the study have shown increased tolerance and understanding for the views of others from different cultural or religious backgrounds. Teachers have found that the project has sparked a more critical and thoughtful consideration of complex social issues in their students, who they say are now much less likely to be influenced by extremist views and to be more thoughtful in their ideas about how societal problems could and should be resolved. As a result of their engagement in the project, schools have reported that their pupils (and some teachers) are now more likely to engage in democratic processes and to vote in general elections. The project's use of innovative technology applications has also demonstrated that its use can bring about changes to educational policy and practice within schools and colleges and create more effective solutions to societal problems where, for example, the established approaches to teaching 'citizenship' have been found to be largely ineffective.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b63485f8185.45561785</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Immersive virtual worlds for the capture of experiential data</gtr:description><gtr:id>064E0522-4A3B-48B3-8175-4EAFCB799349</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Please see the section on research tools for details of this.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b663a358818.13859300</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Please see the section on research tools</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>An immersive virtual environment is used to create experiential learning scenarios that would be very difficult or too contentious to generate in the physical world and uses avatars to give psychological 'distance' to participants engaging with psychologically sensitive or 'dangerous' topics.

Data is therefore able to be collected about scenarios and feelings and values that are otherwise extremely difficult to obtain and data (and its collection) are made more secure, reliable and valid.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4582BAEC-3D66-488B-8B8E-86ECA9073386</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following the approach I have developed, colleagues at Future University in Japan are using customised virtual worlds, experiential learning and the data collection instruments I have developed to study the teaching of robotics programming and develop resources for both the emergency services and for university students in disaster management.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b65b37913a7.34640103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The use of purpose-built immersive virtual environments for research and data collection</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>UNITY - a programming tool for creating immersive virtual environments.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EDC83385-5AB3-4373-AB45-29F9D07026F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The highly customisable software allows for the creation of physics engines that allow representations of the natural world that closely approximate reality and approach levels more usually seen in the production values used in the mass media (e.g. films). Other, earlier technologies and commercial products (Second Life, Habbo Hotel, etc.) were of limited use for research because they did not allow design and data handling freedoms that UNITY offers because the latter was designed for the video games industry.
What allows the current development/use to be significant is the combination of purpose built research environments and the addition of intensive data collection in real time. As well as offering opportunities for the use of traditional data collection instruments my application of UNITY also allows for continuous monitoring of all activity and for the embedding of data extraction devices that are minimally invasive within the participant's ongoing experience. This has to date been a significant stumbling block for research into behaviour, cognition and emotion, which has often had to break the sense of use engagement/experience in order to collect data, or has had to rely of retrospective or post-hoc strategies with questionable validity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b690eee2b37.68550461</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Immersive virtual environments</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E7F53A32-23B1-46DB-BF51-D1834053B308</gtr:id><gtr:title>Measuring flow experience in an immersive virtual environment for collaborative learning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Computer Assisted Learning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9474358ad612c5466bd3590cdba90618"><gtr:id>9474358ad612c5466bd3590cdba90618</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van Schaik P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b4d644f9cd8.21254586</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4DBBF709-4F74-48B1-AB91-7AE0569C4C02</gtr:id><gtr:title>Invited Editor, Special Edition on Virtual Worlds</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Virtual and Personal Learning Environments</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c42bae12161e0347e6cbda482ef28801"><gtr:id>c42bae12161e0347e6cbda482ef28801</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545e4c80d4e091.43467463</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H043047/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>8B4BFD6F-E6A9-4927-BF01-46F93F5D59CE</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/H043047/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>194966.22</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2012-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>FC78DF94-9EE1-4652-B04A-25560DEDBEC7</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/H043047/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>46654.53</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
