These model organisms are easily maintained, have short breeding cycles and can be modified genetically. The list of model organisms is getting longer and includes baker's yeast, the laboratory mouse and species of nematode worm, fruit fly, fish and plants. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages but all have contributed, and continue to contribute, to our better understanding of the basis of human health and disease. The scientific name of the nematode worm used for many years as a model animal is Caenorhabditis elegans although it is more commonly referred to as the 'worm' and researchers who work with it are known as 'worm workers'. By using C. elegans as a model animal worm workers have discovered a number of highly conserved key biological processes. Two of the more notable include 1) apoptosis, the mechanism used by cells to orchestrate their own suicide in a controlled manner that doesn't adversely affect surrounding, healthy cells, and 2) microRNAs, a more recent discovery about how small RNA molecules control aspects of gene expression. However, unlike yeast or mouse, it is not possible for worm workers to make changes easily to the sequence of the DNA in the worm genome, that is the chromosomal DNA containing all the worm's genes. A number of possible methods are being investigated but, as yet, none has proved reliable and/or effective. The lack of such a 'gene-targeting' method represents a significant absence in the methods toolbox available to worm workers and, as such, it's development is highly sought-after. We will investigate whether a genetic engineering method, developed originally to work in bacteria and termed recombineering, can be adapted to function in a similar fashion inside the worm to change the sequence of the animal's genome. We will use short synthetic regions of DNA, known as oligonucleotides, to direct the desired changes to the genome sequence and proteins known as recombinases that can bind these to the animals' genome. The changes we have planned will make the worms able to grow at a temperature at which non-targeted worms die and so we should be able to identify worms carrying the genome change by growing them at this higher temperature. All animals are able to repair their DNA that has, in some way, become damaged. As our attempts to artificially change the sequence of the worm's genome will likely be recognised as a form of DNA damage we will investigate whether, by inhibiting this DNA repair mechanism, we can improve the efficiency of our gene-targeting method. To do this we will use RNA interference, itself first discovered and developed as a tool in C. elegans, to briefly deplete the associated DNA repair proteins and examine the effect upon gene-targeting. If our gene-targeting method can be made to work effectively we will have produced a technique that will be of use to many hundreds of worm workers and would undoubtedly reveal much more of what makes the worm work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will develop a novel gene-targeting (GT) protocol for C. elegans based upon recombineering. Developed to operate within E. coli, this genetic engineering technique harnesses phage recombinases, e.g. the synaptase Beta &amp;amp; exonuclease Exo of lambda, to mediate HR between a linear donor DNA &amp;amp; a target, e.g. the chromosome or a large episome. Although either double-strand DNA (dsDNA), e.g. PCR products, or single-strand DNA, e.g. oligonucleotides (ODNs), can be incorporated, targeting efficiencies are significantly higher with ODNs. Recently, it has become clear that many dsDNA viruses encode functionally equivalent synaptase &amp;amp; exonuclease recombinases - termed SynExo pairs. Recent evidence from two independent labs indicates that phage recombinases can function in mammalian cells as well as E. coli &amp;amp; may thus form the basis of a new GT approach. We will explore whether phage, or equivalent viral systems, can mediate HR in C. elegans to drive ODN-mediated targeted modification of the genome. In vitro transcribed mRNAs, encoding SynExo pairs from phage lambda &amp;amp; Herpes Simplex &amp;amp; Autographa californica virus will be injected into adult hermaphrodite gonads to mediate their transient, controlled expression in syncitial nuclei. ODNs, ~80nt in length, designed to target a genomic locus will be injected either concomitantly or subsequently. For these proof-of-principle experiments we will attempt to reverse several temperature-sensitive mutant alleles that each mediate a highly penetrant embryonic lethal phenotype. Injections, in appropriate homozygous strains, of mRNA(s) &amp;amp; ODN combinations will be performed at the permissive temperature &amp;amp; diagnostic PCR used to determine targeting success in any resulting lines viable at the higher, non-permissive temperature. We plan to increase targeting efficiencies so successfully targeted lines can be identified by PCR alone, without the need for selection, thus creating a generally applicable method for any locus.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234911</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E016669/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
