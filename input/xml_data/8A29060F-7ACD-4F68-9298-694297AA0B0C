They were crucial for the ground-breaking research that led to 20 Nobel prizes in Physics, Chemistry and Medicine, most recently for the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI - P. Mansfield, 2003 Nobel Prize for Medicine) and for research on graphene (A. Geim and K.S. Novoselov, 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics), and will continue to underpin future scientific and technological developments by providing a powerful means of understanding and manipulating matter. 

This research is constantly refreshed by the discovery of new systems and requires magnetic field strengths that exceed those commonly available in University laboratories. Since the length scale associated with a magnetic field is inversely proportional to the square root of the field strength, large magnetic fields, on the order of 100 Tesla, are needed to probe nanometre length scales, electron-electron interactions, confinement and magnetic energies, and facilitating the discovery of new states of matter. The complexity of the physics involved in cutting-edge materials also necessitates the use of advanced characterization techniques, the execution of high-field experiments with high spatial and energy resolution over a wide range of temperatures down to millikelvin, or in complex environments, such as high-pressure, and the association of high magnetic fields with large instruments, such as neutron sources, synchrotrons, and free electron lasers. 

The membership of the UK to the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL) will enable the UK community to access a well-established mid-range facility for research with high magnetic fields, to develop new capabilities and to secure the direct involvement of the UK in long-term, large scale projects that require international cooperation, for example by integrating high magnetic fields with neutron and synchrotron sources for which a large user community exists in the UK. The synergy of the EMFL with other large-scale international facilities is unprecedented and has the potential to bring the UK to the forefront of important scientific and technological developments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>&amp;quot;UK leadership in key scientific areas&amp;quot; 
Access to high magnetic fields will accelerate progress towards major scientific breakthroughs and will provide a platform to support further expansion of several research areas amongst academic and industrial groups on the 5-10 year timescale and beyond. The increased collaboration and harmonization of the work within the EMFL has already led to the establishment of a strong and competitive community of high magnetic fields within Europe. The current UK access to the EMFL and the wide range of research activities on high magnetic fields indicate that there will be a continuous fast development of both science and technologies over the next two decades. Globally the USA is still dominant in this field because of its concentrated efforts in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Los Alamos and Gainesville. A coordinated approach within Europe is now required to remain competitive, stimulate innovation and the economy. This will be further facilitated by the EU's Horizon 2020 that has identified high magnetic fields as a priority area. As competition from other countries increases, international cooperation with the EU is a must for the UK to remain a competitive partner and to be able to remain an attractive location for carrying out research and innovation.

&amp;quot;Transformational impact on technology, and benefits for the UK economy and society&amp;quot; 
Several UK-based companies (Cryogenic Limited, Oxford Instruments plc, Siemens Magnet Technology, Agilent Technologies, Hitachi, Toshiba, e2v technologies etc.) will benefit from establishing a permanent forum to share knowledge and expertise with the UK users. UK laboratories were among the first in the world to develop technologies to build superconducting magnets, which are now used in MRI systems in every hospital. The technology advances that make possible the construction of high field magnets will facilitate the construction of cheaper and more efficient magnets. Also, research on the magnetic properties of technologically-relevant materials, such as high-temperature superconductors, and on magnet design and construction can have substantial economic benefits. For example, electric motors and generators could operate with improved efficiency and electric power could be transmitted over long distances more efficiently. The infrastructure and installation needed to create these high fields are unique and companies involved will benefit from the knowhow they gain by designing products for them. 

&amp;quot;Skills and training&amp;quot; 
The training and expertise of numerous post-doctoral researchers and PhD students will be enhanced through their access to high magnetic fields, high precision measurements, new experimental techniques, and new magnet technologies. Student training will fill several skills gaps including superconductivity and magnetism, materials and devices, materials for next generation electronics, and quantum information. This cohort will provide a highly significant impact through the availability of research staff to support the UK economy over the next decade.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76061</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>High magnetic fields form part of the fabric of industrial innovation, contributing in three distinct ways: (i) they are often involved in the very early stages of research into new technological materials, (ii) they can be used to change or improve a material's properties, and (iii) the technological challenges raised in attaining an operational high field installations invariably stimulate technical development programs in a number of related sectors. The issues above are explained in more detail below.

1. New materials at an early stage 
High field laboratories serve as an excellent antenna for the discovery of new phenomena in nascent materials whose quality, when first synthesized, is often limited. It took over twenty years, for example, before the combination of high purity single crystals and high-resolution experiments at magnetic field facilities enabled the seminal discovery of quantum oscillations in high temperature superconductors. The involvement of the EMFL in the early stages of graphene research is another important example. Graphene is now on course to become one of the most important materials of the 21st Century, a material with a seemingly endless list of striking physical properties and a flagship enterprise for the whole of the EU, with the National Graphene Institute in Manchester as a striking example. Indeed, the EMFL is currently working closely with a SME in Nijmegen to use high magnetic fields to test the mobility of individual graphene sheets for their use in gas sensors. The socio-economic impact of high field science is therefore clearly evident. However, the time span between the first high-field experiments and the launch of a new product on the market is often more than 10 years. This large time span means that the link between the first groundbreaking experiments on a new material or device performed in a high field facility and its commercialization is often not recognized. Usually, new materials of potential industrial impact are studied in these facilities by scientists from institutes and universities and the outcome of these experiments is published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, from which moment on it becomes available to the public and industry.

2. Improve material's properties 
In addition to the exploration of new materials, high magnetic fields can also be employed to modify the properties of an existing material. A striking example of this is the electromagnetic forming done on metallic systems at the pulsed magnetic field facilities around the world. The strong time dependence in a short, intense magnetic pulse generates remarkably strong magnetic forces that can deform sheet metals into the required shape or even drive holes through it. In some cases, this also leads to an increase in the material's strength, or elastic modulus. To improve the industrial production of razor blades, a study was performed to investigate the influence of very strong magnetic fields on the isothermal formation kinetics of the (ferromagnetic) martensite phase in a (paramagnetic) stainless steel microstructure at constant temperatures around 230 K, to harden blades of Sandvik NanoflexTM, a steel alloy used for surgical knives and razors. The martensite phase transition takes 1-2 days at 230 K in the absence of an applied magnetic field. In fields of order 30 T, however, the process was found to speed up dramatically, taking just a few seconds to complete. In Grenoble (LNCMI) the Swiss watch-company Omega has been successfully testing the effects of high magnetic fields on its products.

3. Technological breakthroughs through development of high magnetic fields 
The magnets available in the EMFL facilities are designed to generate the highest fields and operate at the limits of their mechanical strength. To be able to generate such high fields a dedicated power supply and cooling system are required to operate the in-house designed magnets. The requirements for the magnets and the installation are close to the technical limits. For industry it is technologically challenging to improve their products to meet the demands of both the facilities (power supply, cooling installation) and magnet technology groups (CuAg alloys, Zylon&amp;reg;, superconductors etc). EMFL works therefore closely with industry and industrial suppliers. In many cases, this interaction has led to a number of additional benefits for the companies concerned.

4. Industry as a supplier 
The world-record capacitor bank of the HLD-Dresden is placed by the company Rheinmetall. From the beginning onwards they have been strongly involved in the construction of the capacitor bank. It is a technological challenge to store and release 50MJ in a few milliseconds in a safe way. 
The HFML-Nijmegen state-of-the-art cooling system was realized by the company Wolter &amp;amp; Dros which has put this project on their reference list. The project management, the design of the cooling installation and the building were all realized in collaboration with Royal Haskoning, an international engineering company based in Nijmegen. This collaboration has been very fruitful and has served as a reference project for that company too, strengthening relations between industry and academia. Again, the experience gained with advanced cooling systems by Royal Haskoning through the work done for the HFML has been beneficial in acquiring new markets and clients.
A major upgrade of the Grenoble (LNCMI) 24 MW power supply is currently being realised by the French electrotechnical company BASIS. In particular the targeted stability of better than 10 ppm represents a major breakthrough in high power engineering.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A22EE77A-25EC-47BE-9825-BDB6AFC0F9FC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ab3cfadcadc3.88254668</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The increased collaboration and harmonization of the work within the EMFL has led to the establishment of a strong and competitive community working with high magnetic fields within the UK. Research in high magnetic fields is multidisciplinary, merging concepts from physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. The UK community includes scientists working in the fields of magnetism, superconductivity, semiconductors, strongly correlated systems, topological insulators, graphene, organic electronics, who make use of a wide range of experimental techniques such as thermal and electrical transport, thermodynamic characterization, magnetization, optical spectroscopy, and magnetic resonance. Since September 2015, about 30 scientists from several UK Universities have accessed the high magnetic field installations of the EMFL. This has led to several publications, including an article in Science: J.R. Wallbank, D. Ghazaryan, A. Misra, Y. Cao, J.S. Tu, B.A. Piot, M. Potemski, S. Pezzini, S. Wiedmann, U. Zeitler, T.L.M.

Science 353 (2016), 6299.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>EMFL has several communication medias to reach its target group, including a webpage, newsletters, brochures, flyers, an annual report and banners. EMFL publishes a quarterly newsletter EMFLNews, with the latest developments and scientific highlights. It is circulated both internally and externally to inform the public and the user community. Since the UK community has joined the EMFL, the EPSRC logo also appears on the EMFLNews. The flyers serve to attract and inform new user groups. The brochures and the annual report are aimed more at the policy makers and the general public. Besides these events, EMFL facilities also organise many facility tours to show their installations and to inspire children, students and members of the general public who are interested in science. The EMFL facilities are often present in the news, but not specifically in the UK.
