diterpenoids</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/M018180/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Plants produce a wide range of diterpenoids, many of which are used commercially such as a paclitaxel, employed in the treatment of cancers, and steviol glyclosides which are used as zero-calorie natural sweeteners. Many other useful diterpenoids cannot yet be commercially exploited due to their limited availability and/or high production costs. Using synthetic biology it is now possible to engineer organisms such as yeast so that they are able to convert simple sugars to high-value chemicals. This project will develop yeast, algae and higher plant species as &amp;quot;chassis organisms&amp;quot; which can be used for the scalable production of diterpenoids. Our project will focus in particular on compounds which could be used in the treatment of cancers, or used in skin products such as sunscreens to protect skin against harmful UV light. These biological production systems will also be useful in producing many other diterpenoids that are found in nature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The project will address issues of supply and high production costs of selected high value chemicals of particular interest to its industrial partners (GSK, Unilever and Croda) and will provide advances in technology for wider applications across UK research and industry. 

Currently a number of plant diterpenoids are used in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, food additive and fragrance industries. These are sourced from a limited number of species, restricting their supply and greatly increasing their cost. Using synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, the project will develop new production systems for high value diterpenoids by exploiting recent gene-based discoveries and novel platforms developed by the academic partner laboratories. 

The aim of this project is to develop scalable heterologous production systems for diterpenoids. First, &amp;quot;chassis organisms&amp;quot; will be constructed that can supply elevated levels of the common diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Genes for secondary metabolism will then be introduced into these chassis to create strains producing specific target compounds. We will then scale up laboratory production processes to pilot scale (eg 100 litre fermenter) and develop processes for the purification of the target compounds. Although we will focus primarily on specific diterpenoids of interest to the industrial partners within our consortium, the GGPP producing chassis will be universal in that they could also be adapted to produce a wider range of diterpenoids of interest to the pharmaceutical, personal care, food, fragrance and agricultural industries.

The overall team has a very good balance of 'push and pull' and is well placed academically, technically and commercially to deliver a high impact project for the IB Catalyst.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As described in proposal submitted to TSB</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>530057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Promoting algae for industrial biotechnology</gtr:description><gtr:id>59B27D21-B04E-4534-B6B1-AAFD285F6812</gtr:id><gtr:impact>sLoLa

About half the participants were from industry (including large multisector, SMEs and startups)and 10% or so policy makers and officials eg from EU. The aim was to inform this group about the potential of synthetic biology in developing algal industrial biotechnology, providing the impetus to consider algae as production platforms for high value products as well as simply for biomass production. As a result, a consortium has been formed of academic colleagues who will share best practice and resources in SynBio.

I also described our recently opened Algal Innovation Centre (AIC), where it is possible to carry out pilot-scale algal cultivation, including of GM algae.
