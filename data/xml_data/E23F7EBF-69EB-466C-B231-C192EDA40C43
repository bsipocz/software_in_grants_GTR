Recent upsurges in claims for asylum in Europe, and the increasing need for sustained action from Northern European states, thus places the wellbeing of refugee women as a central concern in this region. This study examines social conditions and support for women seeking asylum in three varying case study politico-economies, namely liberal/neoliberal (Britain), liberal (Denmark) and social democratic (Sweden). It aims to investigate state and organisational responses in these three Northern European states to a) understand socially harmful policy and practice in asylum systems from a gendered perspective and b) develop strategies and recommendations so that such conditions can be mitigated, support improved upon and knowledge shared. Drawing together an intersectional feminist perspective with a social harm framework, this project will address gaps in recognising the micro-level impacts of structural political decisions affecting women seeking asylum. Building on her extensive experience of researching asylum, and utilising connections with governmental and non-governmental organisations in this field, the PI is the ideal candidate to develop research evidence to shape and inform policy and recommendations for best practice in responding to, and supporting, women seeking asylum. 

Since Hillyard and Tombs first outlined a social harm perspective in 2004, social harm remains empirically, methodologically and theoretically under-developed, particularly in terms of understanding women's experiences of harm. Pemberton (2015) extends the perspective via cross-national quantitative analyses of harm within a politico-economic framework, identifying liberal and neoliberal states as those within which harm is most manifest. However, there remain significant gaps in investigating and understanding the scale, nature and distribution of social harm, not least in terms of the gendered impacts of factors which have can result in physical, psychological, cultural, economic and social harms against women. Although Pemberton's quantitative analysis has drawn social harm research further into the empirical sphere of social sciences, the everyday impacts of structural and political decisions have not yet been explored. An intersectional feminist perspective, which recognises that multiple identities in women's lives can mean multiple oppressions, allows for a timely and nuanced way of examining and addressing the continuum of harms that women seeking asylum can face. 

This research thus aims to:
1. Address the current shortfalls and gaps in knowledge by expanding empirically generated data pertaining to the micro-level socially harmful impacts resulting from gendered asylum policy with specific reference to physical/mental harms, autonomy harms and relational harms;
2. Situate the experiences of women seeking asylum in the context of nation-specific historical trajectories, and consider ways in which three asylum systems (Britain, Denmark and Sweden) alleviate or exacerbate physical/mental, relational and autonomy harms;
3. Identify what forms of support are available to women seeking asylum, and address ways in which best practice and policy can be disaggregated;
4. Develop policy recommendations for governmental and non-governmental organisations working with women seeking asylum;
5. Create the basis for a novel, sustainable, and long term research agenda around such issues.

Three methodologies will be employed: critical analysis of policies and legislation; 15-20 semi-structured practitioner interviews per country with relevant governmental and non-governmental representatives; approximately 3-5 oral histories with women seeking asylum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The social significance, interdisciplinary nature and international scope of this project are central aspects of creating and sustaining societal impact. The PI is currently involved in activist, practitioner and academic networks which will facilitate broad national and global knowledge distribution including the Rape Crisis network, Sahir House asylum HIV support, the Border Crossing Observatory, the European Group for the Study of Deviance and Social Control, the Danish Institute Against Torture, and Migrant Artists Mutual Aid. User groups will be included at all stages, from initial networking through to qualitative research and knowledge exchange. Impact will specifically be generated in the followings ways:

1. Women who participate in oral histories will have the opportunity to voice their knowledge of, and concerns around, seeking asylum. The in-depth nature of oral history means that each woman's experiences will be central to knowledge production. From the PI's experience, this encourages self-determination over each woman's own story;
2. Knowledge Exchange workshops will provide a platform for women seeking asylum in Britain, Denmark and Sweden to discuss issues with relevant organisations, such as the British, Danish and Swedish Refugee Councils, and government representatives;
3. Practitioners supporting survivors of sexual violence will benefit from the focus on asylum. As a Director at a regional Rape Crisis (RC), the PI has well established links that will maximise distribution of findings and recommendations. This will be welcomed by the RC network, which often works to full capacity and so gains from information from broader sources;
4. National and Pan-European policymakers from government and non-governmental organisations will gain insight from the varying case study analyses which will provide an in-depth knowledge base of policy and legislation relating to gender and asylum. This will then feed forward to developing policy, or indeed in updating gender guidelines for responding to women's asylum claims in Britain, Denmark, Sweden and further afield;
5. Local authorities from the cities in this study will benefit from region-specific knowledge. This will be shared through local and national networks including City of Sanctuary (UK), Trampoline House (Denmark) and The Swedish Network of Refugee Support Groups; 
6. The PI has established working relations with the Danish Institute Against Torture, Freedom from Torture and the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims. These are national and global organisations working to rehabilitate torture survivors which will benefit from this study's focus on gendered experiences of sexual violence and torture, aspects often overlooked in the context of torture support. These organisations will also be invited to contribute to recommendations, giving them platforms for recognition of excellence as well as future development in the area of asylum support;
7. The respective border control agencies for Britain (Border Force), Denmark (Danish Immigration Service) and Sweden (the Swedish Migration Agency) will benefit from case study analysis in their own country, and in accessing recommendations for knowledge exchange and sharing best practice;
8. The final impact output of this project is to encourage civil society to critically engage in understanding the politics of asylum. The unique position of the PI as a lecturer at the Open University allows for the production of a freely accessible online module, taught through the virtual learning environment. 

In the short term, publications will include widely accessible blogs/articles such as 'OpenDemocracy' and 'The Conversation', and The Guardian's 'Comment is Free'. Overall, at least two journal articles will be published alongside a monograph, and a report will be and freely accessible for service users and practitioners, the summary of which will be published in Arabic, Chinese, French and Urdu.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>105327</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N016718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E420B429-253A-4597-91E9-199D86682755</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
