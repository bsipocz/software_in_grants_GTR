Through its long-term and deep engagement with migrant communities in eight locations: two cities (Glasgow and Aberdeen) two medium-sized towns (Peterhead and Arbroath) and four more remote rural locations in Aberdeenshire and Angus, the project will deliver significant new and original empirical data. It will generate important new academic insight through its innovative synthesis of existing theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the project proposes to develop practical and policy outcomes and solutions through the use of participatory action research. A first phase of in-depth qualitative research will identify key themes and areas of concern, drawing particularly on migrants? own experiences and perspectives. This will be followed by the phase of participatory action research, during which the project team will work directly with migrants, migrant organisations, policymakers, service providers and employers to develop practical projects addressing particular issues. The process of developing these projects will be evaluated as will their short, medium and long-term outcomes with a view to determining 'best practice' and the potential for replication in broader local, regional and national contexts.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will be of interest to and bring direct benefits for a wide range of users, primarily from the public and third sectors. During the course of the project, partner organisations from local authorities, service providers and the third sector, including migrant networks, will benefit directly from empirical insights into migrants' social security needs and contributions, which will be disseminated in appropriate and accessible forms via the project website, through grey literature, etc. They will also benefit from opportunities for direct involvement in innovative collaborations between sectors and communities and in the development of practical solutions to locally identified issues by means of participatory action research. 

In the third sector the project will be of benefit to migrant associations and community organisations as well as individual migrants, whose direct involvement in the research will provide access to structures influencing policy making and service provision and real opportunities for migrant voices and perspectives to be heard. In the public sector, there will be immediate and direct benefits for local authorities and service providers in the case study areas through the provision of new insight and evidence to enable their work supporting migrant populations. This will contribute to the development of effective policy and practice for facilitating longer-term settlement in ways which are positive for both new migrants and established local populations, in terms of sustainability of local economies, healthy demographic balance and the development of vibrant communities. Project findings will be of use in evaluating and further developing initiatives for policy and practice such as the COSLA strategic migration policy. Moreover, in the medium to long-term policy makers at the levels of local, regional and national government in both Scotland and the UK, will benefit through gaining insight into the lived experiences and perspectives of migrants thus enabling the targeting of policy development and the investment of resources into more effective services and programmes to meet the needs of diverse communities and populations.

Whilst the immediate benefits will be most obviously felt in the fieldwork locations, beyond the life of the project they will provide models for and evaluations of 'best practice' for collaboration bringing together research and practical outcomes involving a range of stakeholders. These will be of interest and benefit to local authorities and public service providers as well as third sector organisations across Scotland and the UK. Whilst in the framework of this project these models for best practice will be applied to issues of migration, social security and settlement, and will be most readily replicated by those working in related fields, there is also potential benefit for public and third sector bodies working in other areas to learn from the project findings and approach. 

There will be longer term and perhaps more indirect benefits for employers in both the commercial private and public sectors who regularly recruit migrant workers, as well as for those in front-line services such as health and education, who engage with migrants and their families on a day to day basis. These users will benefit from the outcomes of more effective policy and practice, the development of which the project will enable as outlined above. 

Research staff working on the project, as well as staff of public and third sector organisations involved with the project and participants in the PAR sets, will gain important transferable employment skills in collaborative team work, problem solving and conflict resolution, communication across diverse constituencies, project management and co-ordination, effective integration of research and practice for impact, skills in writing and oral presentation for diverse audiences and stakeholder groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>906717</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A short film about the week-long Participatory Action Research initiative 'The Make It Happen Cafe'.

Materials for this exhibition were co-produced with project participants and members of the host community. Significant elements of the exhibition developed from the Make it Happen Caf&amp;eacute; in Peterhead in July. 
In addition to the film, series of portraits, and living map, we also displayed 'Objects from Home'. These were everyday objects and souvenirs from Lithuania and Latvia which had been donated by project participants. 
The aim of the exhibition was to enable migrants to represent themselves creatively the way they want to be seen, particularly in contrast to dominant media narratives.
Aberdeenshire Museum Service's aim was to increase visitor numbers from underrepresented groups, particularly the migrant population in Peterhead.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6352A229-7C44-4C0B-9B54-962EFEB71CDB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;In terms of feedback re 'Journeys', the purpose of this exhibition, from Aberdeenshire Council Museums Service's perspective, was to represent Peterhead's Eastern European community. I understand that there has been an Eastern European community in Peterhead for many years, but the Museums Service had not engaged in any projects with this community. 'Journeys' gave this community a voice and a presence within the museum. One of the Curatorial Assistants also engaged with a small group of participants, introducing them to Peterhead's whaling history.
 
FOH staff at the Arbuthnot Museum have observed an increase in Eastern European visitors since the exhibition opened. It could therefore be said that 'Journeys' has put the Arbuthnot Museum on the map for this community. It is hoped that there will be repeat visits from local Eastern Europeans with forthcoming exhibitions and events.
 
Since September 2015, Aberdeenshire Council Museums Service has been without an Education &amp;amp; Access Officer. During this period, school visits to the various Council-run museums throughout Aberdeenshire have declined. Consequently, visitor figures have also declined. Thanks to your involvement in this project, three primary school classes from Peterhead Central School were given the opportunity to experience this exhibition. This, coupled with your evening event, boosted visitor figures for December. During December 2015, there were 109 visitors to the Arbuthnot Museum, but last December there were 314, an increase of 205!&amp;quot; Fiona Clark, Aberdeenshire Museums Service curator.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c00f7f38c1d3.84236938</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Journeys</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gramnet/research/ssamis/initiatives/headline_482303_en.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A promotional film about the first run of the Make It Happen cafe in Angus.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A207722E-36AB-4D2D-B2AD-9E0FF9EC446C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c30214bb0005.19684259</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Make It Happen Angus! film</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>FENIKS.

To whom it may concern

I first met Claire when she attended an event as part of the Choose Peterhead Charrette. A conversation about the outcomes of the public engagement that we had carried out, and the unmet needs of Peterhead's Eastern European communities led to the creation of the Make it Happen Caf&amp;eacute; a few short weeks later.

In Claire Needler and SSAMIS we found a partner that shared our concerns in trying to create an equality of opportunities and a genuine social integration of the Eastern European communities, but also a partner who was interested in creative and proactive ways of making things happen.

This has led to a longer term collaboration, collaborating to run a a weekly language caf&amp;eacute;, and actively planning further and future events.

The SSAMIS research and support was instrumental in demonstrating the need for these activities and Claire continues to be a passionate and committed advocate. The combination of academic underpinning with a very people centred and creative approach is inspiring and infectious.

Please let me know if you require any further information.


Yours faithfully

Report on the impact of partnership working between the Workers' Educational Association and SSAMIS

Clare Harper - Educational Development Manager, WEA, NE Scotland
&amp;quot;The WEA has had a very positive experience of working in partnership with the SSAMIS project.
The WEA has delivered ESOL provision in the NE of Scotland for a number of years - mainly focussed on the workplace language needs of incoming EU migrant workers, particularly in the Peterhead area, where many Eastern Europeans are employed within fish processing and related industries.

 It has long been our experience that language training alone cannot meet the needs of incoming workers and their families; the wider process of integration, and raising shared cultural awareness between the local community and ESOL learners is hugely important. SSAMIS has recognised this also, and it is identified within their report.
In order to try to aid integration, and encourage shared learning (and fun activities!) between the 'host' community and 'incomers' - both SSAMIS and the WEA saw the huge potential of language cafes. To this end, Claire Needler and the WEA convened a meeting of people involved in 3 language cafes in Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City, to share experience, look at comparative practice, and identify possible areas for future collaboration. (e.g. possible joint funding applications). This meeting was felt to be useful and valuable by all those attending , and another one is scheduled in the short term. 
In addition, Claire has worked with a WEA ESOL tutor to progress and develop the Peterhead language Caf&amp;eacute; - which has been hugely successful in providing a meaningful and fun learning experience for all those involved - whatever their culture and country of origin.
If the WEA in this area has the funds, it will be more than happy to continue to support this partnership initiative with SSAMIS.
It has proved enlightening to see the process of academic research actively informing shared development in a local area.

I hope this collaboration will continue.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c013b265cfb9.18798824-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Modo contribute the venue, staff time, and publicity and promotion.

The SSAMIS research and support was instrumental in demonstrating the need for these activities and Claire continues to be a passionate and committed advocate. The combination of academic underpinning with a very people centred and creative approach is inspiring and infectious.

To whom it may concern

I first met Claire when she attended an event as part of the Choose Peterhead Charrette. A conversation about the outcomes of the public engagement that we had carried out, and the unmet needs of Peterhead's Eastern European communities led to the creation of the Make it Happen Caf&amp;eacute; a few short weeks later.

In Claire Needler and SSAMIS we found a partner that shared our concerns in trying to create an equality of opportunities and a genuine social integration of the Eastern European communities, but also a partner who was interested in creative and proactive ways of making things happen.

This has led to a longer term collaboration, collaborating to run a a weekly language caf&amp;eacute;, and actively planning further and future events.

Report on the impact of partnership working between the Workers' Educational Association and SSAMIS

Clare Harper - Educational Development Manager, WEA, NE Scotland
&amp;quot;The WEA has had a very positive experience of working in partnership with the SSAMIS project.
The WEA has delivered ESOL provision in the NE of Scotland for a number of years - mainly focussed on the workplace language needs of incoming EU migrant workers, particularly in the Peterhead area, where many Eastern Europeans are employed within fish processing and related industries.

 It has long been our experience that language training alone cannot meet the needs of incoming workers and their families; the wider process of integration, and raising shared cultural awareness between the local community and ESOL learners is hugely important. SSAMIS has recognised this also, and it is identified within their report.
In order to try to aid integration, and encourage shared learning (and fun activities!) between the 'host' community and 'incomers' - both SSAMIS and the WEA saw the huge potential of language cafes. To this end, Claire Needler and the WEA convened a meeting of people involved in 3 language cafes in Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City, to share experience, look at comparative practice, and identify possible areas for future collaboration. (e.g. possible joint funding applications). This meeting was felt to be useful and valuable by all those attending , and another one is scheduled in the short term. 
In addition, Claire has worked with a WEA ESOL tutor to progress and develop the Peterhead language Caf&amp;eacute; - which has been hugely successful in providing a meaningful and fun learning experience for all those involved - whatever their culture and country of origin.
If the WEA in this area has the funds, it will be more than happy to continue to support this partnership initiative with SSAMIS.
It has proved enlightening to see the process of academic research actively informing shared development in a local area.

I hope this collaboration will continue.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c013b265cfb9.18798824-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Modo contribute the venue, staff time, and publicity and promotion.

This idea received an overwhelmingly positive response with most participants stating this was a good idea and worth pursuing, and that such a space was very much needed in Angus. Moreover, the ESOL students taking part in our consultation event considered being given the opportunity to meet and speak to other people from the community as one of its greatest benefits. Following the consultation Paulina formed a Steering Group for the Angus Community Cafe. She also successfully applied for funding for running pop-up cafes to trial the idea from the ESRC Impact Acceleration Account.

A better understanding of the differences between the Central European and Scottish education systems was reported, and a number of participants were interested in future co-operation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2ef93339c22.83084315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gramnet/research/ssamis/outputs/outputs/#/workingpapersandpresentations</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog Post, Policy Scotland Welfare Reform Blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A88D418A-14A1-416A-8771-0F76E86DF489</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited blog post on the SSAMIS project linked to the launch of Policy Scotland's Welfare Reform Network in late 2015.

We wished visitors to the station to engage with the question 'What it is like to live in Scotland for people from Central and Eastern Europe, Russia or the Former Soviet Union?' and 'What is it that makes people choose to come here and what helps them to decide to stay?' 
The research station combined a variety of interactive materials and examples gathered through our research, including: objects, art work and photographs we have been curating and creating with migrants living and working in Angus and Aberdeenshire; a film showing our language cafe initiative in Peterhead; and the reports we have produced. We asked visitors to be involved in a number of interactive activities including: to help to create a 'living map' by adding a polaroid photo and their story of migration to the map; to add to our interactive phrasebook with languages that they knew; to respond to the question 'what makes a place home' and 'what would you say to people coming to Glasgow'. We also talked to people about our organised community initiatives and events, language caf&amp;eacute;s;our research findings and future events we were organising. 
Through the day we had between 50 and 100 people coming to the stall, getting involved in the activities, and talking to us about our research findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd34931c0439.26414690</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gramnet/research/ssamis/disseminationevents/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Celebrating the Difference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>778111DF-055A-4B2F-8088-F44FB409C268</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Claire Needler displayed information at a community open day 'Celebrating the Difference' in the college NESCOL in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire.

The initiative came into being as a response to the issues of loneliness, isolation and barriers to language learning that our study participants had voiced. Through this initiative, we are trialling the idea of a community cafe in Angus that would provide a family-friendly space for people from various communities to come together. 'Make It Happen Angus!' started with a series of 30 events and activities organised for and with the local community in Arbroath between 4th and 16th October 2016. Following the success of the initial run of Make It Happen, Paulina has continued with the pop-up cafes. The cafe has been attended by around 250 people so far, its popularity and support for it is growing. Our cafe participants have commented that this is a very good idea and have appreciated the welcoming and inclusive atmosphere of the cafe. There are plans of the initiative to be taken over by a local charity in the making, Multicultural Angus Charity, after Paulina's role in the initiative comes to an end (Paulina is also one of the trustees for this new charity). Another legacy of Make It Happen activities is Angus Council starting a new daytime family ESOL class in the same venue as Paulina's pop-up cafes (OB's Cafe, 19 West Port, Arbroath). The venue is a former cafe (which has now been shut down for a few years) belonging to a local church trust. Until recently, the venue was scarcely used and largely forgotten; Make It Happen activities have put it back on the map for the local community and made it a known space to the migrant community.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2f266a5b196.36034186</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gramnet/research/ssamis/initiatives/headline_483501_en.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Living and Working Together in Scotland: Lessons for Policy and Practice</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A86E04C-D45B-4186-8FE2-61684E59738B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was organised in collaboration between SSAMIS, GREC and CPAG in Scotland and brought together research findings and recommendations from projects undertaken with, by and about migrant communities in Scotland. It focused on supporting the development of evidence-based practice and was opened by the Chief Executive of Aberdeen City Council who pledged to work with the organisers and participants to take the outcomes of the day further in developing a strategic policy approach.

Discussions during the event itself concluded by identifying two priority actions that would make the biggest difference in improving policy and practice going forward. 
These were:
? A strong consensus on the need for co-production of knowledge and working across sectors in terms of policy development. This included a call for community engagement in both policy development and implementation and the need for bottom-up responses; 
? A call for greater transparency and accountability in terms of policy which is needs driven and informed by evidence. This should also entail flexibility and willingness to change policy if evidence suggests it is not working.
 
These priorities will be taken forward during a roundtable event, to take place on 7th June 2017, where the focus will be on looking at actual policy mechanisms and practical support to further these priorities. The Chief Executive of Aberdeen City Council has committed to host this roundtable. We are actively seeking opportunities to extend this discussion to include Aberdeenshire Council.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b81d0755d309.73988720</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gramnet/research/ssamis/disseminationevents/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Migrants in the Welfare Reform workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>565B4BBD-8C82-4772-A695-B035B3490CE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation: 'Engaging with the welfare system in Scotland: Central and Eastern European migrants' experiences' at the Supporting Migrants in Welfare Reform workshop, Glasgow, 11th November 2015.

The event began with presentations from Henri Krishna (CPAG Scotland), Dr Holly Porteous (SSAMIS team) and Dr Paulina Trevena (SSAMIS team)
After the presentations, the audience were organised into discussion groups. Each group included a mix of representatives from academic, third sector and policy organisations. Discussions began with the opportunity for participants to use their own experience/work/research to build on, further illustrate, or offer alternative perspectives to what was said by the speakers.
The groups went on to talk about what could be done in practical terms to better support migrants, and how to support those providing services or support to migrants in navigating welfare and welfare reforms. Summaries of the discussions have been published on the Policy Scotland website. These include suggestions for roles which specific organisations and groups could take in better supporting migrants and welfare services with which they engage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b33e17596349.00995044</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://policyscotland.gla.ac.uk/supporting-migrants-in-welfare-reform-next-steps/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Migrant Youth Identity workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6CA4CEED-21EF-4B9E-BFD0-120DCAFAB7F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation: 'Young Polish migrants in the UK: local contexts, work, friendships and de-/re-constructing identities' at workshop 'Migrant youth identity in post-referendum Scotland', Scottish Universities Insight Institute, University of Strathclyde, 19th October 2015.

Comments and likes also allow participants to have a say in the ways in which initiatives develop over time and in some cases to take further ownership of for example language cafe programmes, offering to run particular events or activities etc. Our main Facebook page has 121 followers, but dedicated local pages/events linked to the language cafe in Peterhead has 83 followers and to the community cafe in Angus 42 followers.
Our twitter feed also reflects our participatory activities but is more tailored for practitioners and researchers and also reports on related research or current affairs stories.

Our Participatory Action Research phase has been very much focused on delivering impacts in localities linked to the research but also developing models for wider development of policy and practice. This is reflected in entries regarding partnerships and collaborations, further funding, engagement activities, influence on policy and practice and artistic and creative products.
These initiatives are aimed at benefiting society and the economy in a number of ways.
The language focused initiatives stem specifically from our project findings that despite a high value placed by migrants on improving their English language skills, especially for those in rural areas, opportunities to do so effectively are very limited even where they have been in Scotland for several years. Opportunities to improve language have also been found by the project to have important knock on effects for local communities in terms of improved integration and for local economies in terms of more effective use of migrants skills and employability. The language cafes are addressing these issues in very practical and locally grounded ways, and have developed a model which is now being taken up more widely, for example through the sharing lives, sharing languages peer education project, through the impact on Workers Educational Association approach to language provision in Aberdeenshire etc.
The community development initiatives also have potential benefits for migrants and for the wider local communities where they live. Feelings of isolation and loneliness have been highlighted in the study as significant factors for a number of migrants limiting their opportunity to engage more positively in local society and economy. Local authorities have expressed concern regarding the need for better engagement with migrants in their areas. 

Over the last 12 months, our initiatives have helped to raise awareness of migrant lives and experiences, provide opportunities for greater interaction between migrants and others in their local community (especially in small town, rural contexts) and improve opportunities for engagement between local authorities/service providers and migrant residents/service users. In both Aberdeenshire and Angus effective partnership working with other locally based community development organisations (notably Modo in Peterhead, and Angus Refugee Care in Arbroath) is making a tangible difference to these issues. The community cafe in Arbroath provides a regular, welcoming and friendly space for different parts of the community (long-term CEE migrants, recently arrived Syrian families, members of the established local community) to come together and share activities, make friends and conversation, engage in arts and craft based activities. These are also feeding into the development of local exhibitions which raise broader awareness of the diverse local community and in Peterhead have resulted in a significant increase in visits to the museum and its engagement with the CEE people living in the area.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>39F3022E-3872-4737-BC77-EAFCC53C36BF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bc9fef3c9526.83244530</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In-depth interviews with 207 migrants and 65 stakeholders/experts in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Angus and Aberdeenshire offer detailed insight into the complex experiences of migration and settlement from CEE/FSU to a range of rural/urban contexts in Scotland. Key findings to-date include: 
Experiences of migration and settlement are open-ended and shaped by a multiplicity of factors. Location (urban/rural), access to and experiences of housing and accommodation, employment experiences and negotiation of relationships within the family and with wider communities all play a highly significant role. Employment is a key motivation for migration. However, experiences of employment are very mixed and migrants are often employed in lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs, especially in rural areas. Many migrants work in contexts where the majority, if not all co-workers, and indeed supervisors are CEE migrants. This does not always change over time. The role of employers can be crucial in positive/negative experiences for migrants and in decisions regarding settlement. Patterns of housing varied across the research locations and forms of employment. Neighbourhoods also played a significant role in migrants' experiences and their opportunities for wider social integration (or not). Social housing was viewed largely very positively and created opportunities for 'home making' although placement in areas of high social deprivation could be problematic from both sides. Experiences of welfare, benefits and rights are very mixed. Migrants do not always have full or accurate information about services and rights. Migrants tend to have strong views on entitlement and deservingness with regard to benefit and welfare entitlements and are more likely to claim in-work benefits, whilst often holding negative opinions of those who 'depend' on benefits, whether migrants or long-term residents. Family and close social networks emerged throughout the study as a key factor in people's lives. For many people family connections prompted migration and played a central role in decisions about where to migrate to and how long to stay for. Negotiating relationships with other family members, both those who had also migrated to Scotland and those still living in the country of origin (or elsewhere) took considerable time and energy and brought both material and emotional costs and benefits. Families played a central role in negotiating questions of care, both for children and for elderly family members and in managing financial issues. For those with children, issues relating to schooling and educational opportunities were also very important. Language skills and knowledge of English are generally highly valued and migrants frequently express a desire to improve their English language skills. However, especially for those in rural areas, opportunities to do so effectively are very limited even where they have been in Scotland for several years. A significant sub-set of migrants have (re)acquired other CEE languages (Russian/Polish) often to facilitate communication with co-workers and supervisors. Migrants' closest friendships are often with fellow migrants, and tend to be limited to a small number of trusted friends. There is limited contact between migrants and local communities, especially in rural areas and social isolation and loneliness are considerable issues for many migrants.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Feedback from policy makers and practitioners (in both the public and third sectors) at local, regional and national (Scotland) levels indicates that are using the findings in their work, for example as evidence for campaigns to change policy and practice at local, regional and national levels.
