There are now around 11,000 charities that work internationally. This includes many of the well-known larger charities, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Christian Aid, but also a large number of smaller organisations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to provide, for the first time, an overview of the charitable connections between the UK and overseas, including:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Global patterns in charities? country of operation:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>where do UK registered charities work overseas?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How does this compare to the country pattern of Official Development Assistance (ODA) provided by government?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;Local patterns in overseas charitable connections:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>can particularly strong links between places in the UK and particular overseas countries be identified?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Empirical context on the overseas charitable sector: of those charities working overseas, how many are involved in development and relief? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What roles do they play?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To what extent has there been a growth in the number of voluntary organisations working overseas?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project will use publicly available data from the Charity Commission to answer these questions.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit a variety of groups:

- Country-level patterns in charitable operation will benefit the voluntary sector by providing individual charities with the information needed to place their international activity within a wider context. This may form part of a suite of information which informs decisions about country priorities. Note that in the charity's latest annual report the Chair of Christian Aid, Dame Anne Owers, argued that 'Christian Aid and the wider development community have big decisions to make about where we work, and how'.

- The findings will also be relevant to government. Knowledge of patterns in overseas charitable operation will complement information on bilateral patterns in Official Development Assistance (ODA), providing a new understanding of the relative role of UK official and voluntary aid in particular countries overseas. 

- Comparisons of the UK country pattern of ODA and the UK country pattern of charitable operation will feed into wider discussion within the development community about the role of philanthropy in development. Note that the recent Bellagio initiative - developed by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Institute of Development Studies and the Resource Alliance to consider the future of philanthropy and development - concluded there was 'a lack of sufficient understanding of the different comparative advantages and complementarities between different types of actors'. 

- Individual donations for international development have increased markedly over the last couple of decades. Therefore, interested members of the public may be curious to learn about the nature of the UK's international philanthropic connections - both in terms of the country patterns in operation of charities, and in terms of trends over time in the number of charities working overseas.

- Documenting the data available on patterns of country operation, and expenditure within these countries, will provide a long-term resource for data user communities spanning government, the voluntary sector and the increasing numbers of data users among the public. In particular, the project would aim to learn from, and contribute to, the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), which seeks to improve the access to, and quality and comparability of, data on aid, including that provided by NGOs. 

- Throughout, the project would seek to promote an enduring conversation between researchers, government and the voluntary sector - both about what we know about patterns in charitable operation at the moment, and what we might like to know in future. This would feed into conversations with the Charity Commission about the utility of collecting this information in the future, and how it might best be approached.

Overall, the project aims to provide a first solid baseline of analysis in an area that is likely to become even more prominent - with aid high on the political agenda; with international charities growing in size; with an increasingly internationally-engaged public; and with data resources that are likely to continue to improve.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139495</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog on the international operation of charities working overseas</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3D19473F-CBE6-47D4-8813-3C955180E6C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To clearly communicate research results in non-technical language suitable for a non-academic audience</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5839d9961fadf6.38785663</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blog.journals.cambridge.org/2016/03/08/where-do-english-and-welsh-charities-operate-overseas/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Voluntary Sector Network/ National Council for Voluntary Organisations conference (Sheffield)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3C44F13F-FF75-4F95-A470-98BE3F789295</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk to Voluntary Sector Network/ NCVO conference, a national conference for researchers, practitioners and organisations interested in the third sector.

For example, in 2014 the data collated and analysed by the project was shared with BOND, the umbrella body of UK development NGOs. In 2014 BOND was involved with information-sharing and coordination activities for UK NGOs working in Ebola-affected countries, and contingency planning for those in the neighbouring 15 countries that WHO identified as potentially at risk. The project provided BOND with a database of charitable organisations with experience of working in these countries, which helped BOND to reach out and make contact with the appropriate organisations and individuals.

The project also provided advice for a report commissioned by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Global Health. The APPG report, 'The UK's Contribution to Health Globally', was the first attempt to map the UK footprint in improving global health - encompassing the full range of activities from the public, private and voluntary sectors. The project liaised with Nadeem Hasan, who authored the report, to provide advice and information about the newly available data on international charities. This has led to new knowledge about the scale of work undertaken by UK NGOs to improve health globally.

The project's longitudinal research has also provided new understanding about trends in the income of charitable organisations - relevant to policy debates about, and prominent public concern over, the impact of recession and austerity on the voluntary sector. This has provided unique insights into the challenges experienced by charities during a period of unprecedented change for voluntary organisations. The evidence has been submitted to the 2016 inquiry launched by the House of Lords Select Committee on Charities. This inquiry, which is examining the nature of the pressures currently being faced by charities, will make recommendations to the UK Government about how best to promote the sustainability of the charitable sector.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9D35298C-9029-49C3-B97C-761E91326596</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545517034f3cf0.18124495</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has provided new empirical evidence about English and Welsh charities operating internationally. 

First, it describes in detail where English and Welsh charities operate overseas. It illustrates considerable unevenness in charities' countries of operation, even after taking into account countries' population size and level of poverty. It shows that, compared to other countries, English and Welsh charities are less likely to work in overseas countries with low levels of governance (countries considered the least politically stable; those where corruption is considered to be least under control); much more likely to work in countries with historical connections to the UK (countries that formed part of the British Empire; those where many people have moved after birth to currently reside in England and Wales; those where English is an official or common spoken language); and much more likely to work in countries that are priorities for UK government aid (those identified as a 'focus' country in the 2011 bilateral aid review). 

Second, it documents a sizeable increase since the mid-1990s in the number of charities working overseas. While international civil society is not new, and has been facilitated by technological improvements for hundreds of years, these results reflect the continuing processes of integration that bring together the lives of people and places in different parts of the world. Notably, the results show a particularly significant increase in the number of small organisations - which points to the growing importance of small-scale 'grassroots' international voluntary organisations.

Third, the project serves to provide a new perspective on international charitable operation: while it is the large development charities that are household names, the results reveal the extent of small-scale 'grassroots' registered charitable activity that links people and places internationally, and the extent of activity in 'developed' as well as 'developing' country contexts. This perspective was made possible through the analysis of a unique administrative dataset, provided by the Charity Commission, which records every country in which each registered charity operates. In doing so the project illustrates the new opportunities for empirical research made possible by the increasing availability of administrative data on voluntary organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The academic research will be made available through open access publication, signposted by an accessible blog. Given the high profile of international voluntary organisations - and the significant charitable donations to international causes - members of the public, as well as academic researchers, may be interested to learn more about the nature of international charitable activity. 

Continued engagement with umbrella bodies for the voluntary sector will seek to ensure that established development charities, together with the wider population of 16,500 voluntary organisations and the associated trustees, will benefit from the information needed to place their international activity within a wider context.

The files prepared during the paper's analysis, including a file for each of the countries considered with details of every registered charity working there, are being made available to users through the UK Data Service. They may be of interest, for example, to grant- making bodies looking to fund organisations working in a particular country. They will also provide a basis for information-sharing where there is often limited knowledge about other organisations working in the same country.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4300CD54-F2AD-411B-BCF0-D3E9172AD0C4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddd0ccd65be1.93170651</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Provision of training on use of administrative data on the third sector - collaborating with the Administrative Data Research Network. 22 June 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D959C2B-7963-4B6F-854F-4768AA0BC49F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df6ddfdcb1e4.07287587</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>These data provide information on the countries of overseas operation of registered charities in England and Wales.
