&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>1991 2 per cent Individual SAR - UK&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>1991 1 per cent Household SAR - UK&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>2001 5 per cent Small Area Microdata file - UK&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>In addition the team at the University of Manchester is working with ONS to support more detailed files currently available only within national statistical offices. &lt;br />Our programme of work will include the following components:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Providing access to data through a variety of media and in a variety of formats.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Support and a reduced level of training for users including a helpdesk service and a participation in workshops.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>The promotion of data and provision of information through newsletters and social media.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Monitoring the use of SAR files and their impact.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Working with the Census offices to complete arrangements for 2011 microdata.&lt;/li>

A safeguarded microdata sample of individuals has been identified as a key Census user requirement, and was highlighted as part of a report specifying microdata products from the 2011 Census written by an expert user, Dr. Jo Wathan from the University of Manchester. 

The purpose of a safeguarded sample of individuals is to be able to disseminate a detailed microdata file without onerous licensing conditions, by reducing the overall amount of detail compared to the secure samples. Whilst supplying sufficient detail on core variables to fulfil the intended aim of the microdata products, the safeguarded sample is a valuable multi-purpose research file that will be used on a wide range of projects. (For Censuses prior to 2011, these data may have been referred to as 'Samples of Anonymised Records', or SARSs.)

This safeguarded sample is of 5% of the total population at Grouped Local Authority (LA) level (Scotland), and contains a similar level of detail to the equivalent End User Licence Census 2001 Microdata samples. A similar Scotland dataset at Regional level is held under SN 7834. These samples have a low risk of disclosure; but not nil.
