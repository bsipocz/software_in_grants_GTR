Many of their applications utilise the ability of these particles to stay firmly attached to oil-water interfaces, thus forming particle monolayers. Interfacial particles are partially immersed in both liquids. The water liking particles (called hydrophilic) are largely immersed in the water, while the oil liking ones (called hydrophobic) are mainly immersed in the oil. It was found recently that the behaviour of hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles at the oil-water interface is very different. Hydrophilic particles attract each other making particle rafts. In contrast, the hydrophobic particles strongly repel each other and stay well separated at large distances in ordered arrays. It has been shown that the repulsion between hydrophobic particles is caused by electric charges at their surface in contact with the oil. However, the important questions about the origin of these charges and how they depend on the chemical nature of particles and oil are still open. The situation became even more puzzling after very recent findings which suggested that the same electric charges might be responsible for long range particle attraction. In addition, strange selective attraction between hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles has been observed in their mixed monolayers. Hence, many aspects of the interactions between particles at oil-water interfaces are still controversial and puzzling. One of our aims in this research is to investigate the interactions between solid particles at oil- water interfaces in order to reveal the factors and mechanisms responsible for the surface charge at the particle-oil interface. To clarify these aspects is of significant scientific and practical importance.Solid particles can also attach to the surface of droplets when oil, water and particles are stirred together. The obtained particle-stabilised emulsion can be extremely stable (for years!) because particle armoured droplets cannot merge. This is their best asset which makes these emulsions useful for preparation of durable cosmetics and other products. However, we will not focus on this traditional application of particle-stabilised emulsions. Instead, we will use them as a tool to develop methods for fabrication of novel materials and devices with interesting and useful properties. Our research strategy is based on the following experimental facts: (i) particles are strongly (irreversibly) held at the drop surface staying partially immersed in the drop; (ii) particles can form an incompressible porous membrane around the drops, preserving the droplet area when the drop volume is decreased; (iii) particle stabilised droplets can be firmly connected to each other when some solid particles become simultaneously attached to the surface of two separate droplets. The latter occurs spontaneously in some emulsions. We will take an advantage from these unique features of particle-stabilised emulsions by using them in a non-traditional way in order to develop experimental methods and procedures for fabrication of so-called Janus particles whose two halves have very different properties (for instance hydrophilic and hydrophobic), unusual emulsions with non-spherical shape of their droplets, non-spherical composite solid particles, porous materials with controllable structure and composition, etc.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>477105</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has been contributing towards the competitiveness of the UK as a global leader in manufacturing of advanced materials.

Since the interfacial particles are partially immersed in both liquids, their behaviour is strongly affected by the particle wetting characterised via the particle contact angle (the angle between the solid particle surface and the liquid interface, measured through the water). Hydrophilic particles are better wet by water and have contact angles smaller than 90 deg., while hydrophobic particles are not well wet by water and have contact angles bigger than 90 deg. The direct measurement of the particle contact angles is very difficult due to the small particle size. In this project we have investigated how the wetting of colloidal particles affects their interactions at the oil-water interface and their behaviour in particle-stabilised foams and emulsions. 
One of the main achievements is the development of a novel method for measuring the contact angle of individual small particles in their natural environment in real time. This method differs from the existing techniques by its simplicity, reliability and applicability for measuring the contact angle of very small particles in real time without using sophisticated instruments or complex calculations. Using our method we have obtained the first direct evidence that hydrophilic particles make emulsions of oil droplets in water, while hydrophobic particles make water-in-oil emulsions. We have used the knowledge gained from these studies for developing a new and versatile approach for making highly permeable porous polymers via particle-stabilised emulsion templating. The further development of this approach will allow the synthesis of a novel class of permeable particle reinforced macroporous polymers with a significant potential for practical exploitation.
Our investigations confirmed that the hydrophobic particles strongly repel each other and could stay well separated at large distances in ordered arrays at the oil-water interface. We have studied the structure of mixed monolayers of 'large' (3 micrometre diameter) and small (1 micrometre diameter) very hydrophobic particles at an oil-water interface and for the first time successfully stabilised two-dimensional alloy crystals made from colloidal particles. The variety of crystalline structures obtained were found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations performed by computer simulations. Potential applications of such colloidal structures include surface patterning, photonic band-gap materials and biological and environmental sensors.
Solid colloidal particles having simultaneously two distinct surface regions with hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties were also investigated. We have developed a procedure for producing large amounts of these so-called 'Janus' particles (named after the two-face Roman god Janus) and demonstrated that they behaviour in aqueous and emulsion systems differs from that of the ordinary colloidal particles with homogeneous surface. Such 'Janus' particles could be used as building blocks of novel 'smart' (stimuli-responsive) materials and tunable emulsion stabilisers with potential applications in cosmetics and pharmaceutics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The novel method for measuring particle contact angle can be used by researchers in both academy and industry for characterising wettability of small solid particles thus helping to improve their performance in products with complex composition.
A new and versatile emulsion templating approach for synthesizing highly permeable macroporous polymers can be further developed for making porous materials which can be used as a permeable barrier in oil wells, porous media for chemical and biological separation (e.g. in food industry) or scaffolds for tissue engineering.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6A64A673-8F49-4E57-A0DB-862B795805D2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a63ab389c95.02792974</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://news.cision.com/university-of-hull/r/scientists--pioneering-research-could-lead-to-smart-materials-of-the-future,c9412550</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9A556EA1-61C1-448A-888B-B3E31A97C1E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Comb-like&amp;quot;
