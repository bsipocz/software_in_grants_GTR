People suffering from strokes, heart attacks, arthritis and other diseases could benefit from this strategy. These treatments are dependent upon specialised cells called stem cells. Stem cells are different from other cells in the body as they can form new tissues of any type and current research has shown early success in using stem cells to treat a range of diseases. Unfortunately, however, they are hard to find in the body and are often present in only very small numbers. Due to this, they often require deep surgical sampling, such as within bones, where they are present in higher numbers, and this can be painful and costly. Further, due to the small numbers found, they have to be sent to a laboratory to grow them into sufficient numbers. Growing the cells in the lab is time consuming, costly and has regulatory implications. 

Stem cells hide in the body using tags on their surface, and these tags are also involved in helping stem cells find their way around the body to a site of injury. A new alternative involves giving a medicine to disrupt the tags and free stem cells directly into the blood. This may provide two potential possibilities. Firstly, it may be possible to free enough stem cells into the blood that we can get sufficient numbers of stem cells from a simple blood sample, thus avoiding deep and painful surgery sampling. A further advantage may be that in freeing sufficient stem cells into the blood, they will naturally travel to the site of injury and improve healing, thus avoiding the need for samples to be taken and processed in a laboratory. 

Currently, published work in this area has not comprehensively evaluated the cells liberated nor what happens to them. Are they the same as traditionally sampled stem cells? Can they be successfully grown in the lab and form new tissues? When freed within the body, are they directly involved in forming tissue or do they co-ordinate this process?

Sometimes when people break a bone, there is a problem with it healing. If it does not heal, then further invasive and costly surgery may be needed. However, by using stem cell treatments, we may be able to avoid this and help kick-start the bone to heal itself. The goal of this project is to find out if the stem cells freed into the blood are similar and most importantly, as effective as the traditionally surgically sampled ones in boosting bone healing. We will also determine if stem cells liberated into the blood are able to naturally travel to the injury site and help healing. This will be compared with directly placing stem cells into the broken bone. We will also track the movement of stem cells by giving them a label, so we can trace where they go and try to determine how they are helping the bone to heal. Finally we will determine whether altering the cells to increase the efficiency of their tags may improve their localisation to the broken bone and boost healing further. 

This methodology if successful could enter clinical trials and would significantly decrease the cost burdeon to the NHS and patients discomfort in those people with broken bones that will not heal. Further this methodology could lead to a revolution in regenerative medicine by reducing the costs involved and discomfort suffered by patients receiving these new stem cell treatments, by helping the body to heal itself.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aim: To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological methods of mobilising mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the blood; their ability to home to the fracture, and their potential role in fracture healing; and whether these mechanisms can be genetically exploited to enhance regeneration further. 

Objectives: 1) To determine the most effective protocol to mobilise MSCs in the rat. 2) To determine if mobilised MSCs differ from bone marrow (BM) isolated MSCs. 3) To determine if mobilised MSCs can be used therapeutically and contribute to bone healing, both by innate homing and after extraction and processing. 3) To determine if intentionally increasing the expression of homing signals can further increase fracture localisation and healing.

Methodology: In a rat model, the CXCR4-SDF1 axis, which modulates stem cell migration and homing, will be exploited. AMD3100, a selective antagonist of CXCR4, will be used to mobilise MSCs into the blood. MSCs will be assayed through FACS, plastic adhesion, CFU-F and tri-differentiation and compared with BM isolated MSCs. An established osteotomy model will be used and comparison of local MSC administration to systemic administration will be made. Processed cells will be traced with cytoplasmic highly fluorescent quantum dot (QDot) tracker nanocrystals. We will further exploit MSC homing to damaged tissues where SDF-1 has been shown to be upregulated, by CXCR4 adenoviral transfection of MSCs. Functional healing will be mechanically tested, and tissue regeneration will be assessed through histology, radiography and pQCT. 

Opportunities: This represents a significant change in methodology for implementing stem cell/regenerative medicine therapies. It could have significant cost and patient morbidity savings. As a methodology, mobilising stem cells within the body to augment healing may have clinical benefit beyond the fracture healing model outlined here, to many other diseases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>A significant number of bone defects and fractures do not heal. The NHS sees around 850,000 fractures each year with a non-union rate of 5-10%. Treatment can be difficult, requiring multiple interventions, significant morbidity and a large cost to the NHS predicted between &amp;pound;7,000-&amp;pound;79,000 per patient. This research project plans to evaluate and develop a recent advance in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. By pharmacologically mobilising mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the blood they can be obtained by simple blood sample and avoid the cost and morbidity of deep surgical aspirates, prior to laboratory processing. A further potential development is the possibility of using a pharmacological agent to free MSCs into the blood allowing them to naturally migrate to the site of injury, to encourage and enhance fracture healing, avoiding surgical intervention entirely. This work is of international interest and will have a high positive economic impact on the NHS as it would reduce the financial burden associated with revision fracture surgery and will also improve the health and well-being of patients suffering from these conditions. Cell therapy treatment and its effect on bone regeneration will impact and provide benefits in furthering knowledge transfer across many areas of medicine. Interest in the results from this study will be broad and may be translated widely. This new approach will have significant importance and impact for many other areas of stem cell/regenerative medicine therapies where isolation of adult MSCs is required, such as treatment of liver cirrhosis patients, musculoskeletal disease including osteoarthritis, myocardial infarction, and neurological degeneration/damage. Therefore successful treatment using MSCs will stimulate public interest, awareness and increase engagement of the general public within the fields of science and engineering. Following investigation in the rat model, it is our intention for this treatment to be investiged in human clinical trials. Trials in veterinary clinical patients using the same technology, would be effective in providing further supportive data for a human clinical trial. These sorts of breakthroughs can also have significant benefit in terms of increased public awareness and understanding of regenerative medicine, not to mention benefit to patients.

This research project will also have impact in understanding fundamental and applied stem cell biology, specifically aspects of MSC mobilisation, homing, and mechanisms of healing. There is potentially a very large national and international impact for researchers involved in adult MSCs both basic and translational research, as they will find this a simple and cost effective way to easily isolate adult MSCs for their research investigations. The ease of which this methodology could be used to obtain adult human MSCs would allow a significant increase in usage and decrease in costs associated with obtaining MSCs for research. As a research tool for investigating MSCs that avoids utilising embryonic MSCs this may have significant public relations benefits for stem cell researchers. 

The novel approach of genetically engineering MSCs as a means to enhancing certain cell characteristics, could have significant impact in terms of driving a new direction in stem cell biology/therapies; 'Enhanced MSCs' may well unlock increased possibilities for future treatments and for understanding their biological mechanisms, and would prove of great interest to any groups working on adult MSCs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>330051</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N002318/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>DD81206B-5EB4-4BCC-AEF7-808A64606E0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
