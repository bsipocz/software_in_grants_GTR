It is a multidisciplinary, comparative analysis of 'super-diverse' high streets that aims to explore how urban retail economies and spaces are shaped by and shape migrant entrepreneurial practices. The project focuses on five high streets within the UK's most diverse cities including: London, Leicester, Manchester, Birmingham and Bradford. Two questions at the heart of urban life and political debate in the UK provide the project's orientation. The first question - 'What is the future of the British high street?' - has publicly resonated since 2008, as high streets struggle with the aftermath of the global economic recession and a parallel increase in technological innovations in online purchasing. The second question focuses on increasing migration into UK Cities over the past two decades, and extends to how urban concentrations of migrants locate, invest in and transform the economies and spaces of UK cities, in particular its urban high streets. The pertinence of 'the changing nature of the UK high street', and questions of 'social diversity' have been highlighted in recent ESRC research initiatives and investments, but as separate rather than related subjects. This project therefore explores macro societal changes, combining migration and shifts in urban retail economies, through the transformation of micro worlds.
 
In comparing the social, economic and spatial compositions of five high streets in the UK's most diverse cities, the project aims to address empirical and policy gaps in detailed understandings of how contemporary high streets are transformed though urban migration. By focusing on social diversity and urban retail economies the project empirically explores the role of migrant proprietors as part of the UK's high street landscapes, and engages with larger questions of migrant incorporation and urban adaptation. The overarching objective is to define and analyse the 'super-diverse' high street as a complex urban assemblage: to explore connections between the diverse origins and networks of the shop proprietors; their range of retail activities and practices; and the spatial infrastructure that supports and is altered by their endeavours. In developing a comparative evidence base, the research aims to input into policy on high street futures, and to contribute more broadly to understanding how migration transforms our streets and cities. 

Three key questions frame the project:
1. What are the appropriate definitions of a 'super-diverse' high street, and how can the composition of spaces and practices provide an analytic lens on the relationship between the retail activities of a high street its migrant proprietors?
2. What broader lessons can be drawn from the comparison of five super-diverse streets, for understanding the role of migrants in transforming urban space and economy?
3. What methodological aspects of this research are replicable for larger comparative studies of migration and urban change?

Five core aspects of the high street will be explored including: social diversity, retail activity, measures of value, spatial infrastructure and stewardship. The project will commence with a socio-economic survey of the proprietors of each street and will include GIS spatial mapping and data visualisation. Focus group workshops will be held with respective local authorities, traders and local organisations to understand how these streets are organised, managed and imagined. The project will be based at LSE Cities, and national and international collaborations will be developed with the 'High Street Future' centre, the 'Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity', and the 'Global Diversities' unit. Public engagement will be actively sought through seminars with academic, policy and third sector organisations, and project information will be shared through a 'Super-diverse streets' project website.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to engage with the wide public interest in 'the future of the high street' that currently abounds across the UK, by introducing the largely unrecognised role of migration in reshaping street-based retail economies. Through the commonplace notation of the street, the project also aims to interject in more narrow political and public debates on migration, by productively engaging with migration as central to urban landscapes and futures across the UK. The ambition is to produce a systematic evidence base to input into policy, to innovate comparative urban methods by incorporating qualitative and quantitative dimensions and data mapping and visualisation, and to conceptually enrich the emerging research field of urban 'super-diversity'. 
 To fully advance the societal and economic impacts of this research project, the project proposes various platforms of exchange to engage a wide array of users and beneficiaries including: focus group workshops, seminars, an online project site, and publications in both academic and public arena, including where possible, policy recommendations. Further, the project will generate a detailed and comparative database to be publicly available through the ESRC archive. 

Who will benefit from this research and how?
1. Academic sector
The collaborative dimensions of this project are founded in relationships with three leading research centres or units: 'High Street Futures' (University of Southampton), the Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity (University of Manchester) and the 'Global Diversities' unit at the Max Planck Institute. To increase the potential impact of the methodological approach and the research findings, I will meet with these centres at project inception (year 1), project analysis (year 2) and project dissemination (year three stages). I aim to publish three papers in leading academic journals and develop a research monograph proposal to expand the larger empirical and conceptual findings of the project. 

2. Government and Policy sectors
There is a distinct policy and planning gap in understanding the role of migration and migrant economies in the composition of UK high streets specifically and in processes of urban transformation more generally. During the third year of the project, three seminars will be arranged to explore dimensions of street economy, street stewardship and street policy. Each seminar will include academics, policy makers and third sector organisations. More particularly, in the second year of study, interviews and focus group workshops will be conducted by the 'Social Life' social enterprise, with local authorities and proprietors from two of the selected streets, to explore how streets are organised, managed and imagined. Reports will be shared with respective local organisations. I aim to write policy-oriented recommendations for government agencies and/or blogs such as the LSE Policy and Politics blog.

3. Third sector and broader publics
In year two and three of the research I will meet with third sector organisations concerned with the policy and planning of streets, such as the Association of Town Centre Management (ACTM) and the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS). Project findings will be more broadly disseminated, from the second year of the project through the 'Super-diverse streets' online project site within the LSE Cities.net website, where aspects of data visualisation will allow the complexities of the study to reach a broader audience. The LSE Cities website currently attracts 12,000 users per month, of which 6,500 are new users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>217828</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Research in Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship</gtr:department><gtr:description>Ongoing collaboration with the Centre for Research in Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship, University of Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F8A4AEE-10A4-49DF-92DE-0D5C4A49A542</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20th Annual Ethnic Minority Business Conference</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bea4309529a5.36708988-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>1.

1. Broad use of Data Profiles: 
In December 2015 we launched the Phase 1 findings of our research, both via a website: https://lsecities.net/research/data/cr/phase-1-super-diverse-streets-survey-comparisons-2015/en-gb#/, and a set of four clear and accessible data profile reports on 'Ethnicity, Economy and Migration' for each of the four cities studied. these are regularly downloaded from our project website, for use by researchers, the general public, the media, and public officials. 

2. Media engagements:
The research has been used to inform several debates on migration and Brexit across a wide range of media including: 
a) Printed Press: the 'Leicester Mercury' who published an article on 04/02/16, which was subsequently republished by seven other national newspapers including: The Daily Mirror, The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Daily Star, The Metro and the Daily Express, The Financial times. The reports focused on the diverse economic life sustained my migrant retailers in a comparatively deprived part of Leicester. The articles attracted a vast number of comments, some positive, some extremely negative in light of migration politics. 
b) TV: BBC One programme on 'Brexit: Britain: the street with a dozen words for hello'.
c) Internet: Migration Matters education series on 'Six impossible ideas after Brexit'. 

3. Academic research:
The work has begun to be citied in leading journals, I have given numerous keynote and conference presentation nationally and internationally. 

4. Education:
I have presented the research at High Schools jn the UK, and have also been interviewed for a podcast for the Royal Geographical Society education programme.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7268D036-2051-4558-8787-2A2CB369898A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d57b0c774579.11490990</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I am now in year 3 of a three-year research project. In Phase 1 we explored the micro-retail economies established by migrant proprietors in ethnically diverse and comparatively deprived parts of UK Cities. We focused on Rookery Road in Birmingham, Stapleton Road in Bristol, Cheetham Hill in Manchester and Narborough Road in Leicester. We found that these streets are composed of a wide diversity of countries of origin amongst proprietors, and that the varied migrations of these proprietors over time are connected to long-standing and more recent histories of economic and political turbulence across the globe. Each street is significant in terms of jobs generated, and this finding is particularly important in urban contexts where unemployment rates are comparatively high. Many proprietors we surveyed have tertiary levels of education, have been in some other form of work or employment prior to setting up shop, and are proficient in a number of languages, indicating high skill levels amongst shop proprietors. There is also a pattern of twice, thrice plus migrants, showing how migrants frequently have to engage with multiple national border systems. On the street, transaction economies range from fairly standard practices for profit, to practices of social exchange and 'community care' across ethnic groups. This include the emergence of a 'form-filling' economy in relation to advice and expertise on how to engage with local public services and immigration requirements. From our research data, we contend these streets reveal vital urban micro-economies that are under-researched and poorly understood. Details of our findings on the 'Ethnicity, Economy and Migration' of these streets are available in four clear and concise online reports, as well as the website. 

In phase two we focused more on how ethnic minority traders in local high streets are supported, and selected two of our four case studies (Narborough Road in Leicester, and Rookery Road in Birmingham) to conduct interviews and workshops with traders, community groups, council officials and local political representatives. We worked with Social Life in this phase and they developed report, which outlines the following action points for agencies working with street-based retail on super-diverse streets:
. Councils should explicitly recognise the value of ethnically diverse street
based retail and its contribution to local economies, both in formal policies
and strategies, and in the actions and day to day statements of officers and
elected members.
2. Street-based traders' critical issues - including parking and safety - are
core to their businesses. The importance of these needs to be recognised in
planning local schemes. Addressing problems will signal the council's
goodwill and intention to support this group of businesses. Traders often
have workable and practical suggestions about improving the things that
cause frustration, and need avenues to communicate these.
3. It is important that engagement and consultation with traders recognises
the practical difficulties they face attending meetings. Traders are more
likely to engage through informal meetings, either one to one or in small
groups, or through their own networks. They are less likely to take part in
conventional consultation processes like public meetings.
4. Supporting traders to strengthen their informal networks, through social
media or otherwise, is effective and inexpensive. This can use new and
emerging social media platforms that are already being actively used by
traders.
5. Councils need to acknowledge that traders reluctance to invest time in
setting up traders associations is related to the low benefits that they see
these structures generating, as well as the high time commitment needed
to set them up.
6. Bureaucratic and administrative barriers - like ward boundaries or
inflexible contracts - cause frustration. Flexibility about contract
boundaries and break clauses can enable migrant traders' representative
bodies to play a bigger part in managing local areas.
7. Councils should seeks out and collaborate with traders and businesses that
share a social value perspective. They should not under estimate the
extent of community-based support that is being provided through local
initiatives, and could find ways of combining resources to meet shared
goals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. We have developed four detailed datasets on street economies in four diverse and deprived parts of UK cities. these are currently available in data profile reports and are freely available for researchers and public agencies.
2, In the second phase of our research, we engage with how the first phase research may be useful to local authorities, as well as government agencies and civic sector groups engaged in high street retail, independent retail, and more broadly, the role of migration in shaping UK Cities. 
Action points for agencies dealing with street-based retail in super-diverse streets are available in the report produced by Social Life.
