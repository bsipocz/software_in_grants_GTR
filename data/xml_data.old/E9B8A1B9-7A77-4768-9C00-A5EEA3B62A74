These conditions may be characterised by a catastrophic loss of the primary light sensitive cells in the outer retina. Most common are rod-cone dystrophies, where there is initially a loss of peripheral vision followed by a decay of central vision leading to total blindness. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are fast becoming the most prevalent forms of blindness. In AMD central vision is affected, and it is now the commonest cause of blindness in the western world in the over 60's. It is predicted that there will be a significant healthcare crisis as the population is ageing and AMD is prevalent. Sufferers of RP, AMD and DR generally all retain a normal optic apparatus and a viable population of retina ganglion cells that form the optic nerve / the communication superhighway to the visual cortex. These features raise the possibility that clinical prosthetic intervention could bypass the diseased tissue and stimulate the remaining healthy cells, a strategy that avoids the complexities associated with repairing the degenerate retinal tissue Attempts to date in this area have come in two forms: subretinal implants which attempt to stimulate the remaining neural processing layers of the degenerative retina, and epiretinal implants which have attempted to stimulate the retinal ganglion cell layer directly. While there is some progress in these areas, and recently even clinical trials, there are four substantial problems that this technology has yet to fully address:1) Surgical access and biocompatibility2) Long-term efficiency of information transfer from the physical prosthesis to the RGCs, leading to high stimulation current requirements3) The lack of spatial resolution associated with the very low density of electrodes available using current technology4) The inability of the current technologies to approach restoration of near macular function, because of the lack of retinotopic mapping of the afferent ganglion cell bodies in the vicinity of the optic diskOf all these issues the most serious is the energy power consumption required per electrode to stimulate ganglion cells. Required currents can be as high as 2mA meaning that the large pixel arrays required for recreating images would require unfeasible quantities of energy. A recent development that opens the possibility of a new paradigm in vision restoration technology has been the discovery that a small percentage of RGCs (&amp;lt;0.1%) are themselves directly light sensitive. They overcome the problems of light detection in RGCs by employing a novel opsin photopigment that is quite different from rod and cone opsins. The function of these photoreceptive RGCs appears to be the regulation of time-of-day dependent photoresponses such as circadian entrainment rather than generating visual images. More recently there have also been developments in other opsin systems such as channel rhodposin and nanoparticle light stimulation.Mark Hankins has been expressing and characterising melanopsin in neuronal cell lines. In addition Patrick Degenaar has been investigating alternate methods of nanoparticle stimulation which does not involve genetic engineering. This, combined with our experience in the development of intelligent imaging chips and retinal algorithm development, gives us a great opportunity to develop a whole new class of retinal prosthesis. A photostimulation-based prosthesis can be external, not suffer the power problems of electrical stimulation, and be easily tuned and upgraded.Using light to couple an intelligent retinal processing system to the surviving retinal ganglion cells represents an important and significant paradigm shift in field of retinal prosthetics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>346647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A retinal prosthetic device comprises image capture means arranged to capture an image, light producing means arranged to define a plurality of light paths along each of which a light beam can be directed towards a respective position on a retina, and control means arranged to process the captured image and control the light producing means so as to produce a stimulating array of light beams along a group of the light paths, the group being dependent upon the captured image.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>EP/F028539/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>D3103EC7-90CC-4C15-AA83-A411F3B208E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None direct</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>5464c2f7919f73.42558374</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:patentId>US20100152849 A1</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Retinal Prosthetic Devices</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In our part of this project based at Oxford, we employed a post-doctoral researcher (Dr Laurence Brown) who led the melanopsin biology part of the project . The biology of the program sort to:

1. To develop retinal RGC cell lines which stably express both ChR2 and melanopsin light sensitization agents.

5. To use the photostimulation rig to ascertain the biophysics of the ChR2 and melanopsin agents, and collect data on the variance of their expression and the required transfer function for optimal stimulation at lowest energy (light intensity) cost.

6.To use the biophysical results to feedback important information to the development of cell lines with mutant photosensitisation agents to increase response speed and optimise energy consumption.



Dr Brown successfully developed a number of cell lines stably expressing the human melanopsin protein as a cellular light sensitizing agent (Aim 1). These cell lines have allowed us to study the photobiology of light stimulation. Melanopsin light sensitization has proved to have relatively slow kinetics that are significantly below that required to work with the optical platform developed by Patrick Degenaar. As a result of these findings we began the process of optimising the melanopsin protein by generating 6 opsin chimeras that incorporate part of the melanopsin sequence with portions of the rhodopsin protein. These chimeras took a significant time to generate using molecular cloning. Towards the end of the project we generated working chimeras that combined the core structure of rhodopsin together with the intracellular (signalling)surface of melanopsin. This protein works as a functional light sensitizer in a number of cell lines and critically is 63%faster than native melanopsin (In preparation). (Aim 6)

We devoted a significant time in the grant to optimising opsin gene delivery to the retina and this work is critical to using these proteins in the human degenerate eye. We are aiming to optimise gene delivery to specific cellular targets so that they work optimally with the external prosthetic. This work is still in progress in the applicants laboratory and the first publication has just been published: 

You Q, Brown LA, McClements M, Hankins MW, MacLaren RE (2012) Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) significantly increases AAV2/5 transduction of human neuronal cells in vitro. Exp Eye Res 97:148-153.



Consistent with the original aims of the project, we have successfully generated a number of potential clinical light sensitizing proteins based on the structure of human melanopsin. The second round chimera proteins are faster and should work with the developed human prosthetic developed in this program. We have tested these in principal on working stable cell lines and examined the kinetics using whole-cell patch clamp studies (Aim 3). We have risen to the critical challenge to apply these clinically by beginning to optimise the delivery of these proteins to the human retina using AAV-viral vectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Once these strategies have been optimised the proof of principal that these proteins can work with the opto-prosthetic awaits a funded clinical trial. We are still pursuing this work towards a trial in the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology in Oxford.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BB361F7B-97F1-42F4-A71A-9FE19A8E3DAC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8964161788.080038776ef368</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0EAF8495-811B-465E-B345-1BD51D206FC5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Focus on molecules: melanopsin.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental eye research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/017a5be395261b2f88dbe46476115a8a"><gtr:id>017a5be395261b2f88dbe46476115a8a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davies WL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-4835</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5464be4475c984.71038974</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3FED27BC-E523-4C25-8127-3402F33CD2DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) significantly increases AAV2/5 transduction of human neuronal cells in vitro.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental eye research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/16a96a55b793ee8108ee6dea28d647d9"><gtr:id>16a96a55b793ee8108ee6dea28d647d9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>You Q</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-4835</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff3ff33fe1216</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F028539/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
