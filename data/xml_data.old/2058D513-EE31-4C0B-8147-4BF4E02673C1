Globally girls around the world have developed their own personal strategies to cope with menstruation. These vary greatly from country to country, individual's personal preferences, available resources, local traditions and cultural beliefs and knowledge or education. Some of the menstrual practices have been associated with different health outcomes (Bacterial vaginosis and urogenital infections)(9). Across the globe menstruation and its management also have important social and cultural implications which may in turn impact girl's lives. Absence from school, has been of particular interest to International organisations and research bodies working in this area such a WaterAid, the Water Research Commission and Plan International. These organizations report that in their experience girls' absence from school during menstruation can have both physical and psychological causes. A literature review we conducted in 2013 found there was good evidence that educational interventions can improve menstrual hygiene practices and reduce social restrictions but there was no quantitative evidence that improvements in menstrual knowledge and management methods reduce school absenteeism and urogenital infections. This work will contribute to increase the knowledge on the effectiveness of potentially scalable interventions to improve menstrual hygiene management, school attendance of Gambian schoolgirls and reduce urogenital infections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Menstrual hygiene interventions may improve girls' school attendance. A systematic review we conducted in 2013 identified 7 interventions studies of menstrual hygiene education which show some evidence that educational interventions can improve MHM practices and reduce social restrictions but the studies had methodological issues(9). A recent qualitative study we carried out among Gambian schoolgirls showed that girls had a poor knowledge about menstruation and that some of the reasons why they miss school were association with menstrual hygiene management (8). Achieving higher levels of education are correlated to important public health outcomes, including reduction of early pregnancies, risk of HIV infection infant and maternal mortality as well as improvements in the nutritional status of children. The aim of this research will be: 1)to test different methods to measure outcomes and collection of basic epidemiology data, 2)understand the intervention needs of the target population,3)to refine the intervention, 4)to assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention among schoolgirls, parents and teachers.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147030</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Gambia, Republic of the</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Unit, The Gambia</gtr:department><gtr:description>Partnership with MRC Unit The Gambia</gtr:description><gtr:id>90FAC556-35AA-4D9C-87C1-207D4489FAA6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>-Contract agreement.

Helen Nabwera has been working in MRC Gambia for the last 3 years and she has experience in the clinical care of children and adolescents inrural Gambia and Kenya and the use of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess psychococial stressors in rural Gambian female. She will help to coordinate and organize the field work as well as provide her expertise in women and community programmes. She is a co-PI for the study. The Gambian partner is the MRC-Gambia Unit which has a strong record of maternal and child nutrition research. We have involved in our study researchers from other projects that ended in Gambia,who were interested in this new topic and wanted to develop their skills in the social research area.LSHTM with Andrew Prentice leadership and MRC-Gambia have actively collaborated on bothresearch and capacity-strengthening over 20 years. Rita Wegmuller, Head of Station in Keneba, has provided scientific guidance for the study.They had also a sufficient readiness, administrative support and commitment at MRC Gambia to facilitate the achievement of the stated objectives and deliverables.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We approached MRC Unit The Gambia in summer of 2015, when a student went to do her first MSc project in the area of menstrual hygiene. We were very well welcomed as this unit was working in Gambia for the last decades and had a huge record in working in nutrition within the community. The proposed inter-disciplinary school-based feasibility study had the potentil of improving our understanding of the issues involved and lay the groundwork for the main study aiming to reduce school absenteeism and urogenital symptoms and infections among the targeted adolescent girls while strengthening menstrual hygiene management and other issues around puberty. This proposal aim also to help to strengthen MRC Gambia and its partners' capacity in the emerging social science, implementation and policy research in a highly conductive mentoring and enabling south-north partnership.We have conducted training in qualitative and quantitative methods, establish good relationships with the clinic and stablish a good relationship with the data entry team.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We are testing different methods to assess school attendance in the different study schools in Gambia. 
We are using 3 methods:
-Self-reported by questionnaire.

With this methods we would like to assess which ones could be more useful to capture school absenteeism related to menstrual hygiene management issues.</gtr:description><gtr:id>550E057F-D162-4304-875C-B0D58CB0571D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are collecting the data now, we have not have time to analyse or present to the public but we anticipate that these methods will be very useful for further research projects assessing school absenteism related to MHM.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c29bea67a397.92490727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Different tools to measure school attendance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We are collecting a very exhaustive data about different menstrual hygiene practices and knowledge from 400 school adolescent girls.

We are also developing new method to collect data about the stress generated by managing menstruation in girls attending to the study schools.
