This is partly because there has been a dramatic expansion of autism research in the past decade in the UK and abroad (Dawson, 2013). The most comprehensive review of UK autism research ever undertaken recently found that almost &amp;pound;21 million was invested in autism research between 2007 and 2011 by UK government and non-government organisations, spread across 106 different projects (Pellicano et al., 2013). The Economic and Social Research Council made more funding awards than any other organization, while the Medical Research Council awarded more money for autism research than any other funder. 

These developments are to be hugely welcomed. With 1 in every 100 UK people on the autism spectrum, it is vital that we develop our understanding of autism. Greater knowledge of the nature of the condition and its potential impact is clearly of significant social import. The same comprehensive review has also shown, however, that autistics, parents, clinicians and service providers are concerned that the research profile in the UK has largely prioritised basic science, especially biological science, potentially at the expense of other fundamental, but more applied areas, of research, including public services for autistic people, evidence-based treatments for autism and its related symptoms and the social and ethical challenges posed by some of the more recent scientific advances.

This proposed seminar series will bring together some of the world's most celebrated autism scientists with leading experts and practitioners drawn from these other fields in an effort to develop a new research agenda in each area of concern. They will seek to build new networks of inter-disciplinary researchers capable of pursuing this new agenda in the decades to come. 

The seminars will be participatory in nature and begin by posing key provocations or questions that should both stimulate immediate discussion and asist scholars in developing more detailed research questions for the future, in collaboration with community members. 

The seminars on public services would begin with questions including: What are the socioeconomic, ethnic and gender disparities in access to services? How can we improve post-diagnostic support for parents of children with autism and autistic adults? What are the best ways to get autistic adults into work and keep them there? 

The seminars on evidence-based treatments, interventions and educations would begin with: What do we mean by 'evidence' when referring to autism interventions? How do we measure the effectiveness of education programmes in schools who follow 'eclectic' programmes? What 'outcome measures' should we use in interventions and who gets to make these decisions?

The seminars on autism and society would begin with: Should we be aiming for &amp;quot;inclusion&amp;quot; of autistic people in society and, if so, how do we achieve it? What place should the autism community have in shaping the research agenda? How do we know if, when and how we should intervene with autistic children, young people and adults? How should we best promote awareness (and acceptance) of autism?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This seminar series originates from a sense that although UK autism research is world-leading, it has not as yet realised its &amp;quot;translational&amp;quot; potential. In other words, major scientific discoveries have not been translated into recommendations for new services or treatments nor have they been properly and fully examined for their social and ethical implications. Moreover, autistic people and their family members have rarely been actively engaged in the research process - in deciding what the priorities are, how an issue is researched, who undertakes the research and so on - and many people report feeling disenfranchised as a result. These seminars aim to help put all of this right. Enhancing the impact of British autism research, is thus, at the very heart of their purpose.

That effort to enhance impact will be shaped in two ways,

First, those representing the main advocacy organisations and funders (e.g., National Autistic Society, Ambitious about Autism, Research Autism, Autistica, Autism Education Trust, Scottish Autism, Autism Cymru), and members of the autism community, including autistic young people (where appropriate) and adults, family members, and individuals from the policy and practice sectors (those focused on children and adults) will be intimately involved in each stage of the proposed seminars. Representatives of many of these bodies have already been consulted on the proposal and have discussed the ideas directly with the applicants. Should the bid be successful, they will be invited to participate in the seminars and will bring their conclusions directly to their membership. We believe this will stimulate significant and long-lasting interest in the seminars and their subjects.

Second, we will also use the established and extensive networks and resources of the applicants, including the London Centre for Research in Autism and Education (CRAE), to disseminate the results of the seminar discussions and provoke wider discussion and further future research, both academic and non-academic. We will use social media (Twitter, Facebook) to publicise events and to promote a dialogue with those unable to attend (e.g., via 'live tweeting'). Parts of the seminars will be filmed and podcasts posted on the CRAE YouTube channel for wider dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30231</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Services Seminar II</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F8D9538-4D51-4025-A2A3-20C291DC2E71</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The third ESRC-funded seminar in the Shaping Autism Research series took place at Cardiff University on 4th and 5th February 2016.

Half of the seminar attendees were autistic and half were from the broader autism community (researchers, including early-career researchers, practitioners and charitable organisations). As in all of our seminars, there were short talks, panel discussions and creative activities to enable as much discussion as possible between attendees.

The overall goal of the seminar series has been to effect a culture change in the way researchers engage with members of the autistic community and their allies: &amp;quot;shaping autism research&amp;quot;. The purpose of this final seminar was to produce a range of materials that will contribute to this cultural shift and can be carried forward by workshop attendees and everyone else who has been associated with the seminar series so far. 

We hope that a cultural shift in the research community will also influence similar cultural shifts in related communities (e.g. among service providers and practitioners) and will result in better translation of research into practice by virtue of the research having been informed by community priorities in the first place.

But little of this research has concentrated on the everyday needs of autistic people and even less has been shaped directly by autistic people and their families; read more here. Involving community members in research - from the very inception of an idea to research design to implementation and interpretation of findings - is one vital means of ensuring that more of the research that gets done has a direct and sustained impact on those who need it most. The goal of the fourth ESRC-funded Shaping Autism Research seminar, held at University College London on July 18th and 19th 2016, was for researchers to come together with the autism community, including autistic adults, parents of children with autism and practitioners to: 
1. Examine the different ways to conducting participatory research, drawing from such work both inside and outside the field of autism, 
2. Discuss the opportunities and challenges to involving the autistic community in research, and 
3. Determine ways to overcome any such challenges. 
Short talks, panel discussions and creative activities ensured plenty of opportunities for discussion among the attendees.

As the majority of autism research in the UK focuses heavily on &amp;quot;basic science&amp;quot; - neural and cognitive systems, genetics and other risk factors (Pellicano et al., 2014), the goal of this second seminar was to address research that targets the immediate circumstances in which autistic people find themselves in daily life, on services, interventions and education. The first Public Services seminar focused on discussing the development of more effective Health and Social Care services in partnership with the autism community.

They include:

Priority Area 1: Autism Practice

Priority Area 2: Public Services

Priority Area 3: Autism and Society

Each seminar aims to:

*Help initiate world-class research in areas that have been identified as both (i) being currently underserved in the UK and (ii) key priorities for the future by the UK's autism community.

*Create a participatory forum - offline and online - in which autistic people, parents, professionals and advocacy organisations can help shape UK autism research for the future.

*Foster inter-disciplinary and collaborative approaches in order to build new and distinctive research capacity in each of these three priority areas.

*Enable the participation of doctoral and early career researchers, which is essential to expanding the research interests and skills of the next generation of autism researchers.
