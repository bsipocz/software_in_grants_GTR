Evidence is mounting regarding the negative consequences of high inequality for social, well-being and political outcomes, not just for those who find themselves in the lower strata of society, but for countries as a whole (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009). With questions of fairness and distribution high on the agenda and continued debate on how to best address ensure them, there is a noted absence of a long-term perspective on the causes and consequences of inequality.\n\nAn historical perspective on these problems is invaluable in order to assess and understand contemporary patterns of inequality, their origins and consequences. How are inequalities created and reproduced? Can we look beyond market mechanisms to understand how cultural, social and international processes contribute to stratification? How have patterns of inequality changed in the past and what caused them to do so?\n\nTaking an historical perspective on the subject of inequality can make a contribution to current concerns in a number of ways: (a) go beyond diagnosis to explore the variety of processes and mechanisms through which inequalities are created, reproduced and transformed; (b) analyse the short and long-term consequences of inequalities and of interventions designed to alter them, and; (c) by providing evidence that clarifies, qualifies or corrects current research and discussion.\n\nIn recent decades, Historians have tended to shy away from an engagement with the kinds of questions central to the theme of inequality, but an increasing number are returning to these issues and seeking to reach beyond their field and sustain a productive exchange with other disciplines and beyond academia. This network will bring together historians, social scientists, economists, third sector researchers and policy makers concerned who work on the topic of inequality. Through a series of high profile, international events, the Inequality, Social Science and History Research network aims to develop new ways of questioning the subject and contribute to critical contemporary debates.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work of the network will serve to develop and improve the way both academic and non-academic researchers approach the question of inequality. By bringing together researchers from the social sciences and humanities, and stakeholders from the public and third sectors, it will help disseminate knowledge, practices and approaches on the theme of inequality. In addition, by supporting research on how best to chart inequality in long-term perspective, it will contribute to the improvement of measures, questions and approaches by a variety of organisations that study, for instance, poverty, social mobility and discrimination. These include public sector bodies such as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, policy-makers within government and the civil service, and third-sector bodies such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation or the King's Fund.\n\nFurthermore, the outputs of the research network will serve to inform and support wider public debate on the question of inequality, providing rigorous, relevant and accessible information on the work of researchers in the field. Most importantly, rather than joining a given side in debates about distribution and equality, the network's outputs will encourage those who engage with its outputs to reflect on the processes through which societies assign merit and value, and how those change over time.\nIn short, the work of the research network will have a substantial and widespread impact by:\n\n1. Generating knowledge about how inequalities arise, change and persist; \n\n2. Sharing best practice in research and develop methods and approaches to how to measure and understand inequality; and \n\n3. Informing public debates about foundational questions of distribution, fairness and merit.\n\nThis will be of particular interest to:\n\na. Third sector organisations in the UK concerned with the study of inequality and poverty, and their alleviation, such as: the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Oxfam GB, the Michael Young Foundation and The Equalities Trust.\nb. Public and Third Sector institutions concerned with the measurement and charting of economic and social inequalities, including the Office for National Statistics and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission.\nc. Policy-makers in the areas of domestic social policy, but also in the fields of international development and public health.\n\nThese impacts will be achieved by:\n\n1. Engaging non-academic beneficiaries through every stage of the network's activities, including in setting the questions and agenda of the network (Workshop 1); by participating in the events; and contributing to the network's outputs.\n\n2. Creating a public website including copies of papers and other outputs, reports of discussion, blog entries by participants, as well as links and resources relating to the theme of the network.\n\n3. Publishing high-quality outputs that are also accessible to a general audience, and encourage and supporting network participants in producing outputs directed at the general public (magazine and newspaper articles; blog posts etc.)\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22934</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Philomathia Social Sciences Research Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Philomathia Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C6F6C336-9D88-49D8-806D-159AD756CEB4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447b678b871d7.75788840</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research and synegries made possible by the award led to several points of contact with non-academic and crossover groups interested in gaining an historical perspective on inequality.

1. The PI was invited to contribute a chapter to a leading annual report on global development, co-published by the French Development Agency, the The Energy and Resources Institute (India), and the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (Paris), a publication wide widespread influence and reach amongs global development practitioners and policy makers. The report was published separately in English, French and Chinese.

2. The blog (http://inequalityandhistory.blogspot.co.uk) created as part of the project and the associated twitter feed have gained a substantial readership, bringing historical research on economic and social inequality to a wide audience. To date (23/02/2016), the blog has had over 28,000 individual views, while the twitter feed @ineqhist continues to gain followers (currently over 500), many of them leading institutional accounts.

3. In addition, building on the work of the network, the PI has continued to engage with wider communities on the issue of inequality - from speaking at the 2015 Rustat Conference on Inequality (an event bringing together &amp;quot;decision-makers from the frontlines of politics, business, finance, the media, and education to discuss the vital issues of the day with leading academic experts&amp;quot; - http://www.rustat.org/reports/RustatConferenceOnInequality-2015.pdf ) to helping set up the University of Cambridge's Strategic Research Initiative on Inequality, working in partnership with the polling organisation YouGov.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A89C216D-0DA9-480C-A10E-B0490B68C713</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc6145d2db95.99067483</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The AHRC Network Grant was not directed at 'findings' as such, rather at supporting a 2-year programme of events aimed at beginning to build connections and a space for interdisciplinary discussion and dissemination of work on inequality in historical perspective. 

In this regard the network can list some important achievements, namely: 

1. The organisation a number of open call events that were the launchpad for publications and new research by dozens of scholars across the social sciences and humanities, from the UK, Europe and elsewhere.
