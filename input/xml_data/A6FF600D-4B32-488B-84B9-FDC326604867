It is promoted as enabling an easier integration of environmental goods and services into economic processes and policies. However, many researchers suggest that an EA is 'science in the making' and emerging policy initiatives overlook complexities that stem from both uncertain scientific underpinnings and socio-economic divisions. These include gender divisions and inequalities, yet these topics are largely absent from ESB discussions. While feminist writers (and others) suggest caution with adopting an EA, ADEPT seeks to explore if and how the approach could be useful for promoting wellbeing for women and men. While environmental justice scholars have long suggested that socio-economic hardship and the distribution of environmental goods and bads are correlated, recent applications of intersectional theory suggest that practical experiences of exclusion from opportunity always intermesh with other divisions such as those based on race, social class, disability status, sexuality, age and geographical location. There is then a need to address environmental and socio-economic vulnerability in an integrated manner. To do so an EA needs to first address a binary exclusion; firstly, there is a need to highlight ways in which ESB frame environmental quality, often affording stronger representation to expert interpretation of how environmental quality is experienced. Secondly, there is need to understand how intersecting vulnerabilities influence access to a range of ESB (with a focus on those linked to urban blue-green space e.g. clean water, flood mitigation and recreational opportunities).

The focus of the current research will be a major urban zoning project in Belo Horizonte (BH), which covers a range of land-use types from dense low-income urban districts to rich gated neighbourhoods, protected areas, commercial and industrial districts. This provides an ideal case study area in which to trial and extend understandings of gendered vulnerability to environmental change within local urban contexts. Research to be undertaken will involve identifying socio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities and zones of interaction, exploration of differential experiences of urban ESB and scoping the potential of these as a means to support poverty alleviation in urban transformations. Results from BH will also be discussed within a Sao Paulo (SP) context, through the involvement of field researchers from SP currently involved in a local community engagement project involving the redevelopment of urban water management policies. 

The research collaboration is organised around a series of four international research workshops. An online research community will support the combination and interrogation of both new and existing data sets and development of new evidence of the processes which underpin urban vulnerability, forming the context within which any resilience solutions would need to be derived.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ADEPT is a collaboration and research project exploring and developing the potential of the Ecosystems Approach (EsA) for deriving sustainable outcomes in the context of the current complex and accelerating urban transformations. The innovative and internationally-relevant research partnership collaboratively developed by all partners contributes to the economic development and welfare of Brazil at both a:
* sector level - enabling a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between socio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities to be developed and understanding of how this may be integrated within planning and policy processes
* country level - supporting the development of a long-term Brazil-UK partnership with the necessary multiple skill sets to participate in the global urban transformation arena 

It uses emerging UK research to support key poverty and development issues already being explored by Brazilian partners to be viewed through alternative lenses generating novel understandings of a global relevance. The main impact of ADEPT is therefore in the provision of a platform of communication for the involved academics, enabling interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and understanding and for development of a closer network between the involved UK and Brazilian partners for the purpose of further research bids. The resulting academic outputs will consist of a minimum of two co-authored peer reviewed papers that will also be presented in conference fora. ADEPT will trial and validate a mobile phone app for data collection on ecosystem services, goods and benefits (ESBs) and produce guidance on avoiding a gender bias in the application of the EsA approach to the management of urban transformations. Users of these outputs are planning and policy officials from local and national administrations in Brazil and the UK. In addition to academic conferences and papers, findings will be disseminated at a local to international scale through an on-line community, which includes direct involvement of policy developers, planners, community representatives and academics. ADEPT field work funded by CONFAP will involve community members directly, providing the disadvantage community in Belo Horizonte an opportunity to contribute and learn from the research process.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45447</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Centre for Water Systems, University of Exeter</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F11ABE3A-5EC8-49F2-AF62-B18A7B34AFCE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lian Lundy presented work to people from an engineering background who were interested in multiple benefits of urban green space.

They were involved in the collective design process, coding, digitising and early analysis, thus learning from the UK and Brazilian teams.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>582ddd961a8ef8.54043060</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engendering Habitat III</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49837DAC-5034-488C-B0AF-7DE72D5DB53A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference presentation by PI Sarah Bradshaw</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>583026aa4ce164.86887192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4100</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>HEFCE Newton Fund ODA</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Newton Fund</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A4F90CD8-0B73-45F4-897A-CFD378DA110A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c74b0c9704.95888229</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The methods and findings will feed into the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Development Planning process, the methodology for the second phase of which is being discussed now.

It focused on ecosystem services (ES) - the services derived from the natural environment (street trees, for example) which may produce goods and benefits (such as shade, enhanced air quality, drainage and aesthetic pleasure) for individuals and communities. To date the majority of ES studies have focused on rural areas, with comparatively little research focusing on the delivery of ES in urban environments. Even less well understood is how access to such services can vary -who can or cannot access ES, and why, including lack of consideration of gendered experiences of ES. 

The study began from the premise that access to, and control over, environmental assets will not be equal for all and the urban poor may have limited access to ES, with women having less access still. 

The study centred on a peripheral neighbourhood of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, which is close to open countryside and a large reservoir.

It found that far from being free for all, both urban green spaces and the adjoining countryside should be understood as a site of intersecting inequalities - with the poor, the less educated, and women having less access to this important environmental asset. 

Women in the study had less access to a range of other private and public environmental assets including trees in backyards, access to urban green spaces such as parks, and to the reservoir. They were also less likely to report 'green' attitudes, such as seeing local green spaces as an important asset to the community. As the gender and environment literature often presents women as 'closer to nature' this is perhaps a surprising finding, that deserves further study. 

The differential gendered access is important as the study also found that environmental assets interact with other assets to affect wellbeing, and highlights the inter-related nature of different types of assets or capitals - including human, social, physical and financial. 

The frame for the study was a combination of assets frameworks (as favoured by UK Department for International Development) and the ecosystem services approach (as promoted by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment) using the categories of ecosystem services to elaborate the 'natural capital' element of the assets frameworks. This presents a significant conceptual advancement in both fields.

The study combined traditional social science research tools, such as questionnaires and interviews, with scientific tools - a scientific assessment of potential ES for the area. It also utilised an innovative walking narrative methodology, utilising mobile phone technology to record verbally and visually the opinions of residents on the environment, uploading geo-referenced captioned pictures to a web based data set. The latter allowed for a comparison of what is often presented as an 'objective' scientific analysis of ES in the area, with how the people themselves utilised and understood the natural environment as an 'asset' and provided new insights into how the environment is experienced subjectively. 

The combination of methods and collective analysis of findings, provided a joint learning opportunity for the multi-disciplinary team that included engineers and town planners, as well as those working within the natural sciences, social sciences and gender.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are to be discussed with local actors including governmental and non-governmental in Belo Horizonte.
Since 2011 UFMG, and the Brazilian PI, has been contributing to the process of metropolitan development planning for the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte (RMBH) (34 municipalities, 5.5 million inhabitants, about 10 thousand km2 of area). One of the key concepts guiding this planning process is the notion of blue green networks. The concepts and methods adopted in the ADEPT project (e.g. peoples' perception of ecosystem services goods and bads, interview and walk methods, assessment of SPU through satellite image, ground truthing) will play a direct and important role in the blue green network conceptualisation to be used in the forthcoming planning process. 
In May 2017 the findings are to be shared with a urban 'think tank' based in the Mar&amp;eacute; favela in Rio de Janeiro with a view to undertaking some work with/in the favela in the future. 
Since completion of the study the methodology has been adapted for a study in Nicaragua and the findings will be shared with women's groups and movements there.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C6250104-B9F0-4403-83B0-5D9CD404A20B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e02debbea749.02750553</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M011631/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BFE597D-D128-481A-A949-5847F619966F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6DEB3C9-18A0-4A06-87C5-8C347DF98C60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>648B790C-8CC1-40BA-B713-BF27B871D211</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4E9565D3-0753-4FDB-9DCF-1CFF2C985313</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urbanisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
