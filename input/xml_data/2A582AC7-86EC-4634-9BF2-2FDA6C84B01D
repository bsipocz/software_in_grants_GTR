However, evidence shows that women and men, and girls and boys, often have differing experiences of policy interventions across a broad range of areas including healthcare, transport and criminal justice.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The assumption of gender-neutrality can lead to policies that impact unequally on men and women. The budget process can therefore sustain and reinforce gender inequalities by not recognising, and subsequently accounting for, the different needs of women and men. As a result, resources are allocated inefficiently and unequally between men and women.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A key example of where a gender-neutral approach to policy formulation and resourcing has led to the replication and reinforcement of gender inequalities can be found in the Scottish Modern Apprenticeship (MA) programme.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research and knowledge exchange programme has two main aims:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to design a tailored Gender Impact Analysis (GIA) tool for public sector bodies/government departments linked to spending allocations that can be applied to any social/economic policy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to develop a case study of Scottish Modern Apprenticeships (MAs) as a worked example that would assist public bodies/government departments in implementing the GIA tool.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research bid seeks to influence policy and practice in relation to Modern Apprenticeships (MAs) and gender. The MA programme currently represents a somewhat 'missed opportunity' for a national training programme to challenge occupational segregation and stereotyping in the labour market thus helping to overcome gender inequality in training, work and pay. The MA programme currently reinforces inequality but, could affect real, positive change in terms of the 'gap' between male and female labour market outcomes if occupational segregation was fully considered in the implementation and funding of the programme. The ESRC highlights the need to &amp;quot;identify and to test the interventions that will impact quickly and positively on inequality&amp;quot; (ESRC 2009-2014: 20). Ultimately this research aims to influence public policy to eliminate significant gender bias in participation patterns and in resource allocation in the context of MAs.
This work builds on the research track record of the PI, Prof McKay and academic team in collaboration with Close the Gap. Close the Gap is a partnership initiative between Scottish Government, the Equality and Human Rights Commission; Scottish Enterprise, and Highlands and Islands Enterprise; Skills Development Scotland; and the STUC. Impact therefore is aimed at the consolidation of a more gender aware approach to policy making. If successful, impact should also reach young people in Scotland through the breakdown of barriers to occupational choice therefore providing opportunity for all to flourish in a truly modern Scottish labour market. 
While there is a history of partnership between the WiSE Research Centre at GCU, and Close the Gap (see for example Thomson 2007 &amp;amp; 2009), this particular research/knowledge exchange collaboration will optimise a research strength in gender and MAs with the applied knowledge and reach of Close the Gap's extensive networks, to the benefit of policy makers, employers, trade unions, women's organisations, NGO's charities and public sector organisations. 
The Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED), the Scottish Government's political commitment to equalities and particularly, the significant inroads made towards GIA of the budget process in Scotland, indicates this research has the potential to be of great significance to policy makers. The project will feed directly in to the work of the Equality Budgets Advisory Group of the Scottish Government, who provide advice and support in the promotion of equality mainstreaming with specific reference to the resource allocation process. The PI sits on this group and the work associated with it has directly informed the Equality Statement now published routinely as a key component of the Scottish budget documents. The progress and outputs associated with this project will feature as a key focus for the ongoing work of EBAG and as a Ministerial advisory group outputs will be reported directly to the relevant Scottish Government Minister.
Close the Gap plays a critical role in ensuring routes to impact through its own network of partners and stakeholders. It works with policy makers, employers, trade unions and women's organisations to address occupational segregation, a key cause of the gender pay gap. 
Close the Gap's role in this partnership is designed to optimise potential impact through the following collaborative activities; engagement with external stakeholders; maintain a knowledge exchange dialogue with the academic research team, including bringing the experience of working with employers; collaborate with GCU academics to disseminate the findings of the GIA of the MA programme for non-academic audiences; involvement in two seminars, one hosted by Close the Gap and one hosted by WiSE at GCU; extending beyond the life of the project, identify areas where the GIA tool could be used to support organisations to meet their PSED requirements, and to make transparent the gendered outcomes of spend.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17031</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005685/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
