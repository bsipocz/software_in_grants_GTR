In particular, women from black-Caribbean backgrounds have been disproportionately affected. One way to address this problem is by providing behavioural interventions to enable women to acquire new skills that help reduce their future risk of STI, HIV and unwanted pregnancies. However, developing and evaluating entirely new interventions can be time consuming and potentially expensive, and this problem is urgent. An alternative would be to translate an intervention we already know works with other minority women, into a format that specifically addresses UK black-Caribbean women. However we know very little about what is required to translate such interventions to new groups successfully. That is the aim of our research: To translate a proven intervention into a format culturally specific to young UK black-Caribbean women, and to pilot it assessing its feasibility and acceptability. 

There are 3 stages involved in this research. The first involves reviewing in detail the parent intervention, that is, the one we are trying to reproduce, and how it was developed and implemented. The second stage involves undertaking new research with black-Caribbean women, and other consumers, community and service stakeholders to identify areas of specific need, and to determine what can be done to improve young black-Caribbean women?s sexual health options. In the third stage, we use the information obtained in stage 2, and with assistance from community stakeholders and young black-Caribbean women themselves, begin adapting the content of the intervention to specifically address black-Caribbean women?s needs. We then pilot the ?new? intervention with groups of women to see what they think, making more minor adaptations along the way, based on what we see happening and what the women feedback to us. At the end of our research we will have developed an intervention package that is culturally specific to the expressed and actual needs of young black-Caribbean women. 
 
To be successful our research relies heavily on the involvement of black-Caribbean women and others in the community. To ensure that there are different ways people from the community can contribute, we are devising our research in partnership with a respected local organisation and a specialist in patient advocacy. They will help us make sure the community knows about our work and feels able to have as much involvement as possible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Effective behavioural interventions to address the deteriorating sexual health of young women from black and minority ethnic communities are needed urgently. There are few clinically effective interventions, based on rigorous randomised controlled trials (RCT) and none, specifically targeting women, that are routinely provided in UK sexual health or contraceptive services. Our aim is to translate a proven intervention into a format that is culturally specific to young UK black-Caribbean women, and pilot it to assess its acceptability, feasibility and potential in UK sexual health settings. 

The parent intervention for this translation study, known as Project SAFE, was originally developed for in formats for African-American and for Hispanic women in Texas, USA. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in two rigorous randomised controlled trials (RCT). Project SAFE is a good candidate for this type of translation research because its development followed carefully defined stages that closely resemble the processes recommended by the MRC. This included selecting a validated model of behaviour change, extensive formative research and piloting of successive iterations. Its objectives and content of Project SAFE were largely the same for both groups of women and concentrated on reducing STI risks. However unique ?cultural cues? that played to the women?s individual realities, that supported personal risk recognition and that could be used to motivate behaviour change, were integrated into the intervention content and delivery, thus making it cultural specific and adding to its relevance. Our study will test the hypothesis that pragmatic accelerated development of a culturally specific behavioural intervention for young black-Caribbean women can be achieved by combining: a) faithful replication of the structure, delivery and implementation procedures of Project SAFE; with b) precise adaptations to the intervention content and delivery scripts based on formative research with young black-Caribbean women.

The proposed methods for this study involve a comprehensive review of the formative, development and implementation aspects of Project Safe; qualitative research employing innovative participatory methodologies, with consumer, community and service stakeholders, as well as detailed, in-depth work with young black-Caribbean women themselves. Making the actual adaptations to the parent intervention for the UK context will involve the entire study team as well consumer and community representatives. The final research stage involves a pilot study of the translated intervention with young black-Caribbean women to assess its acceptability, feasibility and potential for wider use in UK sexual health services.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>192020</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Patrick Clements Clinic staff meeting-Presentation of qualitative study findings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:id>7DF913D0-61F7-4AD6-A20B-228DF1DCBAFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The findings on the context of sexual risk taking among the young people in NW London were presented to the GUM clinic staff during a staff meeting.
