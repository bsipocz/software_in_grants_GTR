In the last 10 years the technology to enable this type of research as improved massively, as has our ability to understand the data. Genome sequencing has changed from an activity that required a bespoke factory scale facility to something that requires a single instrument which can be run in university labs across the UK and now even in hand-held devices. However, as the process has become quicker and cheaper, we can now design much larger and more powerful studies and there is still a need for bespoke facilities that can handle the larger study designs that are now possible. 

Here we propose to purchase the most recent iteration of short-read sequencing technology, The NovaSeq 6000 and install it at the Earlham Institute, which hosts the BBSRC National Capability in Genomics and Single Cell Analysis. This instrument will enable much more rapid and much cheaper sequencing than was previously possible at EI. The EI is an ideal environment for this instrument as it has access to automation for upstream sample prep. It has a highly trained workforce with a well-established training program and career progression for service delivery staff. EI also has very good IT infrastructure and a team of Bioinformaticians supporting the sequencing lab. 

Over a six month period the EI plan to install the platform, benchmark it and make it accessible to the UK bioscience community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to purchase an Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencer to replace the HiSeq 4000 instruments in the Earlham Institute Genomics Pipelines lab which is part of the BBSRC funded National Capability in Genomics. We propose a number of pilot studies (which we will fund) that will enable us to benchmark the performance of the instrument for a number of different study types (including genome re-sequencing, RNAseq and metagenomics). We will then role out this new platform as part of the National Capability in Genomics so that it will be accessible to the entire bioscience community on a competitive fee for service basis. This project has been designed in consultation with a number of other sequencing service labs, and our experience with the platform will be shared. 

The NovaSeq has a number of distinct advantages over the current systems. There are a range of different flow-cells that all have greater capacity than the HiSeq 4000s which enable higher throughput and more flexibility in the type of runs that can be performed. The cost per megabase can be up to half the price of current systems and the two-dye coding system enables much faster imaging times. Illumina have stated that this machine architecture will be used to deliver the $100 genome, which means that it will likely be incrementally improved in cost and throughput. 

The EI has excellent facilities to house this instrument with automation in place for DNAseq and RNAseq library construction, target capture and low input protocols. 

This project will improve delivery of a number of BBSRC projects including the cross institute Designing Future Wheat Institute Strategic Programme. It will also reduce costs for BBSRC researchers accessing the national capability and increase EI capacity to work with industrial partners.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The addition of a new and improved DNA sequencing platform at EI, capable of significantly extends the capabilities of the National Capability in Genomics. This added value, will accelerate genomic research, reap long-term economic benefits and create new commercial opportunities in the UK.

Advanced academic scientific facilities are and important asset for the the UK Bioeconomy and creates new commercial opportunities for research. The proposed capital investment promises to improve cost-effectiveness, efficiency, scalability and benefit all research at the Earlham Institute. EI already collaborates with a number of multinational companies such as Bayer and Unilever but also with local companies on Norwich Research Park such as food forensics. Increased capacity in the genomics pipeline will enable us to do more of this type of consultancy and service work. 

To ensure that we disseminate the utility of the new platform we will work with our KEC team to produce publicity and social media interest. We already undertake a many commercial engagement events such as open days to ensure that local and regional businesses are aware of the facilities and capabilities at EI.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>767827</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R014329/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4661C82D-F66E-4672-BA82-7C12180BBDF7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technology and method dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
