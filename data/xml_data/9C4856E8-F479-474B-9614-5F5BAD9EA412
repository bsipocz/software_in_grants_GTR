Indeed, many other food- and cash-crops such as wheat, rice, maize, soybean, barley, potato, cotton, canola, and others are susceptible to many different types of diseases. Over a million people died during the Great Irish Famine in the 19th century as the result of a potato blight epidemic. Currently, the world's most popular fruit, the Cavendish banana, is under threat of extinction due to infection by highly virulent fungal pathogens [1]. Recently, the reduction of citrus yields also largely affects the manufacture and economy, due to the infection of 'tree-killing' bacteria [2].

Plant diseases also threaten the environment. There are &amp;gt;80 million Ash trees growing in UK forests and along neighborhood roads currently under threat of Ash dieback disease, caused by a relentless fungal pathogen [3]. Recent estimates project that 75% of Ash trees in the south and east England will be infected by this disease by 2018 [3]. Battling diseases that affect our crops and trees is a global challenge requiring the work of scientists in both academia and industry, as well as the work of policy-makers and government.

Pathogens are capable of infecting plants and causing disease largely because they can suppress plant immune systems. Thus, only when we clearly understand plant immunity will we be able to offer sustainable solutions to diseases that affect our crops.

Scientists in the UK have always been seeking knowledge of how to achieve durable and sustainable disease resistance for crops. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which plants establish full resistance against various pathogens is essential to design better strategies for protecting crops from field diseases. The plant immune system is multifaceted and composed of many different proteins with broad functions. In the battle between the host and pathogens, plant gene expression and regulations play a central role in establishing an effective immune response.

The aim of this work is to find out exactly how immune gene regulators, especially transcription factors (proteins that regulate gene expressions), work at the molecular level, how they are activated or repressed, and how they influence the amplitude of immune responses. Different pathogens use different strategies to attack the same host plants, so a major challenge is how to boost the plant immunity against all pathogens without compromise; with the correct combinations, and how to control their expression precisely. Understanding the changes to chromatin (histone protein with DNA molecules) that occur during the immune process is key to decode the genetic information of immune gene regulations.

To address these important questions, I will study host proteins involved in the interaction between the model plant Arabidopsis and its pathogens. Working with a model plant offers many advantages over directly studying crop plants, the most important being the wealth of genetic and technological tools available (fully sequenced and annotated genome, thousands of mutants and worldwide data repositories) and the general ease of experimentation (small stature, fast growth, and convenient breeding techniques). The project will be undertaken at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich [4], a world-leading research institute dedicated to working on plant-microbe interactions, and will involve collaborative work with laboratories in Canada. Knowledge gained from this project will advance our understanding of how plants defend themselves against pathogens and provide agricultural practices to improve crop yield.

Precise gene regulation is crucial for a rapid and robust immunity. My recent work has shown that the master transcription factors SARD1 and CBP60g display novel functions in regulating downstream genes and immunity-related cell death. A breakthrough was achieved when I established 1) an Arabidopsis line (SUPER-ETI) carrying an inducible pathogenic effector stacked with its corresponding R proteins; 2) a low-cost and high-resolution capture sequencing method; 3) the fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting-based assay for transposase-accessible chromatin to map in vivo cis-regulatory elements.

My long-term research questions are: 1) How are SARD1/CBP60g regulated? 2) How do they regulate immunity? 3) How do they influence cell death? 4) Can we use SUPER-ETI to perform forward genetics screens to identify novel proteins involved in plant immune signaling?

To address these, I will 1) use co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to discover interaction partners of SARD1/CBP60g and the immune component EDS1. Candidate proteins will be characterized by analyzing T-DNA insertion or CRISPR/Cas9-introduced non-function mutants; 2) use phosphor-proteomics to identify the regulatory residues of SARD1 in response to kinases. Differential and/or quantitative protein modifications may establish specificity between different immune pathways, possibly by affecting subcellular localization, binding partners, or enzymatic activity; 3) use both capture and genome-wide sequencing to establish a comprehensive map of epigenetic immune networks; 4) use forward genetics in SUPER-ETI/sard1/cbp60g to identify novel immune regulators.

R protein recognition mechanisms are conserved amongst plant species, so we believe the state-of-the-art knowledge obtained from this research can advance both fundamental (immune networks) and translational (breeding for optimal immunity and yield) research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
The findings of this research will be of interest to and benefit many groups of people. Plant diseases pose a real threat to food security, and a molecular understanding of plant immunity is absolutely necessary if we are to develop solutions and preventative measures to keep our crops healthy. Understanding how plants defend against pathogens while maintaining optimal yield is of great interest to the UK/EU agri-biotech industry both in terms of herbicide chemistry and genetically modified (GM) crops. Translational work stemming from this project could contribute monitoring disease, guiding the plans for plant breeding, generating environmentally sustainable crops with an optimal immune system. This topic, therefore, has the potential to be of interest to UK/EU policy makers refining current laws regarding GM crops and chemical use in our fields, and to the general public. Continuing the tradition of world-class research at these institutes, therefore, contributes to the economic wealth of Norwich and the UK.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
Although often overlooked, plants are extremely important to the well-being of the UK and the world. Not only are plants a major source of our food, clothing, and building materials, they are increasingly becoming a major source of fuel as well. Microbial diseases and pests place major constraints on agriculture and have significant economic and social impacts. One way to improve plant disease resistance is to enhance the capability of the plants' own innate immune system through genetic modification. However, enhancing immune responses without affecting plant yield is a difficult task. Research in genetically tractable model systems allows detailed biological mechanisms to be uncovered that may have far-reaching impacts on agriculture. It is worth noting that the host supervisor, Prof Jonathan Jones, is currently actively engaged with translational applications based on his work on model plants and crops, and interacts with several non-academic groups and Agri-biotech companies that would benefit from the proposed research. Together with Prof Cathie Martin, he co-founded a spin-out company, Norfolk Plant Sciences. Moreover, TSL is actively engaged in many translational projects with different industrial partners. However, any potential translational applications from this work are likely to be realized in the future and are beyond the scope of this proposal.

Given my track record in public engagement and my dedication to teaching and outreach, it is expected that this project will increase public awareness and understanding of plant biology and GM technology. For example, I previously participated in Norwich Science Festival where we engaged the public in the kind of plant research we do at TSL, including the controversial GM potato field trial. We set up a kiosk where interested people could come and infiltrate tobacco leaves and observe microbial infections on Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we used a light microscope to demonstrate what infected tissues look like close-up. Future participation in SIND and other outreach projects will ensure public engagement with the proposed research. For example, I will help to host summer students in the lab and engage budding scientists through online outreach programs such as 'I'm a scientist, get me out of here.' Furthermore, BBC East Anglia and ITV Anglia are based in Norwich, providing excellent opportunities for radio and/or television engagement.

In addition, I had experience writing short articles for non-specialist audiences as part of my Ph.D. training and would be happy to write these sorts of articles about my work. As I gain more independence as a researcher, I think it is necessary to set up a personal scientific web page to outline my research interested and how they impact society. Therefore, I will set up a Wordpress-hosted page within the first 6 months of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>303845</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R012172/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1F190F7B-B800-40B2-B250-62AD4842598F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioinformatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6EF57B2-8ACD-48E6-9B45-98507446B053</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigenetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C640FECC-44CA-4B72-8D37-BE5E5DC0324C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interaction with organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>20FF6FDE-28DB-4D9D-99E6-8470C745EA60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transcriptomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
