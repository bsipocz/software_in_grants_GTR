In response, there has been a huge growth in statistical methods for large-scale ecological models. However, most such methods do not account for the fact that ecological data is inherently heterogeneous, and large datasets typically contain many forms of bias.

Recently, a set of hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) have emerged as promising ways for dealing with biased data, particularly for occurrence records and other unstructured data. Many millions of unstructured occurrence records exist, so the potential of these new methods is enormous. 

Not all data contain biases, though. A minority of biodiversity data is highly structured in terms of the sample locations, fixed protocols and regular sampling. Ideally, we'd like to retain the information about this in our models, but combine it with the much larger sample sizes of unstructured datasets.

Integrated models provide a way to do this. They are a subclass of HBM in which data heterogeneity is modelled explicitly, by treating datasets with different observation processes as independent realisations of the same underlying state. For example, causal observations on GBIF and the Breeding Bird Survey both contain information about whether the population of a particular species was extant at a particular point in space and time.

At present, these integrated models are the preserve of highly competent statisticians. They are hard to specify and difficult to fit and diagnose. One goal of this partnership is to build an extensible framework for fitting integrated models that will make them accessible to a broad community of ecological modellers. This framework, in the form of open source tools, will make it easier for ecologists to handle biased data when addressing large-scale questions about biodiversity.

Although attractive from a conceptual standpoint, it is unclear whether the sophistication of integrated models deliver real benefits over simple ones. In particular there is an urgent need for some general principles about how to proceed when both structured and unstructured data sources are available. Critical questions include:
Q1. When and how should we combine datasets with different properties?
Q2. Under what circumstances is simple aggregation (i.e. ignoring the different observation processes) better than integration? 
Q3. If we suspect the data contain biases, can we detect them and handle them adequately?
Q4. What are the most appropriate metrics for information content and model fit?

These general questions lie at the intersection of the research interests of PI Isaac, Co-I Henrys and Project Partner O'Hara. Each has made some progress towards addressing specific aspects of these questions. Working in partnership would add significant value to each, by taking existing research beyond the specific context and toward general answers to these big questions. It would permit a co-ordinated effort and build a work program of international significance.
 
This pump-priming award would provide a platform for this partnership. The overall aim is to build a framework for inference in large-scale models of species' distribution, and to test it using computer simulations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Three types of non-academic activity will benefit from the research described in this proposal.

1. Design of biodiversity monitoring programs 
Large-scale structured biodiversity monitoring is expensive: ensuring cost-effective survey design is a major priority for the agencies that commission such research, particularly in the current climate of government austerity. In the UK, the principle agencies are JNCC, Defra, Natural England, Scottish Natural Heritage etc. These agencies are attracted to the potential of citizen science and opportunistic recording to generate large volumes of data at relatively low cost. However, the value of these data types is questionable, due to the lack of structure in how data are collected. Integrated modelling provides a way to combine these unstructured data with more traditional structured surveys. To some extent this has already happened: the new Defra-funded Pollinator Monitoring Scheme has been designed with elements of structured and unstructured data observation processes, using a mixture of professional surveyors and citizen scientists. The 'rules of thumb' arising from this project will make it possible design cost-effective biodiversity surveillance schemes in which stratified random sampling using formal protocols by professional scientists can be augmented by large-scale observations by citizen scientists (and vice versa). In this way, the outcomes of this research project will support decisions about future scheme designs, both in the UK and internationally.

2. Reporting on biodiversity targets
Biodiversity indicators are a key tool for reporting against national targets and international treaty obligations (including the &amp;quot;Aichi targets&amp;quot;). Currently, the UK has eleven biodiversity indicators that report on the status of species, of which nine use data from structured surveys and two use unstructured occurrence records (both new indicators were developed by the project team). For many species there are multiple datasets available, but there is no obvious way to combine them. By providing clear guidance on data integration, our research will ensure that biodiversity indicators make the best use of available data and prevent arbitrary choices are being made about which data to use. This will be a welcome development for agencies with responsibility for delivering biodiversity indicators, both in the UK (JNCC and Defra) and internationally.

3. International Networks
The biodiversity crisis is a global phenomenon, and biodiversity itself does not respect international borders. For this reason, there is a need to coordinate responses to the biodiversity crisis across nations, in which IPBES and GEO-BON have an important role to play. Part of this role involves synthesising large quantities of information about biodiversity from different countries. Data integration, and the development of models that facilitate such integration, is necessary to form a coherent narrative at the global scale. The development of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), led by GEO-BON, is one way in which synthesis can be achieved. PI Isaac recently contributed to the design of a roadmap for building EBVs for species' distribution and abundance at the global scale, in which integrated models (to account for data heterogeneity) were highlighted as a key knowledge gap.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32110</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R005133/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE30777A-E4A8-486B-875D-58CC92FD5525</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
