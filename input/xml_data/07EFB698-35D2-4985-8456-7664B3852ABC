Science</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005525/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The research for this Fellowship will form a major part of the first systematic study of the relationship between Pre-Raphaelite art in all its forms and science. The Pre-Raphaelites were the most original, experimental and influential of Victorian art movements, and they remain the most popular. The last year alone has seen major exhibitions of the Pre-Raphaelites and Italy, photography, drawing and design. It may seem counter-intuitive to link the Pre-Raphaelites, famous for their medievalism, to science, but they were the only Victorian artists to make this link repeatedly in their own manifestos, from essays in their early periodical 'The Germ' (1850) to Holman Hunt's retrospective account of the movement 'Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood' (1905). In such writings they argued that art should draw on and even emulate the sciences. Many critics have seen this as a marker of the Pre-Raphaelites' claim to being a modern art movement, but few have taken it seriously as a guide to how we might read their art itself. 

I will be exploring in detail the different positions the Pre-Raphaelites took on the relationship between art and science, to see how far the claims they make for how art should respond to science are borne out in their painting, design, sculpture and poetry. During the Fellowship itself I will be working on four key topics. 

Firstly, I will be working closely with the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and the Natural History Museum in South Kensington to see how the Pre-Raphaelites influenced the buildings in which the Victorians put their scientific view of the natural world on display. Through the patronage of John Ruskin, the Pre-Raphaelites were directly involved in the design and decoration of the Oxford University Museum. I will be tracing this involvement in detail, to see how they helped to shape the building, both in practice and through their ideals. I will be looking too at how the Natural History Museum was shaped by Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics, particularly in the decorations that Richard Owen commissioned and Alfred Waterhouse designed for the inside and outside of the building. A close study of these two buildings will show how the spaces which we still use today to present our own scientific understanding of nature were shaped by Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic principles. 

Secondly, I will be conducting an experiment in art criticism to see whether a fuller knowledge of what the Pre-Raphaelites said about science changes how we look at their paintings themselves. I'll be studying Pre-Raphaelite paintings and drawings in the major collections around the UK, including the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Tate Britain, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Walker Art Gallery and the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Liverpool, and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. I'll be working particularly closely with the Manchester Art Gallery and the Manchester Museum to devise ways of involving the general public and scientists themselves in this experiment, based on the existing models of their respective Pre-Raphaelite Experiment and Living Worlds exhibits. 

Thirdly, I will be studying the papers of the Anthropological Society in the Royal Anthropological Institute to see how they bear on the poetry of A. C. Swinburne. Swinburne was a member of the Anthropological Society, at which scientific questions over evolution, race, sex, and the relationship of savagery to civilization were hotly debated between its foundation in 1863 and its merger with the Ethnological Society in 1871. This will be the first thorough study of how these debates are reflected in his poetry from the same period. 

Fourthly, I will be reading systematically through the 'Fortnightly Review' from 1867 to 1873, to put the many Pre-Raphaelite poems published in this periodical in these years back into the context of its well-known commitment to positivism and scientific materialism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to benefiting the academic sector through its contribution to knowledge and understanding in several disciplines, including art history, museum studies, science studies, literature and aesthetics, my research will benefit museums themselves, schools and the general public. It will be valuable too to artists, writers, scientists and others keen to work with and foster the interaction between the arts and sciences in contemporary culture. 

The impact of my research will be predominantly cultural. My work on and with the Oxford University Museum, the Natural History Museum and the Manchester Museum will attract visitors to these museums, help to capitalize on their archives and other collections, and provide them with educational and informational resources. It will provide these museums and others with suggestions for how they may be able to capitalize further on their buildings as cultural objects in themselves, and to explore the interrelation between the nature of their collections and the history and aesthetics of their premises. The general public will also be able to benefit from my research through talks, exhibitions and displays at the Oxford University Museum and the Natural History Museum.

One of the objectives of my research is to determine whether viewing Pre-Raphaelite paintings in the light of science affects what we see in them. While for my monograph I will be conducting a largely historicist study, examining the paintings in the light of Victorian science and its place in culture, in my collaborations with the Manchester Art Gallery and the Manchester Museum I will be looking into ways of inviting the wider public to think about the Pre-Raphaelites' paintings in terms of what they themselves saw to be their scientific approach to art. I will be encouraging both the public and scientists themselves to ask how their paintings might make us think about science and nature today, and vice versa. The outputs related to this aspect of the project will fall outside the time frame of the Fellowship, but they will result directly from the work done during the Fellowship and will again be of interest and cultural benefit to the general public, as well as attracting people to the participating galleries. 

Finally, my research will contribute to the wider project of encouraging active engagement between the arts and the sciences, with benefits to practitioners in both spheres who are keen to foster and explore this relationship.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66994</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Oxford University Museum of Natural History</gtr:department><gtr:description>Visions of Nature</gtr:description><gtr:id>C6591547-3246-4AAF-B35A-36FED3EBDD65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guests of Time (Book - see Publications)

I gave a public lecture at the Oxford University Museum in November 2012 on my research on the Pre-Raphaelites' involvement in the design and decoration of the Oxford University Museum. It was well received by members of the public and museum staff. I was then invited to give the same lecture as part of Oxford Open Doors in September 2014, as well as to launch Oxford Open Doors itself as the guest speaker at the opening reception at the Museum. My collaboration with the Museum is ongoing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5175683223.8060260c19e430</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Building the Book of Nature</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4D8B10E-53D3-484A-BF56-F8958CAB9DAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint public talk on the architecture of the Oxford University Museum given with Janine Rogers (Mount Allison University), drawing on research for this grant and our SSHRC grant, and consisting of a joint lecture, a tour of the museum, and a pop-up exhibition of designs for the museum and its decorations by John Ruskin, Thomas Woolner, Alexander Munro, John Hungerford Pollen and others.

I have been consulted by the Director of Public Engagement, the project team working on the renovation of the Central Hall, and the architects working on the museum. One of the architects, Niall McLaughlin, wrote to me in an email in December 2016 'We have taken great inspiration from your writings and visits'. I have also been interviewed by the museum for an app which is accompanying their new exhibit in the Hintze Hall. My interview will be available to visitors to listen to in connection with a new case displaying an exhibit on the architecture of the museum. I am hoping to take my collaboration with the museum further, and have been discussing how we might achieve this with the Head of Visitor Experience, Learning and Outreach. 
My findings have also informed the launch of a year of arts and engagement activity by the Oxford University Museum of Natural History under the banner 'Visions of Nature'. This involved arts exhibitions, commissioned poetry and a series of events. The project as a whole, and the poetry in particular, were informed by my research into the origins of the museum in the close collaboration of Oxford scientists and Pre-Raphaelite artists. (See Partnerships and Collaborations for more details.)</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FD6D5E67-4F08-4021-B2B2-1839A89AF936</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dadb07651f35.19874586</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have established that the art of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood entailed a sophisticated response to Victorian ideas of science as a progressive and increasingly accurate mode of understanding, in particular in terms of method, as the PRB sought to devise new approaches to creating art and poetry that could live up to the standards set by science. I have traced this process through close interpretation of their art theory, poetry, paintings and sculpture, with particular reference to ecology and psychology in their work, and also to their religious art in various media. In addition, I have shown how Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic principles were taken up in turn by the scientific community itself, in the design and decoration of natural history museums, in education, and in the periodical press. Pre-Raphaelitism therefore directly shaped the scientific culture of Victorian England, as well as the other way around.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am taking my findings further myself through collaborative research on and with natural history museums (NHMs), with an eye to informing and developing practice in exhibitions, public engagement, cross-fertilisation between science and arts, and architectural renovation. I have been working with Prof Janine Rogers (Mount Allison University) and the NHMs in London and Oxford, together with museums in Ireland and Canada, on a research project funded by the Canadian SSHRC, and will be working with Dr Claire Jones (Birmingham) and the Oxford NHM on a Collaborative Doctoral Project on the sculpture and decorative schema of that museum. I am also pursuing further collaborations on the same lines with the NHMs in Vienna and Berlin.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B2E024BF-FD11-4C53-B229-2FDE4A6304BB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dad8ff0175a8.45002983</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F79EE47A-E30D-43C0-A39E-9C4A0EEDEEFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Ruskin's Windows at the Oxford Museum'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ruskin Review and Bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5e95da603c3d884025af6f70d6913c85"><gtr:id>5e95da603c3d884025af6f70d6913c85</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holmes, J.
