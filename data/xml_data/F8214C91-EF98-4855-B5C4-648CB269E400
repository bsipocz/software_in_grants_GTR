The research context is one in which many initiatives have been undertaken in Alberti studies since 1990, leading up to the centenary in 2004. These have taken the form of interdisciplinary conferences and the published proceedings, and also two major editorial initiatives, one in Italy, one in France, to publish in the next ten years Alberti's complete works (the first three volumes appeared in 2002-03). Yet, no comprehensive monograph in any language has been published to offer a rounded picture of this multi-faceted writer. Cecil Grayson, who established the editions of Alberti's vernacular worth's (Bari, 1960-73), never wrote a definitive monograph, though his collected articles were published shortly before his death: Studi su Leon Battista Alberti (Olschki, 1996). In English, there have been only three recent books: by Joan Kelly Gadol (Chicago, 1969), ivlark Jarzombek (Cambridge, MA, 1989) and Anthony Grafton (Harmondsworth, 2000). None of the three books were by experts in Italian literature, and none of them cover the vast body of literary texts written by Alberti. Gadol's book was largely concerned with Alberti the art theorist, and only a few pages of her final chapter (pp. 213-40) were devoted to his literary works. Jarzombek's work has received little attention from scholars since his understanding of Renaissance Latin and Italian seems deeply flawed. Anthony Grafton is a distinguished historian: his Alberti book is largely concerned with the history of ideas and culture, devoting most space to the architectural treatise (hence its subtitle lyiaster Builder of the Italian Renaissance), and to Della famiglia, whereas the other three vernacular dialogues receive barely three pages. In private conversation, Grafton agrees that there is a strong case for a monograph on Alberti written from a literary perspective. 

Italian scholarship on Alberti shows a similar pattern. The enhanced understanding of the writer's importance has been underlined by the appearance of a new journal entirely devoted to his works, Albertiana (1998-), and by several major A conferences, but the only recent monographs are limited in scope: Ponte's Leon Battista Alberti. Umanista e scrittore (Genoa, 1981), deals with the literary not the technical works, and Contarino's L B Alberti moralista (Caltanissetta, 1991) treats ethical not literary issues. Among other single-authored worths, new light was shed on Atberti's Florentine years by Luca Boschetto, Leon Battista Alberti e Firenze (Olschki, 2000), paralleled by Stefano Borsi's work on Alberti the antiquarian in Rome in his Leon Battista Alberti e Roma {Florence, 2003). Rinaldo Rinaldi's 'Melancholia Christiana&amp;quot;. Studi sulle fonti di Leon Battista Alberti (Olschki, 2002) is a collection of articles, the central ones concentrating on just one work (Momus), while Francesco Furlan's Studia Albertiana (Paris-Turin, 2003) is another collection of essays, providing insights into some of the philological and genre problems surrounding the texts. 

The rest of recent scholarship on the author is in the form of articles and conference proceedings. The Atti of three 1990s conferences appeared in 1999, 2000 and 2001 (see Case for Support), and the proceedings of the many centenary conferences of 2004 have just started to appear. 
Potential applications and benefits of the outcome: the completed monograph will be of use to students and researchers in the general area of Renaissance studies, and in the particular fields of Italian, Latin (and Greek) literary studies, reception of classical culture, art history, and architectural history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23502</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings so far have been used mainly by academic experts in the field of Alberti studies, but my hope is that since Alberti worked also in the fields of painting and architecture that future exhibitions on this writer, who was also a painting theorist and architect, will incorporate some of my findings, especially on his ancient sources and on his sense of cultural 'transfer' from ancient to modern times.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA4F004B-0254-4D59-914C-B4067A0CDE00</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>546347cc2c9fa2.41593988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to shed light on the way Leon Battista Alberti (1404-72) used his readings of ancient classical texts in order to develop new cultural attitudes in fifteenth century Italy, and more particularly the process whereby a humanist reader became a writer. The 2007 article on his reading of Cicero's rhetorical works showed the impact of two 'new' texts by Cicero (the Brutus and Orator) discovered in the 1420s. Alberti studied these intensely, which led to his realization that the Latin language had had a diachronic development, and was not a static monolith as had been thought by medieval and some of Alberti's contemporary scholars. He realized that this development could and should be applied to the Italian vernacular in order to allow it to grow as well, thus leading to Alberti's campaigns on behalf of the Italian language. 
The 2009 chapter established that Alberti's canon of literature has four main features which mark it out as different from those of his forebears and contemporaries. The first feature is his appreciation of technical and artistic writers in Latin, such as Columella, Varro, Vitruvius and Pliny. The second striking element is his precocious knowledge of Greek texts: (Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Xenophon, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius). Third is his enthusiasm for comic writers (Plautus, Terence, Martial, the Latin satirists and Lucian in Greek). The final element is Alberti's stylistic sensitivity: he possesses an in-depth knowledge of Cicero's treatises, especially the rhetorical ones, but he never feels tempted to become a Ciceronian, unlike some of his contemporaries. The 2010 article on the Theogenius furthered these researches into his sources and showed the surprising range of texts alluded to in this short vernacular dialogue, especially the author's eagerness to diffuse the knowledge contained in newly discovered Latin texts (Martial, Plautus, Lucretius, Manilius, Silius Italicus and even Tacitus).
The 2010 lecture showed that although Alberti is steeped in ancient texts every bit as much as his predecessors, he inaugurates a real change in the direction of humanism. He develops the revolutionary idea of writing four substantial ethical dialogues in the vernacular, thus elevating vertically the status of the new language. At the same time he expands Latin horizontally: first he cultivates a humorous strain (from the Intercenales to the major novel Momus); secondly after 1443, he becomes more interested in technical treatises, writing his longest work, the treatise on architecture (1453), in Latin. These shifts towards the vernacular, and towards the humorous and technical areas of Latin, represent an inflection of humanism that would have been unthinkable in his predecessors. The lecture also unearthed a new source for his famous motto &amp;quot;Quid tum?&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;What then?&amp;quot;) which he wrote under his symbol of the winged eye. 
The 2011 article on Alberti's Canis (written c. 1438) proved that this semi-humorous Latin funeral oration for his dog, is not just the ultimate display of Alberti's rhetorical virtuosity, but rather something much more serious. The care that the author lavished on its structure, on its impeccably erudite sources, and most of all on its typically Albertian themes of versatility, the work ethic, friendship and humour, reveals it as a work that is as serious as it is ludic, especially as it is a canine version of the extended self-portrait that he would write in his Vita, one of the first autobiographies of modern times.
The 2013 chapter on Alberti's De familia illustrates, by examining his manuscript revisions, the structural care he lavished on the work to endow it with a sense of unity. With the composition and circulation of De familia, the first stage of Alberti's revolutionary campaign to elevate the volgare was complete.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Alberti is such a multi-faceted figure that my findings, particularly on his ancient sources, could be taken forward by other Alberti scholars who work in his more 'technical areas', such as his contribution to painting theory or to architectural history.
