This fundamental growth response is most obvious in primitive organisms such as yeast, but the systems underlying the response are retained in mammalian cells and are increasingly recognised as a vital mechanism for control of cell function in the human body. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of this response diminishes as we age and contributes to a gradual loss in muscle mass (known as 'age-related sarcopenia'), which limits mobility and hence overall health and quality of life. Important components of the nutrient-response system are biological sensors of nutrient availability, one of which (known as SNAT2) we are studying to see whether it can be manipulated so as to counteract the processes underlying development of sarcopenia. SNAT2 is a protein in the surface membrane of most types of human cell which, we have discovered, acts as a sensor (or receptor) for external amino acids in tandem with a well-known role as a transporter of these amino acids into the cell for protein synthesis (and hence cell growth). The double-life of this transporter / receptor protein has led to it being christened the SNAT2 'transceptor'. In common with other proteins, SNAT2 undergoes a continual cycle of synthesis and degradation, a turnover which ensures that SNAT2 is maintained at appropriate levels and that individual SNAT2 molecules are replaced regularly as part of cellular 'housekeeping'. The amount of SNAT2 protein in cells is highly-regulated and is increased when cells are stressed either by amino acid starvation or steroid (dexamethasone) treatment. This up-regulation may be an important part of the cellular response to stress and should help modulate the sensitivity of the SNAT2 transceptor system under different circumstances. Our recent research has shown that SNAT2 turns over relatively quickly and, at least in skeletal muscle cells, its abundance is regulated largely by reducing the rate at which the protein is degraded. SNAT2 proteins are earmarked for degradation by the sequential attachment of a chain of ubiquitin molecules, identifying them as targets for the proteasome, a major component of the biochemical machinery which breaks down cellular proteins. We have preliminary evidence that this ubiquitin-targeting system for SNAT2 is compromised during various stresses, thus stabilizing SNAT2 proteins by reducing their rate of degradation. Because new SNAT2 proteins are continually being synthesized, the net effect is to increase their overall abundance and hence their capacity to signal for cell growth. This project aims to work out how SNAT2 proteins evade degradation during cellular stresses, how much this helps to minimize stress effects (e.g. by maintaining activity of certain growth pathways) and whether the mechanisms involved may be targeted in order to promote cell growth (e.g. to counteract age-related muscle wasting) or, if an inhibitor is developed, to reduce cell growth (e.g. in cancer chemotherapy). Targeted therapies of this type might include specific modifications to protein nutrition as well as drugs which affect activity of SNAT2 or its degradation mechanism, both of which might be of particular benefit to the elderly population in terms improving health and quality of life, as well as reducing overall healthcare costs. There may also be additional spin-off applications and benefits to this research related to the ongoing interest in the ubiquitin - proteasome system as a regulator of several other genes of therapeutic interest (e.g. ENac, a target for treatment of cystic fibrosis).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Amino acids (AAs) exert control over numerous and diverse aspects of cell function. The SNAT2 (System A) AA transporter is widely-distributed in mammalian cells and mediates uptake of neutral AAs for protein synthesis and other metabolic processes. SNAT2 is extensively regulated by hormones (e.g. insulin, glucocorticoids) and AA availability. Our recent work has uncovered surprising depths to its functionality, showing it to operate not only as a transporter but as a component of a sensor for external AA availability, lying upstream of the mTOR signalling pathway which stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth. The expression and/or activity of this SNAT2 'transceptor' is therefore a key determinant not only of AA delivery, but of nutrient-induced signalling events regulating key cell functions. We have discovered that SNAT2 protein expression is substantially regulated by non-genomic mechanisms that promote either its stabilisation in response to diverse catabolic stimuli (e.g. AA starvation, glucocorticoids) or its degradation via the proteosome during conditions of AA sufficiency. This project aims to understand the processes controlling SNAT2 stability, with particular focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating the interplay between SNAT2 and a ubiquitin E3-ligase (Nedd4.2) which labels it for proteasomal degradation. We will examine the hypothesis that Nedd4.2 targets the N-terminal domain of SNAT2 for ubiquitination, but that access to this domain is critically dependent on a conformational change in SNAT2 induced by substrate (Na+ and/or AA) binding. We will also investigate the effects of down-regulation of Nedd4.2 activity/expression (e.g. by glucocorticoid stress) on SNAT2 stability. Such information may facilitate new therapies that stimulate the SNAT2 transceptor to promote protein synthesis or cell growth (e.g. to counteract age-related muscle wasting) or, alternatively, inhibit SNAT2 to impair cell growth (e.g. in cancer chemotherapy).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? Academics: Our current position at the forefront of research into nutrient 'transceptors' in mammalian cells leads us to believe that the proposed research will make a significant scientific contribution with consequent benefits for other academic researchers, especially in the fields of nutrition, physiology and ageing research. Private Sector: Our findings will be of considerable interest to the pharmaceutical and nutrition industries, especially in relation to sarcopenia, cancer and insulin resistance as well as individuals working in sports-related disciplines (e.g. exercise instructors). Government: The findings may help inform policy on dietary and nutrient requirements at both national (e.g. DH, DEFRA) and international (e.g. WHO) levels of organisation and nutrition industries. Public and Charitable Sectors: Individuals working for public health-related disciplines (e.g. dieticians, nutritionists) and scientific advisors to Medical Charities will benefit from the findings in terms of helping devise appropriate nutritional regimes for treatment of clinical disorders, as well as advising their clients of recent advances. General Public: Target beneficiaries include the elderly (especially those with significant sarcopenia) and cancer patients. How will they benefit from this research? Our findings will be of considerable value in the design and development of improved therapeutic approaches to enhance both the efficiency with which the body controls its protein economy and the delivery of dietary amino acids in the most appropriate quantity and composition. Our work will inform development of new drug/nutrition therapies and provide short-term refinements to existing formulations both to help enhance exercise benefits and ameliorate problems of muscle wasting and nutrient-induced insulin resistance. Ultimately, the work will be of particular benefit to the elderly in terms of counteracting age-related sarcopenia and improving health/quality of life and reducing overall healthcare costs. The scientific discoveries, materials and expertise will be made available to other academics and interested commercial beneficiaries through publications, meetings and Material Transfer Agreements, which may benefit the UK economic competitiveness in biopharmaceutical and health products. There may be additional spin-off health applications, related to the potential value of GSK3 as a therapeutic target (e.g. in diabetes and Alzheimers disease) and of Nedd4.2 as a regulator of several proteins of therapeutic interest (e.g. ENac, a target for cystic fibrosis treatment). Appointed staff will benefit from a College-supported Postdoc Association that functions to promote their career development interests and training in public engagement. What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research? The College of Life Sciences (CLS) is committed to maximizing its research impact and has engaged in the inaugural BBSRC Excellence with Impact scheme. Both applicants have established networks for communicating their research and its benefits through public engagement (e.g. via hosting public visits), outreach activities (e.g. the Revealing Research Initiative, Caf&amp;eacute; Science) as well as Medical Charities that they are members of (e.g. Diabetes UK and British Thyroid Association) which interact directly with the public on health issues. The impact of our research is publicised on CLS websites and brochures or, where appropriate, through press releases from the CLS Publicity Office. Our Technology Transfer Office actively engages researchers in matters concerning Intellectual Property Rights and commercial development. In addition to their existing links, Hundal and Taylor are exploring new collaborative possibilities with Unilever and the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health with regard to the future development of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>322392</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health Aberdeen</gtr:department><gtr:description>Modulation of SNAT2 function in iron depleted cells</gtr:description><gtr:id>8A524CEE-51E2-4DE5-8500-3583E3AC0E7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The following publication has recently emerged from this collaboration.

Consequently, understanding how changes in nutrient signalling or impaired function of nutrient sensors, such as SNAT2, may contribute to nutritional-related metabolic disorders is crucial given the alarming increase in public health issues, such as obesity and diabetes. Beyond the academic/industrial beneficiaries of our research we have been active in communicating and framing our findings in a manner that has engaged members of the lay public. The investigators involved in this project have participated in Lab Open Days, Caf&amp;eacute; Science as well as a Schools and Family day event at Dundee Science Centre where the impact of good and poor nutrition on cell function and its implications on personal well-being have been discussed with individuals across the full age spectrum - from very young school children to retired pensioners. The sessions at Dundee Science Centre involved practical and interactive activities that allowed the public to appreciate, in very simple terms, the nature of our research and, importantly, its relevance to public health. The feedback from these sessions was extremely positive and hopefully the information that we have delivered during such events has provided &amp;quot;food for thought&amp;quot; to the visiting public of how nutrition impacts on their health and well-being.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>21F96E88-389A-4001-A94F-D46AA34137AD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460efebc016f7.76730621</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has focused on understanding the sensing and signalling functions associated with SNAT2, a protein present in the surface membrane of most mammalian cells that acts as a sensor (or receptor) for external amino acids in tandem with a well-known role as a transporter of these amino acids into the cell for protein synthesis (and hence cell growth). Two important findings have emerged from the studies performed as part of this project - these are briefly outlined below. 

(i) We have discovered that modifying SNAT2 activity significantly affects how cells grow and proliferate. Specifically, we have found that sustained exposure of human breast cancer cells to a saturating or blocking dose of a non-metabolisable SNAT2 amino acid analogue (Me-AIB), leads to a marked reduction in the division and proliferation of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, despite the reduced proliferative capacity, cells treated with Me-AIB maintain their total protein content and manage to promote a marginal increase in cell size. These effects may be explained by our finding that prolonged exposure of cells to Me-AIB results in sustained activation of a key nutrient signalling axis (i.e. the mTORC1/S6K1 pathway), which crucially supports protein synthesis and cell growth. Our findings indicate that SNAT2 occupancy is somehow coupled to control of molecules that regulate protein turnover, cell division and cell growth. The precise mechanism by which such coupling occurs is currently unclear but our studies have identified two novel SNAT2-interacting proteins, MLCKII and s25, that may function in conjunction with SNAT2 to influence the activation status of downstream molecules (e.g. mTORC1) and thereby affect processes such as protein turnover, cell growth and cell division.

(ii) Another unique feature about SNAT2 biology is the finding that when cells are subjected to amino acid deprivation they substantially upregulate their expression of SNAT2. This represents an adaptive response by the cell to increase the number of membranes transporters in the face of reduced extracellular amino acid availability to help &amp;quot;scavenge&amp;quot; nutrients from an otherwise depleted environment. On resupplying amino acids to cells SNAT2 is rapidly internalised and degraded leaving only that needed to support the cells requirement. Our findings suggest that during low amino acid availability the unoccupied transporter may take on a more stabilised configuration that also signals to specific members of the cyclin dependent kinase family, which stimulate expression of the SNAT2 gene. The increased stabilisation of SNAT2 that we see in amino acid deprived cells is attributable to the N-terminal domain of the transporter which resides in the intracellular compartment. This domain contains residues that can be targeted for ubiquitination, a process that marks out the transporter for degradation by the cell's proteosome machinery. Under conditions of amino acid lack this domain adopts a configuration that resists ubiquitination and consequently the transporter is stabilised and spared from degradation. However, on resupply of substrate amino acids, we believe occupancy of the transporter by substrates induces a structural change in the carrier that exposes the N-terminus to ubiquitinating enzymes that mark the protein for proteosomal degradation. In essence, the expression and presence of SNAT2 in the membrane is regulated through its own sensing/signalling functions, which, in turn, will affect the capacity with which other cellular processes (e.g. mTORC1 signalling, protein synthesis, cell growth) are affected.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In addition to amino acids, our work during this research project also identified that proteosomal loss of SNAT2 could be enhanced by increased availability of unsaturated fatty acids as might be encountered, for example, during obesity (due to increased fat intake) or starvation (due to increased lipolysis). Our analysis reveals that SNAT2 is likely to be one of many cellular proteins ubiquitinated in response to increases in unsaturated fatty acids which &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot; the carrier for proteosomal degradation. Indeed, evidence exists in the literature showing that fatty acids (e.g. oleic acid and linoleic acid) stimulate proteolytic activity in muscle and promote proteasomal degradation of both membrane (e.g. CD36, tyrosinase) and cytosolic proteins (e.g. fatty acid synthase). In our original BBSRC application we had contended, based on previous work, that SNAT2 stabilization and turnover at the plasma membrane involved the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and that SNAT2 ubiquitination was mediated by the E3 ligase Nedd4.2. The work we have carried out as part of this project indicates that whilst MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, halts the loss of SNAT2 triggered by fatty acids, cellular silencing of Nedd4.2 fails to protect against linoleic acid-induced proteosomal loss of SNAT2. This finding implies that SNAT2 ubiquitination is likely to involve an E3-ligase other than Nedd4.2. Future studies will thus need to address the identity of the E3-ligase responsible for SNAT2 ubiquitination and importantly establish how its activity may be regulated by changes in nutrient (amino acid and fatty acid) provision. 

It is also our contention the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of SNAT2 is the most likely candidate region for associating with the proteolytic machinery and therefore most likely to confer amino acid-regulated stability effects. Consistent with this idea, our work during this project has revealed that the cytoplasmic N-terminal tail of SNAT2 possesses 7 lysine residues that may potentially serve as ubiquitin conjugation sites. We have discovered that transfection of HeLa cells with a SNAT2 construct in which all 7 lysine residues are mutated to alanine results in expression of a SNAT2 protein that is constitutively more stable than wild-type SNAT2 and one that is protected against fatty acid-induced proteolysis thus supporting our proposition. It is currently unclear whether all 7 lysine residues are required to support ubiquitination of SNAT2. Consequently, future work utilising site-directed mutagenesis to establish which lysine residue(s) is/are critical for SNAT2 stability, alongside studies aiming to identify the E3-ligase that targets these residues, will help advance our appreciation of how the SNAT2 transceptor is regulated. 

Finally, our work identified MLCKII and s25 as SNAT2 interacting partners, but, as yet, the functional significance of these interactions remain unclear. Future studies will need to establish whether these interactions are regulated in nutrient-dependent manner and whether they support the sensing and/or signalling functions of the SNAT2 transporter.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>16C58DF4-C8B7-4DDA-AB2C-1E47C4AD7A7B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460eac3295e68.76670282</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As part of our approach to study aspects of SNAT2 transporter stability we have generated mammalian expression constructs of SNAT2 that harbour a C-terminal V5 tag and where expression of the construct is driven by CMV promoter that lacks the typical amino acid responsive element that drives SNAT2 gene transcription in response to changes in extracellular amino acid availability. Consequently, this transporter is expressed constitutively when expressed in cells and can be detected using anti-V5 antibodies. Importantly, the expression of this construct enables manipulation of cell environment (e.g. addition of hormones, changes in nutrient availability etc) to assess how stability of V5-tagged protein is altered independently of gene transcription. 

We have also generated SNAT2-SNAT5 chimeric constructs. The latter contains the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SNAT2 fused to full length SNAT5 that has its N-terminal domain missing. The N-terminal domain of SNAT2 is thought to dictate transporter stability and by fusing it to SNAT5 the construct can be used to show such stability effects can be conferred upon a structurally related transporter that does not exhibit such stabilising properties in response to changes in nutrient availability. 

The unique stabilsing-conferring properties of the N-terminal domain of SNAT2 are thought to reside in one of seven lysine residues that potentially serve as targets for ubiquitin E3-ligase activity. Ubiquitination of one or more of these residues renders SNAT2 unstable and susceptible to degradation by the proteasome system. We have generated a SNAT2-V5 construct in which all 7 Lys residues have been mutated to an alanine. This mutated SNAT2-V5 construct is constitutively stable and so represents a useful tool when assessing stimulus-induced regulation of SNAT2 stability.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA4F518E-2B30-45F2-ADC7-CBBB6AFF3EFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The notion that the SNAT2 amino acid transporter may function as a transceptor in which it senses binding of its own amino acid substrates to regulate its own stability is a novel concept in mammalian transporter physiology. The constructs that we have generated have enabled us to demonstrate that when cells are subjected to nutrient withdrawal they can upregulate the abundance of key nutrient transporters (such as SNAT2) that help scavenge and allow take up of what limited nutrients may exist to sustain cell viability. When cells are subsequently placed in amino acid replete media the abundance of SNAT2 is down-regulated via proteosomal degradation. The constructs that we have generated have enabled us to decipher that the ability to upregulate/downregulate transporter expression in response to nutrient availability is crucially dependent on structural elements within the N-terminal domain whose exposure to molecules regulating transporter degradation is, itself, modified by substrate binding to the carrier. Such insight is now driving research aimed at understanding how interactions between nutrients and their transporters induces conformational changes in the transporter that not only signals carrier occupancy but which potentially recruits ancillary proteins that then either stabilise or target the carrier for degradation. Targeting these latter molecules may offer novel strategies by which nutrient uptake may be reduced to limit cell growth (which is of relevance to cancer biology) or alternatively enhancing nutrient uptake which may help sustain cell/tissue health and function (which may be of relevance, for example, to restrain loss of lean muscle mass, i.e. sarcopenia).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c006d83bfc95.45078331</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SNAT2-V5 constructs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or
