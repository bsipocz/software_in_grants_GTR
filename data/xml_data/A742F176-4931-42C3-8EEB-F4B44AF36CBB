international collaboration research project, which aims to investigate the challenges and difficulties that elderly consumers face during their supermarket shopping process in two different countries.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will be conducted through focus groups, user studies, questionnaires and design workshops. It will help explore the way in which supermarket service and environment design currently operates and can therefore be improved upon in order to provide a better experience to elderly consumers in the United Kingdom and China. Practically, this project intends to provide empirical evidence and practical design solutions by obtaining first-hand, accurate and comprehensive research data. Strong academic and industrial collaboration will provide a high level of international research with an excellent impact factor. The collaborators include Brunel University, Tsinghua University (China), Centre for Research on Ageing at University of Southampton, and Sainsbury?s. &lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Due to the remarkable growth of an aging population cross the world, the elderly consumer is regarded as a vital segmentation by the retail industry. Results of the proposed project will have a wide ranging impact on service design and delivery, social issues, cultural patterns of consumption and the supermarket environment in general. The chief beneficiaries of this project will be: 1) the UK and Chinese elderly consumers who use the current supermarket service within their respective countries, 2) the UK and Chinese retailers who could improve their service to this segment of the population, 3) the UK and China government service sectors which focus on supporting the senior citizens, 4) product and service designers and companies who target the elderly people as the end-users, and 5) the wider public, in the UK, China and worldwide, who will benefit, as potential 'elderly people', in 'quality of life' terms from better design in many aspects of public and private services. 
This project will establish a communication platform for the elderly consumers to present and emphasise their current needs with regards to supermarket services. Once this project has been completed, the empirical research results will present suggestions, recommendations and practical product and service design solutions. Through this process desirable positive changes to the elderly consumers' experience will be achieved. This project will generate significant attention from all areas of society from the perspective of creating increased fulfillment and independence in an ageing population. There will be increased value from both a community aspect and a financial aspect (for example, reducing the strain on social services).
This project will support retailers in developing a better understanding of the UK and Chinese older shoppers' current shopping experience and also help to improve their service to this segment of the industry, informed by innovative research. New products and service that will be produced from the project will provide practical options for the retailers to improve the store environment, objects in store and customer service details for the older consumers. The new products and service could be beneficial to the younger customers as well. 
This project will also provide a window for the UK and Chinese government service sector officers to understand the current living situations of their older residents. The results of this project will demonstrate the difficulties and challenges that the older citizens face and in turn producing practical suggestions for improvement. These outcomes will provide inspirations and insights for the government officers to blueprint a future plan of social care and service system for the older residents in the UK and China.
For product and service designers and companies who target older people as the end-user, this project will provide useful insights for them in the development of better products and services for the older population. Engagement with this project will also support the designers in improving their design research skills. 
This project will generate a long-term impact on the younger generations to project and think about their future lives and start working together to help and support the current older generation so as to develop a better social care culture for the ageing population in the community.
Research data and results generated from this project will be presented and disseminated in an accessible way to a wide variety of research users, in order to maximise impact. 1) Briefing papers for all stakeholders involved in the project; 2) project website, a variety of social media and a telephone-based 'feedback box'; 3) multiple data presentation formats for the different research users, such as elderly consumers, primary or high school students, supermarket staff and local residents; and 4) dissemination of research results in both English and Chinese languages.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234669</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Prototype designs for trolleys, shelving and smart shopping table to utilise within a supermarket environment.

The project has been running since December 2013. So far, ten focus groups have been conducted in the UK and China, that aimed to understand shopping related challenges and key human factors that influence the older customers' shopping experience. The findings have highlighted that physical strength, reflex, height, hearing, eyesight, dexterity, cognition and bodily mobility are main human factors that have great impact on older customers' shopping experience. Key shopping related challenges include: lack of shopping plan (organisation), narrow parking bays, poor signage, poor access to items on shelves, unsuitable promotions and the challenge of taking heavy shopping bags home.

In order to further explore older customers' natural shopping behaviours, a Cultural Probe Pack was designed and developed. The Culture Probe Pack provided an experimental research method used for the purpose of information collection to aid design inspiration. It is an information-gathering tool that contains a camera, Dictaphone, a diary, shopping inspection cards and other materials. This Culture Probe Pack was applied to encourage the participants to record their shopping experience within a two-month period via a diary, shopping inspections and other materials that indicated their shopping journeys in the user study. Together with direct-observation and in-depth interview, this ethnographic approach allowed the researcher and participants a longer period in exploring and collecting research data related to an older consumer's daily life. These studies have now been completed in the UK and China with 60 participants.

Based on the user study findings, a questionnaire survey that aimed to investigate older customers' shopping experience have been designed and developed. 2500 questionnaires have been distributions in Northumberland, Shropshire and West Dorset areas in the UK through multiple channels. Around 270 completed surveys have been received. The researcher is currently working on questionnaire design for the Chinese market.

With intention to promote design solutions for improving supermarket design and service for the older customers, a Design for Ageing programme has been launched with Brunel Design students. The students were briefed with research methodology and key findings by the researchers at the beginning of the programme. Following this, the students and older customers were invited to a co-design workshop to discussion shopping related challenges that older people face and how these challenges can be improved through design. As a final step, the students have submitted their design ideas, concepts and prototypes to the research team. Our industrial partner Sainsbury's have reviewed the top 10 design ideas and are currently considering investing further on the next step of research to develop the best design idea into a prototype. A similar Design for Ageing programme will be launched with design students at Tsinghua University to foster more design ideas.

At the end of the project, design exhibitions will be arranged in the UK and China to exhibit and display all developed design ideas from design students from Brunel and Tsinghua University.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) Journal publications in design, ageing and retail service research areas will develop academic knowledge on these issues and highlight opportunities for further multidisciplinary research. Other researchers will also have access to the research data through the UK Data Service, ensuring that further impact can be generated from the data collected for this project. Some journal papers have open access, which can be drawn upon by the wider public and non-profit groups for common good. 2) A number of accessible briefing papers will be prepared for those involved stakeholders such churches, ageing related charities, supermarket stores and local ageing groups. 3) A project website will provide a forum for disseminating research results in a timely manner, in advance of and publicising academic outputs. 4) The research results will be creatively presented in diverse formats in order to be disseminated with different audiences such as the older consumers, primary or high school students, supermarket staff and local residents. For example, a user-centred design project has been planned with staff and students at Winchester College. Researchers will present our research results to secondary study students as an example of user-centred design and also to provide insights for their design work. This has been arranged in earlier 2015. 5) The supermarket partner collaborating on this project will have access to research results throughout the process and be able to put that knowledge to use in developing policies and service design solutions to benefit the older shopper. Design students from Brunel University and Tsinghua University will use the research findings to develop new product and service design ideas and concepts for improving supermarket service for the older customers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>73E56106-9FE8-47E9-8426-B5A2C9B4E819</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546dc80f827645.53777352</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database captured the shopping behaviour and experience of the Chinese older supermarket consumers in their journey from home to the retail outlet.

This ethnographic user study pack is a participant driven data collection tool box that include diary, shopping inspections cards, digital camera, Dictaphone, note paper and pens. Participants can use the diary to record their daily activities that helped the researcher to develop a better understanding of older customers life style and how shopping has been positioned in their daily life. The shopping inspection cards require participants to their shopping experience with a particular store between 6-8 weeks period. For each week, the participants have been given an inspection focus such as customer service or checkout. meanwhile, for each inspection focus, the participants need to feedback from three perspectives: what are their shopping issues during inspection? how the issues can be improved and what is/are ideal situation for these issues? and how they would score shopping service with their local store. From the inspections cards, the researcher had opportunities to observe older people's shopping experience in a most natural way and via the participant's eye. Digital cameras and Dictaphones have been provided to support the participants who prefer to record their experience by visual or audio materials.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C671DFD2-11CB-4F67-9CF1-57F019875A80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This tool will be shared with other research groups and help them to explore older people's life style and daily activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56de34fe248975.65654197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Ethnographic user study pack</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>907E2561-6E65-456C-B53B-8010DF97D94F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigation of older consumers' overall shopping experience in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Society of Gerontology 43rd Annual Conference</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/821268ad0affc7257bc46eea4daf9f9c"><gtr:id>821268ad0affc7257bc46eea4daf9f9c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yin, Y.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545cf31b14cc80.78430164</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D983BF62-D709-42CF-8118-B5728A08CEE6</gtr:id><gtr:title>An exploratory study of older customers' holistic supermarket shopping experience in China</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cdcad914367bc88f2a14abd466358ecb"><gtr:id>cdcad914367bc88f2a14abd466358ecb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yin Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c70be4059295.84290376</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>585BAAD5-BF82-4026-A6E3-D272828B16DB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Silver Shoppers: investigating supermarket service for consumers aged 65+ using cultural probes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0a01b70e20bf9a0188e43592ff1fbd6"><gtr:id>e0a01b70e20bf9a0188e43592ff1fbd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yuanyuan, Y.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>16499972</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546ccb1ead5ab8.01302754</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K009648/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73304753-7B2F-432F-BACE-578EEECC772A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marketing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
