However, the excessive wealth created through this rapid economic growth has been disproportionate, affecting mostly the poorest-poor living in rural and urban areas including metropolitan cities. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The overarching aim of this project is to develop a trilateral research network engaging demographers, social statisticians and economists from Brazil, India and the UK to carry out a quantitative investigation of the extent of inequalities in access to health care, how these change over time and the associated determinants, with an emphasis on the poorest-poor segment of the population living in Brazil and India. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The changes over time will be evaluated in terms of whether the gap in health care access between the rich and poor have widened or narrowed and the differences between and within different social/wealth groups - focusing on three vulnerable populations: young children, young and adult women of reproductive ages and elderly women. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Proper comparison of the Brazilian and Indian datasets will provide evidence of how health care policies and programmes have operated and evolved over time in narrowing health inequalities between the rich and the poorest-poor. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Minas Gerais</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Center for Development and Regional Planning (Cedeplar)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Brazil-India-UK research network on health inequalities</gtr:description><gtr:id>7352A5E4-96A7-4729-8A5D-E5778010279D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is multi-disciplinary engaging demographers, social statisticians, health economists, epidemiologists, sociologists and statisticians.

Specifically the implementation of the new Mother-Child Tracking system in India under the Accredited Social Health Activists Scheme of the NRHM reviewed, identifying its strengths and weaknesses including the implications for the marginalised households.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57682a178841d7.67790862-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Research publications, research exchange (PhD researcher, post-doctoral researcher), research training workshops for early career researchers , contributed to writing research proposals, facilitated meetings with policy makers and stakeholders in Brazil and India, invited research team to international workshops and scientific panel and sustained research collaboration beyond the life of the project. The research team engaged successfully throughout the project which resulted in sharing interdisciplinary expertise, quantitative data analyses, strengthening capacity and accomplishing the outputs. The comparative analyses of the Brazilian and Indian datasets demonstrated evidence of new dimensions of inequalities in healthcare addressing different indicators at individual and health systems level. The levels of inequalities associated with health care indicators varied between Brazil and India and the gradients were found sensitive to level dependence. The project has been successful in establishing an interdisciplinary international research network engaging early, mid-career and senior researchers from Brazil, India and the UK. The team actively contributed and benefited throughout the project in knowledge transfer, scientific discussions, quantitative data analyses and strengthening research capacity. The network focused its efforts on strengthening quantitative research skills by engaging early career researchers in research training and providing opportunities to lead research papers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The project was successful in facilitating multidisciplinary research collaboration engaging researchers from the UK, Brazil, India and Portugal. The collaboration was instrumental in generating high quality research outputs which contributed to wider academic and social impact. The project
coordinated dissemination and impact events in Brazil, India and the UK, enabled leadership to forming a new Scientific Panel for the International Union for Scientific Studies on Population, facilitated successful research exchange between India and the UK, UFMG and Southampton, UFMG and Portsmouth, India and Portsmouth, UFMG and LSE, UFMG and Institute for Social and Economic Change (India). The collaboration contributed significantly to analysing large-scale cross-sectional data from India and Brazil, produced 2 research reports and 6 research papers of which 4 were published in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the collaboration was able to develop 4 research proposals, of which two were successful. The partnership expanded its research activities to include: Jos&amp;eacute; G.

13. Field study (health institution visits) in India and Brazil to triangulate quantitative evidence from cross-sectional data with qualitative evidence: Brazil (Maternidade (maternity services) Odete Valadares; Posto de Sa&amp;uacute;de (Health Post) S&amp;atilde;o Jos&amp;eacute; Oper&amp;aacute;rio and Granja de Freitas region in Minas Gerais); and in India (Belaku Trust NGO engaged in community health interventions involving auxiliary nurse-midwives; primary health centre and a secondary-level sub-district hospital in Kanakapura Taluk of Karnataka) facilitated policy-oriented research discussions with health officials and local administrators, addressing wide ranging issues related to health care inequalities and on the extent of service coverage and healthcare use amongst the poorest-poor under the SUS and NRHM. Specifically the implementation of the new Mother-Child Tracking system in India under the Accredited Social Health Activists Scheme of the NRHM reviewed, identifying its strengths and weaknesses including the implications for the marginalised households.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57682a178841d7.67790862-6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Research publications, research exchange (PhD researcher, post-doctoral researcher), research training workshops for early career researchers , contributed to writing research proposals, facilitated meetings with policy makers and stakeholders in Brazil and India, invited research team to international workshops and scientific panel and sustained research collaboration beyond the life of the project. The research team engaged successfully throughout the project which resulted in sharing interdisciplinary expertise, quantitative data analyses, strengthening capacity and accomplishing the outputs. The comparative analyses of the Brazilian and Indian datasets demonstrated evidence of new dimensions of inequalities in healthcare addressing different indicators at individual and health systems level. The levels of inequalities associated with health care indicators varied between Brazil and India and the gradients were found sensitive to level dependence. The project has been successful in establishing an interdisciplinary international research network engaging early, mid-career and senior researchers from Brazil, India and the UK. The team actively contributed and benefited throughout the project in knowledge transfer, scientific discussions, quantitative data analyses and strengthening research capacity. The network focused its efforts on strengthening quantitative research skills by engaging early career researchers in research training and providing opportunities to lead research papers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The project was successful in facilitating multidisciplinary research collaboration engaging researchers from the UK, Brazil, India and Portugal. The collaboration was instrumental in generating high quality research outputs which contributed to wider academic and social impact. The project
coordinated dissemination and impact events in Brazil, India and the UK, enabled leadership to forming a new Scientific Panel for the International Union for Scientific Studies on Population, facilitated successful research exchange between India and the UK, UFMG and Southampton, UFMG and Portsmouth, India and Portsmouth, UFMG and LSE, UFMG and Institute for Social and Economic Change (India). The collaboration contributed significantly to analysing large-scale cross-sectional data from India and Brazil, produced 2 research reports and 6 research papers of which 4 were published in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the collaboration was able to develop 4 research proposals, of which two were successful. The partnership expanded its research activities to include: Jos&amp;eacute; G. Dias (ISCTE-Instituto Universit&amp;aacute;rio de Lisboa, Lisbon) who contributed to research training workshops on the measurement of health care inequalities; invited Population Research Centre of the University of Groningen to develop a joint research council funded India-Europe research network proposal and the Poverty and Sexual and Reproductive Health Network involving researchers from LSE, Loughborough, Hull, Warwick and INDEPTH.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>107290</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>IndiaEurope NWOESRCICSSR Networking Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ES/K005979/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>62676E60-E5FA-40FB-8F4A-90D3EF9B74C6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>57687c86d7ad28.32150862</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has successfully achieved the intended objectives including research networking, quantitative training and proposal development events in Brazil (June 2010), India (January 2011) and the UK (May 2011). The comparative analyses of the Brazilian and Indian datasets demonstrated evidence of new dimensions of inequalities in healthcare addressing different indicators at individual and health systems level. The levels of inequalities associated with health care indicators varied between Brazil and India and the gradients were found sensitive to level dependence. The findings showed the trade-off between quantity and quality in healthcare access and associated inequalities between (horizontal) and within (vertical) socioeconomic groups. The comparisons highlighted best practice models, policy gaps and areas for programme intervention in Brazil and India. Poorest-poor disadvantage in healthcare access was accentuated more in India than in Brazil, in terms of equity, coverage and scale. Andrade et al. (Health and Place, in-press) showed that inequalities in essential diagnostic/medical care during pregnancy were minimal in Brazil whereas in India the uptake was geographically restricted with substantial inequalities. Singh et al. study (PLoS one, 2012,7(5) concluded distinctly low uptake of postnatal services for homebirths, with significant rich-poor differences. Channon et al. (Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine, 75(12):2394-402) demonstrated evidence that, unlike India, the economic inequalities in the probability of care and hospital stay among elderly were minimal in Brazil. Leone et al. (Maternal &amp;amp; Child Health Journal, conditionally-accepted) concluded high burden of maternal health care expenditure in Indian households, Pallikadavath et al. showed inequalities uneven distribution of health workers for maternal-child health services within and between health sub-centres. Other four comparative papers showed evidence of inequities in public spending (Leone et.al), socioeconomic inequalities in public sector sterilization (Caetano et al) and clinical contraceptive use (Padmadas et al).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings had objectively verifiable impact in engaging health officials, health service providers and local administrators of the health institutions during field evaluations in Brazil and India. The comparison of Brazil and India was crucial in understanding the economic impact of universal healthcare policy or Sistema &amp;Uacute;nico de Sa&amp;uacute;de (SUS) in Brazil and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in India. The research network events in Brazil and India contributed to promoting the scientific relevance and timeliness of the topic on health care inequalities to a wider community involving academics and policy makers in Brazil and India. Both network events included a field visit to selected health institutions in Brazil and India which enabled the project team to identify the gaps in service provision as well as provided an opportunity to share experiences. The network event in India included a three days quantitative methods research training workshop for early- and mid-career researchers in India. The workshop provided opportunities for research consultation and scientific interaction with participants, which generated wider knowledge and relevance of research on health inequalities. The benefits and impact of wider knowledge transfer were confirmed through a formal evaluation of research training workshops.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FB5D862E-E1FC-41B5-B804-DF016D8211DB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>57687a1aa4cc26.60031504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk/grants/RES-238-25-0009/outputs/read/fc66c0e9-a29e-4ece-9c98-d0f6ef0751c6</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0DCDACF-41C4-45FC-A6E7-85F750785CA6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Socio-economic inequalities in the use of postnatal care in India.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/62669b53e98481724294af0f7a2ae396"><gtr:id>62669b53e98481724294af0f7a2ae396</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Singh A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc009c009a936ab</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>53CBC7F2-A2D6-4EC7-B228-F5C08292E89D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inpatient care of the elderly in Brazil and India: assessing social inequalities.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social science &amp;
