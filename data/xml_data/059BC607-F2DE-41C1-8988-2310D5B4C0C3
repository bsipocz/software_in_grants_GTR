Almost 300 million individuals worldwide are affected
by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is predicted to be the third-leading cause of death by 2020. Drugcontaining
aerosols are the gold-standard therapy in the treatment of OLDs. Drug delivery to the deep lung remains an
unmet challenge using existing products. A key challenge to be addressed is the requirement for delivery of an aerosol that
targets the diseased airways and minimizes throat deposition, the most frequent cause of side-effects from inhalation
therapy.
Existing inhaled therapies have several drawbacks:
1. Nebulizer formulations are suitable for patients with severe OLDs, but they are expensive, difficult to operate, require
electricity and are usually non-portable;
2. Pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) produce aerosols with a size suitable for targeting the diseased airways
deep in the lung, but are difficult to use correctly, are only suitable for delivering small doses, and between 30 - 60 % of the
drug deposits in the throat;
3. Most dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are passive devices where drug is aerosolized under the force generated when the
patient inhales through the device. OLD patients are often unable to inhale with sufficient force to generate an aerosol
suitable for deposition in the target affected airways, rather than in the upper airways;
4. It is complex to achieve uniformity of dose content and homogeneous lung dosing when manufacturing DPIs, particularly
for high dose drugs such as antibiotics. Advanced formulation and device engineering are required to achieve manufacture
of functional DPI products. Effective devices often require energy input such as electromechanical force, or compressed
air.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research has the goal of improving our understanding of drug delivery to the lungs. This will have significant impact on
global pharmaceutical regulation by addressing several knowledge gaps currently hindering successful assessment and
introduction of rival (but bioequivalent) generic inhalation products that will decrease the costs of patient care. It is
anticipated that the translation of the findings into a clinically-exploitable inhaler device could lead to impacts in the
treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory infection. Pharmacotherapy of
obstructive lung diseases (OLDs), although successful, has failed to advance significant improvements in mortality and
morbidity [1]. Considerable societal and economic impacts could be advanced by improving clinical treatments.
Societal:
Asthma and COPD are significant causes of mortality and morbidity in the UK with far-reaching societal impacts. In the UK
alone, 900,000 individuals were diagnosed with COPD in 2004 [2] and almost 30,000 people in the UK died from COPD
conditions in 2010 [3]. As a global problem, COPD is expected to be the third-leading cause of death by 2020 [4]. An
estimated 300 million individuals worldwide are affected by asthma [5], 5.2 million people in the UK alone [7]. Worldwide,
asthma deaths are predicted to exceed 180,000 per annum [6]. Poor management of OLDs has an enormous effect on the
well-being of sufferers and the community. 250 million disability adjusted life years are lost to poorly-controlled asthma [5],
whilst 25 % of asthma patients in Western Europe require an emergency doctor's visit every year [8]. Poorly-controlled
COPD results in 1-in-8 hospital admissions [9]. In all, OLDs are associated reduced quality of life including joblessness
[10], loss of earnings [11], impaired study performance, exercise tolerance and socio-sexual relationships [12]. Translation
of improved drug delivery technologies into the clinic after this programme would lead to improved quality of life for many.
Economic:
Treatment costs to the health service and the wider economy of ineffective management (including hospitalisation) have
been estimated. The combined direct and indirect cost of COPD to the National Health Service is &amp;pound;1 billion per annum [2],
whilst the costs of asthma were estimated at &amp;pound;750 million [9]. The impact on the wider economy is also substantial: 21.9
million workdays were lost in 1994-5 due to COPD [2], and 12.7 million workdays are lost annually to asthma symptoms at
an estimated economic cost of &amp;pound;1.2 billion [7]. It is clear improvements in clinical treatments could bring significant
economic gain.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>138753</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N510087/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
