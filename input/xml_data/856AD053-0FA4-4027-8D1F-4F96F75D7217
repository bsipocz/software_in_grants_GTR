For example, to catch a cricket ball requires anticipation of the speed and direction of travel of the ball. But do elite cricketers have superior vision than sub-elites? Does having 'excellent' vision go hand-in-hand with elite sporting ability? And if elites do have superior vision than non-elites, is this the cause or a consequence of their exceptional ability? These are the questions that are of interest to us in this research project.
From a review of 'popular' sports literature, it appears that two beliefs are commonly held, first, that athletes have superior use of their vision than non-athletes and second that vision therapy improves sporting performance. However, neither of these holds up under scientific scrutiny. Previous research has dismissed the influence of visual factors, but we suggest this is because others did not use the right tests: tests that measure visual brain function, not simply eye function. Our research will establish whether elite sporting performance is linked to visual abilities determined by brain functioning in vision-specific brain areas, and, if the two are linked, to examine how they are linked. Previous research in another elite population (pilots) shows that some laboratory measures of vision are linked to flying performance whereas clinical visual measures do not.
We will assess vision and visuo-motor skills in elite- and club-level cricketers and in novices. We have selected cricket because of the complexity of its visual demands. However, our results will generalise to other sports, particularly those with a fast-moving ball (e.g. tennis). We have established links with the England &amp;amp; Wales Cricket Board and with a centre of cricketing excellence and both will provide us with access to elite players for testing. 
We will develop and run behavioural tests designed specifically to measure visual brain function. Studies of brain imaging tell us about brain functioning and connections between processing networks, but it is only feasible to study a small number of elite athletes using this approach. Our proposed behavioural studies thus offer a more practical approach to studying visual and fine-motor control abilities in elite athletes.
We will measure visual abilities in situations that mimic the sporting environment; for example, we will test the ability to see and discriminate motion and depth, and test the ability to anticipate the future location of a moving object. We will relate these vision measures to performance on a cricket task (one-handed catching) and to a more general hand-eye co-ordination task (pointing). We have infra-red motion-capture camera systems that allow limb and body movements to be carefully measured and monitored when a real-world task (e.g. catching a ball ejected from a machine) is undertaken. Thus, in addition to measuring visuo-motor task success (e.g. proportion of balls caught) we will establish the movement control parameters for individual sportspeople as they perform these tasks. 
To ensure that we fully reveal the extent of the links between visual ability and the fine-motor control required in sport we will examine individual differences in vision between good and poor ball catchers under optimal visual conditions and when vision is degraded (e.g. low light levels) because it is here where the impact of vision-related differences may emerge or be exaggerated. 
Although the focus here is to understand the link between visual and motor abilities in high-performance sport our results will hold direct relevance to everyday scenarios where visual perceptual skills limit motor control as we interact with the environment around us. Thus we aim to identify the nature of the relationship between visual and motor capabilities using elite sport as a vehicle for understanding how perception and action are linked in more everyday tasks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our understanding of visual brain processing has made major advances in recent years and yet, we are still a long way from understanding how visual neural processing limits fine-motor control as we interact with the environment around us. Such neural processing limitations will be particularly important where humans operate at the limit of their motor abilities and one such area is in elite sport. Elite versus non-elite differences in anticipatory skills have consistently been reported. However, there are unsubstantiated claims that these differences stem from an underlying superiority in the visual processing capabilities of elites. Past research in sportspeople has relied upon the use of standard clinical measures of vision. We argue that these are not sufficient to test specific neural visual function, and propose tests that will probe visual brain processing in detail, in participants with skills levels ranging from novice to elite. Interestingly, associations between military flying performance and laboratory, but not clinical, tests of vision have previously been reported. Our visual measures will include speed and motion discrimination, and tests of stereovision, and time-to-contact and flow parsing for dynamic targets. We will relate performance on these tests to catching performance for which we will have success measures and kinematic data. We start by examining the link between visual and catching ability under optimal viewing conditions but will repeat both the sensory and visuo-motor testing under conditions of degraded vision if differences in visual ability between good and poor catchers are not apparent with full vision. To assess the generalizability of our findings we will compare visual performance with that of a generic (pointing) task. Our aim is to characterise the nature of the relationship between visual sensory and visuo-motor behaviour using elite sport as a vehicle for the assessment of more general neural perception and action links.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most immediate impact of our results/conclusions is likely to be felt in the sport of cricket whose
players will have participated widely in our research, and this impact will be generated irrespective
of the outcome of our experiments. If we do reveal links between measures of vision and visuomotor
performance, the potential impact upon this sport could be that detailed assessments of visual
performance helps to predict those who have elite potential and, following on from this, that vision
training offers a means to further improve performance. The same could potentially apply to many
other sports, in particular, fast-moving/ball-sports where visual demands are, as in cricket, exacting.

If, on the other hand, it transpires we find no evidence that excellent vision contributes to sporting
excellence there will again be an important impact because there are many extant, but currently
unsubstantiated, claims that vision training offers a means for enhancing performance in high-level
sportspeople. Should it emerge that visual and sporting abilities are not linked, these claims would be
seriously challenged and the very basis for vision training in sport would be undermined.

As well as sport-related tasks, our experiments include the generic visuomotor task of pointing. Should
we find links between visual abilities and performance on the pointing task, there is potential for our
research impact to extend well beyond high-level sport. For example, our results could have substantial
impact in more everyday situations, for example in training/selecting individuals who would be suitable
to carry out fine-motor control tasks on a production line, or in scenarios where vision is below normal
or visuomotor control is reduced (e.g. by ageing). For these reasons, our potential stakeholders come
from a wide variety of backgrounds, both within and outside the domain of sport.

As well as presentation to scientific audiences (conference presentations and peer-reviewed
publications), we will disseminate our results to the clinical and sport-science communities, to our
stakeholders (real and potential) and to the general public. To disseminate our findings as widely as
possible, and to engage with actual and potential stakeholders we will:

(i) Present our results at national and international conferences on vision &amp;amp; neuroscience,
optometry/ophthalmology and sport science.
(ii) Publish our results in high-impact, peer-review journals, in particular journals with a multi-
disciplinary readership.
(iii) Post the most salient findings from our research on discussion forums/interest groups
frequented by vision scientists, sports scientists and clinicians.
(iv) Design a stand/display that will be used at public engagement events such as the British Science
Festival and at public events/open days held at our universities.
(v) Invite representatives from all stakeholder groups to the University of Bradford for a workshop
that will run in the final three months of the grant. The purpose will be showcase our results
and to explore potential for application and exploitation of our findings.
(vi) Host a workshop at a national sports science conference in the final year of the project. The aim
will be to ensure maximum exposure of our findings to the sports science community so as
to enhance the likelihood of application and exploitation.
(vii) Disseminate findings to under-graduate and post-graduate students on relevant study
programmes at our institutions so as to ensure that we fulfil our commitment to provide
research-led teaching.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>461966</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Psychology Birmingham</gtr:department><gtr:description>ViiHM network: Visual image interpretation in humans and machines</gtr:description><gtr:id>22DCC991-FFAC-425A-9DF9-B582739ECFC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a5843b231a6.96846138-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>A network funded by EPSRC -- Schofield at Birmingham is the PI</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>EPSRC funded network, I am a member.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Minho</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Portugal, Portuguese Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Portuguese Referees Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>88F55460-D4AD-45C8-89FA-FC0FB2B4E57D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of paper at the &amp;quot;First International Conference on the Science and Practice of Sports Refereeing&amp;quot;, 22nd-24th June 2014, Clermont-Ferrand, France.

As part of our data gathering exercise (now completed) we tested elite level participants from a variety of sources and sports. We tested the highest-level male cricketers from Universities in the north of England and the majority of England women's first team who had prior to their participation with us been involved in their Ashes series with their Australian counterparts. In addition, we tested a large sample of elite-level, professional rugby league players (Huddersfield Giants). In total we gathered data from over 100 participants, including age- and gender-matched control groups against whom our elite-level groups will be compared.

Presentation of Results at National &amp;amp; International Conferences:
To date we have made 6 presentations of our results. These include presentations at national and international conferences of vision science(European Conference of Visual Perception, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology and national conferences) and of sports science (British Association of Sports and Exercise Science).
Publication of Results in High-Quality, Prominent Peer-Review Journals

We have not yet submitted any papers for publication. This is because data gathering was only completed in November, 2015. We are now analysing our data and expect to make 3 submissions within the next 6 months.

Engagement activities:
A wide range of engagement activities has been pursued, including:
-Participation in the British Science Festival : We held an event (presentation followed by workshop) at the British Science Festival in September 2015. This event attracted a large volume of media interest (written and audio/radio) [see &amp;quot;engagement activities&amp;quot; section of the ResearchFish submission]
-Other presentations: Several other 'engagement' presentations have been made (e.g. to the optical profession, and to the sports science community) and an article about our research aims and project was also published in an optical trade magazine. 
-Links with stakeholders: The PI has several meetings with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and with other sporting bodies (e.g. Huddersfield Giants) about the project and about initial findings. In addition, the PI has participated in an ECB working group, the result of which was the emergence of the standards for the frequency and content of eye examinations to be conducted in cricketers.

-BBSRC promotional video. The BBSRC made a video about our project when they visited to coincide with testing of the England Ladies Cricket team in September 2015.

-Based upon our findings that basic visual anomalies are common in high-level cricketers, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) set up a working group to agree policy on the frequency of eye examination for players and the investigations and tests that should form part of these examinations. The PI was a leading member of the group that produced this policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CC2C0561-F787-4924-B2FD-4DFEC5608454</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d1c9a30f64f5.42397268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The following represent out findings to date:
-Correctable visual problems are common in elite sports people. We have gathered data to examine the effect of refractive correction on visuomotor and psychophysical test performance.
-Reaction times are faster in sports-people but this is not linked to better control of their eye positioning.
-The ability to predict when moving targets will contact with stationary or other moving targets is not linked to elite sporting behaviour.
-For our novel prediction motion tasks our results will require explanations that differ from those which successfully account for results in classic prediction motion tasks.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to say at this point. Vision training is the obvious place where there could be a potential application for this research. In cricketers, our findings that elites athletes commonly have correctable visual loss has already led to recommendations about the value of frequent, routine eye examinations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>30A32B6B-4C8D-419C-AD00-7B54661586DF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546201d08f6563.21945949</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B1C1DF1F-A0FB-4759-87FD-F8CBF6A2B6FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Visuo-motor delay in fast and slow ball sports</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dd93d4ea7381712db4f4c1af8c67560a"><gtr:id>dd93d4ea7381712db4f4c1af8c67560a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beebe NC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d1c28fe25ab4.67317187</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71A70412-5747-4C97-A26F-62991637F8FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reaction times in elite athletes and the influence of saccades</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c98f821066ad83d59dd3b12e9bee9f98"><gtr:id>c98f821066ad83d59dd3b12e9bee9f98</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barrett BT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d1c825915c81.66870952</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>859175CE-66AB-48B3-B353-C3E22E3C5566</gtr:id><gtr:title>Vision and fine-motor control in high-level cricketers</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/79d7157c0866453a2beb8b7178af0152"><gtr:id>79d7157c0866453a2beb8b7178af0152</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beebe, NC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545cf7277189a5.31190415</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4EE17971-FB32-4E01-9C80-13CD478FCA13</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relationship between reaction time and ball catching in vision-restricted conditions in elite sportspeople</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd8044ce5ce510e587f2800b242c2abc"><gtr:id>bd8044ce5ce510e587f2800b242c2abc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cruickshank, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d1c11a976354.12699120</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7FB7C47E-75DF-4EDC-B2B8-06E7B7682559</gtr:id><gtr:title>Vision and Visual History in Elite/Near-Elite-Level Cricketers and Rugby-League Players.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sports medicine -
