Three years later, the prince, renamed Kulottunga ('Lofty in his Family') controlled the largest and most powerful territorial state in southern Asia, and had assumed the dignity of the title Emperor of the Triple World. Over the course of the half-century of his rule, Kulottunga's Cola kingdom (in what are now the Indian states of Tamilnadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh) was to witness enormous transformations in its politics, society, statecraft, and literary and religious culture; the first intimation of many of these changes can be seen in the events of his coming to power and in the retrospective imagination of these events. 1070 marked, in a very real sense, as significant an historical watershed in south India as 1066 proved to be in England.

The received understanding of Kulottunga's rise to power explains it with reference to his maternal ancestry--the future king's mother and grandmother were both sisters of Cola emperors--seeing in this a reflex of the well-known Dravidian pattern of cross-cousin marriage. This genealogical explanation rests on a very impressive piece of historical reconstruction accomplished early in the last century. Sifting through the limited evidence then available, a narrative emerged: the upstart from the distaff line suddenly appeared on the scene, possibly killing his cousin, the heir apparent, in the process. It made for a compelling story, and has been repeated ever since; but solely relying on this genealogical explanation fails to do justice to the surviving record. 
 
The first part of this study reconstructs the network of political alliances struck between the future Kulottunga and a coterie of lords from the restive north of the Cola kingdom which actually made the accession possible. The rise of these northern lords fundamentally altered the elite politics of the kingdom (their descendants hastened its dissolution a century later); Kulottunga won them to his cause through offers of patronage, but also through the beguilements of eulogistic poetry and the esoteric appeal of royal Tantric ritual worship. 

The second part of the study looks at the literary representations of Kulottunga's accession produced by his contemporaries: a Sanskrit verse biography of a rival king, a collection of interrelated copperplate charters (again, in Sanskrit) issued by two of his sons, and a Tamil courtly entertainment composed late in his own reign; the first and the last of these are acknowledged masterpieces of medieval Indian literature. The central task here is a close reading of each of these texts, capturing the way that the reimagined versions of the event were integrated into the aesthetic and political project embodied in each text.

The third and final part of the study looks at the consequences of Kulottunga's rule within a single local society, centered on the great temple-city of Cidambaram (the earthly home of Nataraja, the celebrated Dancing Siva). This micro-region was transformed as a direct result of Kulottunga's emergence and the rise of his political network. The earliest royal orders bearing the king's imperial title were issued from the temple complex, while the temple's own inscriptional record begins in earnest with commemorations of several spectacular grants made by his family members and a lord with ambiguous loyalties. The royal accession also prompted a narrative reimagining in a local collection of temple legends, where it was transformed into a mythic charter for the foundation of the temple and its Brahman aristocracy. By focusing in on this one particular society, we can trace the ways that local people adapted the events of grand politics to their own needs and purposes, while also tracing the way they were bound up in the designs of the kingdom-wide elite.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary outputs of this project will consist of a monograph and several associated academic articles. Although the monograph will have a primarily South Asian Studies academic readership, it will be intentionally structured to be accessible to as wide an audience as possible, inclusive of non-specialist academic readers and the large and interested readership in English-literate audiences in India and in the Asian diaspora in Britain, Europe, and North America. One of the book's larger purposes is to bring the cultural heritage of South India to this wider public, one that is often excluded by language barriers and by the inaccessible style of Indological research and translation. While the field of Indology is flourishing in the quality and technical sophistication of its research, these successes have been to the exclusion of more broadly accessible, synthetic works that bring together monographic research and identifiable 'big picture' research questions in a coherent narrative: this is something this project would seek to rectify. One aspect of this work is thus a kind of cultural connoisseurship; but this needs to be seen alongside another, wider purpose, that of initiating a field-leading discussion on the nature of the premodern Indian polity, and introducing this cultural archive to an audience that would not normally look to early India for material. This latter group includes academic colleagues such as specialists in politics and political philosophy, but also participants in the international third sector of NGOs, which have a strong presence in southern India. As the Indian national conversation on the nature of institutional life has risen to international prominence (as seen especially in the Anna Hazare movement), questions of the long term nature of public power and legitimacy have rarely been as prominent in national and international understanding of India; at a time when the UK is actively fostering its cultural and economic ties with India, a look into the past is something of value to policy makers, potential investors, and interested citizens alike. Given this potential interest beyond the community of academic researchers, I aim to secure as wide a dissemination of the work among identified beneficiaries. A long term goal will be the translation of the work into Tamil, opening up another (academic and nonacademic) audience. In order to secure as large an English-reading audience as possible, I intend to use a number of different approaches. I have strong personal and professional connections with media professionals and cultural institutions in the cities of Chennai, Pondicherry, and Mysore, and I will give public lectures and interviews on the topic there; this is something that I have done in the past, in English and Tamil. I also plan to deliver lectures at the University of Delhi, thus introducing my research in the literary and cultural as well as political capital of India. In Britain, in addition to the research seminar presentations I will continue to give on the subject, I plan to arrange lectures with the help of colleagues at the British Museum, the Royal Asiatic Society, the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, and the Nehru Centre, thus accessing the many different constituencies interested in India that are based in London.

Identified non-academic potential users:
-the English-literate readership in India, and potentially a Tamil readership as well
-the Indian heritage and tourism industries (tour operators, hoteliers, travel writers) 
-the Archaeological Survey of India
-Curators and museum professionals (India and UK)
-policy-makers, NGO workers and professionals interested in the long-term history of Indian public life

My research has already attracted interest from students in India, some of whom I hope will come to SOAS to study. This will have a direct economic benefit in the short term, but will also foster longer term linkages between India and Britain.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64532</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J00698X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>18BE3C84-714B-4BEC-A5E9-B1F27D03EA79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asiatic &amp; Oriental Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C97D3463-9A59-45DF-A24C-739A3B93B405</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigraphy &amp; Papyrology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>579CC04C-737A-43C0-AA54-29DF21AF2C4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hinduism</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
