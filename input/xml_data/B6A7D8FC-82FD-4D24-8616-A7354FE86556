Previous research by the grant holders in 2011 produced three results of great relevance to the present political situation. First, Egyptian public opinion appeared overwhelmingly supportive of democracy. Second, differences between supporters of different parties were minimal. A third feature of public opinion, however, illustrated clearly the nature of the country?s current democratic cross-roads because in 2011 there were strong levels of support for a ?guardian army? among supporters of all parties.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Clearly, Egyptian public opinion cannot now hold on the lines of 2011. But, in what directions is it breaking? The answers may be crucial to the democratic future and governability of the country. The project will conduct two nationally representative samples of Egyptians, and using the data, the project will inform beneficiaries about the democratic commitments of Egyptian citizens and will create a new and unique publicly-accessible survey database that can be a basis and anchor for further academic research on Egypt.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate and medium-term future of Egypt is of considerable importance to the democratic development and security of the Middle East. The aim of the research is to contribute to knowledge about the contemporary political situation in Egypt in order to shed light on the possible trajectories of the country's regime development and political stability. The beneficiaries of the research, therefore, are all those - national government officials and policy makers, NGO's, opinion leaders and the public in general - who have an interest and stake in understanding Egypt's political trajectory. They will benefit from the research through consumption of the academic outputs and publications, engagement of the investigators with stakeholders through various outlets - interactive blog discussion, symposia and conferences, presentations and briefings to officials and the press, and through the public availability of the data on the completion of the project. 

Specific beneficiaries include:
- The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with which we have contact through HM Ambassador to Egypt James Watt.
- The UK Ministry of Defence, with which we have contact via Lt-General Simon Mayall, Defence Senior Advisor to the Middle East.
- The UK Department for International Development, with which we have contact through Sam Grout-Smith of the Arab Partnerships project at the British Embassy in Egypt.
- Egyptian and international media and newspapers, including Al-Hayat TV Network, Shorouk, Wall Street Journal, USA Today.
- British businesses with interests in Egypt and the broader Middle East who wish to understand the direction in which Egyptian public opinion is heading. We will engage with The British Egyptian Business Association, based in Cairo, with which we have contact through Executive Director Nadia Lamloum. We will also engage with the British Chamber of Commerce, with which we have contact through the Chief Executive, Dr Afnan al-Shuaiby.
- Financial and investment organizations with strategies in the region,. These include Chris Rokos, founding partner of the hedge fund Brevan Howard (who funded our 2011 survey) and Olivier Meyohas, Managing Director at Blackstone.
- Consultancies and business intelligence firms with strong regional interests who may wish to feed elements of our results to their clients. We would send briefings to firms such as Hakluyt, GPW, MENAS Associates, Stratfor, Observatory and Greenmantle.
- UK and international press and media, which we will contact and engage with the assistance of the Reuter's Institute for the Study of Journalism (a Centre in the Department) and the University Press Office
- The public, including citizens of the UK and Egypt and beyond, whom we will engage via the Department's highly successful blog, 'Politics In-Spires', our website where we will post working papers and the email lists and the lecture series of the British-Egyptian Society (chaired by Baroness Symons) on whose Board project collaborator, Dr Elisabeth Kendall, sits.

We anticipate, therefore, making an immediate impact by presenting key headline findings to stakeholders and via the press within four months of the project's commencement. Impact will roll out across the duration of the project, as working papers are made available online, presentations are made to stakeholders about more detailed findings, as the blog builds a readership, and via the two final conferences. The project aims to make a long-term impact by establishing a lasting network of stakeholders interested in the further political, economic and security trajectories of Egypt, through the use of the survey data that we will make publicly available and through the dissemination of results of published academic papers that will be on-going.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121554</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cairo University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Egypt, Arab Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Review of Economic and Political Science</gtr:description><gtr:id>66481600-24B9-4132-8E12-88CA720F549F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hassan, Mazen (2016) 'The Weakest Link: Structural Impediments to a Strong Parliament in Egypt', Review of Economics and Political Science.

It covers the fields of economics, political science, statistics, public administration and social science computing. It is the first English peer-reviewed social science journal in Egypt. It aims at gradually replacing the old Arabic only FEPS journal in an attempt to go international in the near future. 
In 2016, the Journal was given the highest ranking among regional journals (the region here is the Arab World) by the Egyptian Political Science Sector responsible for promotions of Egyptian political scientists to associate-professors and full professors. Titles of recent articles published by the journal include &amp;quot;The Military Coup: A Persistent Theoretical Challenge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ideological Factor in National Security Assessment?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Islamic Bonds and their Role in Economic Development&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Iranian Nuclear Agreement from A Legal Perspective&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Female Wages in the Egyptian Textiles and Clothing Industry: Low Pay and Discrimination&amp;quot;. The Journal website is http://reps.feps.edu.eg/.

Both British and Egyptian governments have engaged actively with our research results. Representatives from the FCO, DfID, the Egyptian Embassy in London and the Egyptian military participated in a 2 day seminar entitled 'Egypt and Democracy'; on 17-18 September 2014. The seminar showcased our new data relating to changing democratic attitudes in Egypt from 2011-14, as well as providing an opportunity for research beneficiaries (from academia, the public and private sectors) to present and discuss similar and alternative perspectives. Subsequently, our data presentations were sent to the British Embassy in Cairo at their request.
CULTURAL and SOCIETAL:
We have submitted and are in the final stages of approval for an article entitled 'Media, Cultural Consumption and Normative Support for Democracy in Post-Revolutionary Egypt'. The article currently has the status of resubmitted after a request for revisions in the international journal Political Studies. The article takes a highly original approach. Rather than empirically recounting and analysing cultural production that allegedly inspired, or was inspired, by Egypt's recent revolution, it attempts to quantify the impact of cultural production on support for democracy in Egypt. This analysis, even prior to publication, has also played a supportive role (via citations and comparative analysis) in two further publications that interrogate current research approaches in the fields of literature and counter-terrorism: Kendall, 'Does Literature Matter?';; (eds. Ostle, Allen, and Mustafa Badawi, Modern Arabic Literary Studies, EUP 2015); Kendall, 'Yemen's al-Qa'ida'; Poetry as a Weapon of Jihad; (eds. Kendall and Stein, Twenty-First Century Jihad, I.B.Tauris, 2014).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D287FC6E-2694-4E0F-9CDF-3208AD0633BE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546272b25154a1.07447307</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our analysis of Egyptian public opinion in 2013 compared to 2011 has revealed that very important transformations have taken place in the attitudes of Egyptians towards democracy. In 2011, democracy was most strongly supported by the educated, young people, living in urban areas, and there was no gender gap in attitudes; by 2013, exactly these sorts of people had become less supportive of democracy than others, and a large gender gap (women supporting less than men) had opened. In 2011, support for democracy was aspirational in economic terms: those who had done relatively badly in the past but who had higher hopes for the economy in future were the more likely to support; this is no longer the case by 2013. Interestingly, support for democracy in 2011 was also more likely among Islamists, who saw the possibility of achieving their agenda through the ballot box; again, this is no longer the case. The findings have clear implications for the stability of democracy in the country.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have been active in disseminating our results via a large conference and through responding to specific requests for our analysis from UK government agencies, including the FCO, Department for Defense and DfID.
