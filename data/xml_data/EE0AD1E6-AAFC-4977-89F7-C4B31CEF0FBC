They are also a foundation for many other significant mathematical theories including braid groups and Hecke algebras.The Weyl groups are particular cases of complex reflection groups, finite groups of matrices with complex coefficients generated by pseudo-reflections (elements whose vector space of fixed points is a hyperplane). Through recent work on representations of reductive groups over finite fields based upon George Lusztig's fundamental work, and motivatedby conjectures about modular representations of general finite groups, it has become clearer and clearer that the complex reflection groups behave very much like Weyl groups, and might even be as important. For example, convincing indices tend to show that, although complex reflection groups which are not Weyl groups do not define finite groups over finite fields, they might be associated to similar mysterious objects, the Spetses .The aim of my work is to find a unifying mathematical theory for the study of complex reflection groups. This theory will be used to answer important questions about the representation theory of structures associated to complex reflection groups, such as Hecke algebras and Cherednik algebras, and will lead us towards the discovery of Spetses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>204581</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings have been used by mathematicians working in the areas of representation theory, particularly that of finite groups, Hecke algebras and Cherednik algebras, algebraic combinatorics and low-dimensional topology.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BEEB4C71-4CBB-4A46-BC14-078FAD6A9F1F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56435372cbe158.86609159</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Finite Coxeter groups are finite groups of real matrices that are generated by reflections. They include the Weyl groups, which are fundamental in the classification of simple complex Lie algebras as well as simple algebraic groups. They are also a foundation for many other significant mathematical topics. Finite Coxeter groups are, however, particular cases of complex reflection groups, that is, finite groups of complex matrices generated by complex reflections. Important work in the last two decades has suggested that complex reflection groups will play a crucial, but not yet understood role in representation theory, and may even become as ubiquitous in the study of other mathematical structures. Our research has pursued this, with the aim of furthering the connections with the representation theory of finite reductive groups and Hecke algebras via the introduction of new methods from rational Cherednik algebras and their combinatorics.



Finite reductive groups are fundamental in mathematics, as they produce families of finite simple groups. Each has an associated Weyl group which controls its representation theory, and from this point of view Iwahori-Hecke algebras appear naturally as endomorphism algebras of induced representations in the study of finite reductive groups. Another point of view is to regard Iwahori-Hecke algebras as deformations of group algebras of Weyl groups, depending on a parameter q. Brou&amp;eacute;, Malle and Rouquier used this description to define Hecke algebras for any complex reflection group.



Rational Cherednik algebras are a new family of algebras associated to complex reflection groups. Their representation theory is expected to have much in common with the representation theory of simple complex Lie algebras, particularly connections to algebraic geometry and D-module theory.



Our major ambition is to develop a Kazhdan-Lusztig cell theory for complex reflection groups. Kazhdan-Lusztig cell theory for Iwahori-Hecke algebras was motivated by deep problems in Lie theory, but now has grown as a subject in its own right, playing an essential role in the representation theory of Weyl groups and finite reductive groups. A generalised Kazhdan-Lusztig cell theory is expected to help find &amp;quot;Spetses&amp;quot;, the mysterious objects generalising finite reductive groups. This has been an active area of research for a number of years, with particular progress achieved through the study of Rouquier blocks (which have been our object of study during the years before this project) and canonical basic sets (which have been our object of study during this project). 



Kazhdan-Lusztig theory yields the existence of canonical basic sets for Weyl groups in certain cases. We have managed to expand these cases and obtain canonical basic sets for almost all complex reflection groups. For this we have also used the new connections between Hecke algebras and Cherednik algebras that we developed. Further, motivated by results on Cherednik algebras, we developed a cancellation-free formula for the Schur elements of the Ariki-Koike algebra; this is important in computational algebra. Finally, we have established a canonical way to study the modular representation theory of graded algebras, which points towards the existence of several gradings on Hecke algebras.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work will benefit mathematicians working on representation theory, particularly that of finite groups, Hecke algebras and Cherednik algebras.
