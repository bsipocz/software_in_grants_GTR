Solutions of electromagnetics problems involving metamaterials are extremely important to analyze these structures and their interactions with the environment. For example, accurate solutions of metamaterial problems can provide essential information on novel designs even before their actual realizations, preventing the waste of sources and time during the manufacturing of the prototypes. Unfortunately accurate simulations of metamaterials are extremely difficult since they are composite multi-scale structures, i.e., they consist of thousands of unit cells with small details whereas their overall dimensions can be very large with respect to the wavelength. Hence, accurate numerical analysis of metamaterials using full-wave solvers may require the solution of huge matrix equations involving millions of unknowns. In addition, metamaterials are usually functional at some resonance frequencies, where the numerical solutions may become unstable. Due to the limitations in their computational solutions, metamaterials could not be investigated in sufficient depth, and most of the studies in the literature are based on approximate homogenization techniques that are unable to provide rigorous and accurate analysis of realistic structures. The purpose of this study is to develop a fast and accurate solver based on a parallel implementation of a powerful algorithm, namely, the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA), for the analysis of metamaterials. By developing a sophisticated simulation environment consisting of diverse components from different areas, such as numerical techniques, iterative method, fast algorithms, parallelization, and parallel computers, real-life problems involving complex metamaterials will be solved with unprecedented levels of accuracy and detail. In addition to academic impacts in computer science and high performance computing, the results are expected have high impacts in science and technology in a broad sense by showing the feasibility of new metamaterial designs for constructing the devices of the future's world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The parallel implementation that will be developed in this project will enable realistic simulations of metamaterials. The numerical and computational techniques, as well as the underlying theory used for the implementation, are likely to be integrated in various commercial electromagnetics software. This has been previously experienced by the applicant; some of the solution techniques developed by Ergul and his colleagues and disseminated in journal publications have been implemented by various commercial software companies in relatively short periods, e.g., 2-3 years following the publications. 
 
Accurate simulations of metamaterials are necessary to improve the engineering of these structures. Specifically, numerical solutions of these structures can facilitate design and manufacturing cycles by enabling the engineers to explore novel designs and reducing the time/expense involved in building prototypes. A reliable simulation environment can also lead to novel tracks in the design of these important structures since engineers can test challenging structures without their actual realizations. 

Design and engineering of metamaterials are important, leading to new horizons and opportunities in science, technology, and society in a broad sense. Metamaterials can be used in a vast variety of important areas, e.g., miniaturization of the antennas for smaller communication devices, constructing powerful lenses for high-resolution optical imaging systems, etc. As a long term impact, rigorous simulations of these structures that will be performed in this project can contribute to the development of the devices of the future's world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2364</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>96AF401B-DE21-4DBD-815C-BAA3C212E3C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parallel-MLFMA solutions of large-scale problems involving composite objects</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3427afc6cb298322bd24972c5a3b8cfd"><gtr:id>3427afc6cb298322bd24972c5a3b8cfd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ergul O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4673-0461-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0560565a78965</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A07B5438-A0AE-4264-B84F-D97D66E6AB44</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fast and accurate analysis of large-scale composite structures with the parallel multilevel fast multipole algorithm.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Optical Society of America.
