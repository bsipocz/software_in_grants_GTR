The presentation of a list of ordered items is often in the format of ordered sequence (from left to right). For example, the following lists show four preference orderings, produced by the four popular search engines when typing &amp;quot;London&amp;quot;, where the ordered items are the terms suggested by the search engines:
1) Bing: London tube map, London stock exchange, London weather, London underground, London eye, London zoo
2) Duckduckgo: London has fallen, London broil recipes, London king, London time, London fog
3) Google: London Weather, London tube map, London, London eye 
4) Yahoo: London underground, London tube map, London England, London weather, London eye, London Marathon 2016

Rank aggregation for preference orderings is the problem of finding a consensus ordering or consensus rank by combining the original preference orderings, and it is one of the fundamental and most common optimization problems in many AI fields. For example, in meta-search, a query is sent to several search engines, and results from the search engines are aggregated to produce a better result; in group decision making, rank aggregation can help experts adjust their preference orderings, in order to reach a better decision collectively; in crowdsourcing, where users obtain their requested services from Internet, rank aggregation has become one of the biggest challenges to combine large volumes available resources; in recommender systems, aggregating users' preferences over products has been of interest to both industry and academic researchers. 

Rank aggregation for preference orderings is also important to the other subjects, ranging from social science to bioinformatics. In social science, rank aggregation has been used to analyze life-course patterns; it is widely studied for determining the winner in competitions and social voting. In bioinformatics, researchers have used rank aggregation to analyze biomedical ordering sequences. 

 This project aims to develop efficient algorithms on rank aggregation for preference orderings by mapping preference orderings to higher dimensional spaces and by using GPU computation. In order to achieve this, this project will: (1) estimate the median for a set of preference orderings in higher dimensional spaces, because the median is an important factor for evaluating rank aggregation; (2) detect outliers from a set of preference orderings, because the consensus rank can be skewed by the outliers in preference orderings; (3) develop fast learning algorithms to aggregate preference orderings by using GPU computation, because the existing methods are computationally expensive.

The research findings from this project will be published in high-impact conferences and journals to advance the research in the area. The algorithms developed in this project will be released as open source, publicly available on github to benefit academic researchers and industrial developers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Knowledge
New algorithms will be proposed and developed for rank aggregation, which will prompt scientific advances in artificial intelligence areas and in social science. Open source of the algorithms will be made available on github, which will contribute to knowledge sharing with academic communities and industry. A new dataset will be released by the team on github, in order to benefit the researchers in the area. The team will engage with the industry, in order to transfer our knowledge to improve their products. 

2)People
A PhD student will be funded by the hosting university. The PhD student will be working alongside the PDRA in the project. Both the PDRA and the PhD student will obtain experience and skills by working with industry and attending international conferences. By engaging with the industry partner, the people in the industry will also have the opportunity to explore the latest academic research.

3) Society
Societal impact by collaboration with industry: The industry partner of British Sky Broadcasting, is keen to test and potentially to integrate the algorithms for their products. The collaboration with industry is aligned with the Royal Society &amp;quot;Future developments could support the UK economy and will have a significant impact upon society&amp;quot;. 
Societal impact by public event: the team will create a showcase for attending the annual Northern Ireland Science Festival, which has 63,000 attendees and 150 events across 30 venues, in order to reach out to the public. 


4) Economy
The impact to the economy lies in two aspects: the collaboration with industry and the open source. The team will work closely with the industry partners, and our research will potentially be integrated into their products. On the other hand, the PDRA and the PhD student, will learn the skills by working with industry, which will improve the students' employability. In industry, the rapid evolvement in IT is heavily driven by the open source, e.g, Hadoop and Spark for big data, Tensorflow for machine learning. Such evolvement, heavily driven by the open sources communities, has significant impact to the UK and global economy. We hope to be part of this process by making our research as open source.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100780</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P031668/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
