While UD has intuitive appeal, and has quickly gained global reach, even totemic status, there has been little or no evaluation of its underlying principles, its theoretical and conceptual content, or the diversity of ways in which it is interpreted and placed into practice. Rather, the preponderance of writings about UD tends to accept it as a good thing, and focus on evaluating its technical feasibility and operational outcomes (Crews, et al., 2006, Froyen, et al, 2009). The focus is the description and evaluation of the products and processes of UD, and generating an evidence base of users? interactions with their environments as the basis for product enhancement and development.&lt;br />&lt;br />While this emphasis is important, there has been little academic attention or critical scrutiny of the overarching principles of UD, how these are understood, and, subsequently, placed into practice (although, see Heylighen, 2008, Imrie, 2012, Lid, 2012). This ESRC seminar series seeks to redress these lacunae by describing and evaluating the underlying assumptions about design and embodiment shaping the content of UD, focusing on its prognosis of what ought to be done to attain an inclusive environment and how to achieve it. There will be particular emphasis on comparative understanding, of how different socio-institutional relations and contexts shape UD, the consequences for practice, and subsequent user-experiences of the designed environment.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries include:

(a). Public sector beneficiaries including local, regional and national government departments in the UK who will be able to use the seminar findings for the formulation of policy and legislation relating to design and discrimination. This includes the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department of Work and Pensions, and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. In addition, this information will be of value to the European Union, and has direct relevance for their 10 year strategy of 'breaking down barriers' (see http://ec.europa.eu/news/justice/101115_en.htm). 

(b). Third sector beneficiaries include voluntary organisations and advocacy and community groups, who will be able to use the seminar findings for advocacy and campaigning on behalf of their members and users, in relation to ensuring that the designed environment is responsive to issues of equity of access to goods and services. These include disability organisations such as RNIB and SCOPE, others such as Age Concern, Trades Unions, and community and civil groups.

(c). Service providers, such as Housing Associations, Caring organisations, NHS Trusts, etc. where the quality of life depends, critically, on design sensitised to bodily difference. One of the most important housing associations involved in UD is Habinteg and they will be integral to the seminar programme, both in advising on its content and presenting their work.

(d). Industry where product design, and the delivery of services, is increasingly required in ways whereby it is responsive to bodily diversity and capacities; UD also represents a potentially new and exciting market and can be a basis for expanding the range of product ranges and service types, and thus be a basis for industrial expansion.

(e). Designers, architects, and others involved in creative industries relating to product design, and the sensitivity of material artefacts to the complexities of bodily performance. 

The research seminars are discussing what is, arguably, one of the most vital issues of our time; that is, how to provide a material environment, including the products we use, and services delivered to us, in ways whereby independence of access to, and use of, such artefacts can be assured. UD offers the possibilities of designing places, spaces, and things in ways whereby dependence on others is minimised, thus offering potential to reduce care costs and enable people to work in ways whereby bodily differences is catered for by universally designed work spaces. UD, if developed in ways that recognises the complexities involved in designing environments, provides potential for new markets to emerge, and new creative practices relating to design.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14741</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J021601/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>4F5263FE-9174-4474-91F7-8393AECC8B98</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J021601/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>14741.28</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>4B71F972-3251-412E-AC4A-F6121EF8F2CF</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J021601/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>10600.75</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>86884005-D98A-4391-95D8-913141C39F7C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment &amp; Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
