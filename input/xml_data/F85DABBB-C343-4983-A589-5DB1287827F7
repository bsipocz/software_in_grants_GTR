Both well known texts (like Sappho 1 and 31, or Alcman 1) and less frequently studied texts (like Eumelus at the beginning and poets of the 'New Music' at the end) will be included, as will be the most recent substantial find, the 'New Sappho', which has not yet been subject of a substantial commentary. Programmatically going beyond the canonical authors, this anthology will convey an appropriately complex picture of the performance culture of the period, and work against outdated narrow impressions of the genre.
 The edition will fill a gap. The study of Greek lyric has experienced very significant developments in recent years, with new papyrus finds, a broadening of the canon, and a much fuller understanding of questions of performance, genre, religious, cultural and political history. The field has changed out of recognition since Campbell wrote in 1967 what is still the most widely used commentary in the English-speaking world, and we do not have a new commentary on a representative sample of texts which fully engages with these developments. This volume aims to provide such a commentary, combining close textual analysis with thorough consideration of the broader issues of cultural poetics that make Greek lyric such a remarkably vibrant area of research at present.
 As a result, the volume will have, above all, the following three benefits:
Firstly, it will significantly advance our understanding both of individual texts and of Greek lyric in general. Greek lyric is an unusually difficult body of texts: fragmentary, linguistically demanding, and poorly documented in contemporary sources. A good commentary, one that is in command of the detail and also uses this detail to build up larger interpretations and has an eye on broader issues, is therefore well placed to develop fresh and convincing readings in this field.
 Secondly, the edition will provide a reliable tool for researchers (scholars as well as graduate students) in the field as well as researchers in other fields, such as Greek tragedy, Latin lyric or Archaic Greek history. It will make available to them current and indeed new thinking on all aspects of the texts, ranging from issues of textual criticism, dialect and syntax to issues of pragmatics, poetics and politics, and will thus help to stimulate new research. 
 Thirdly, even though this will be a scholarly edition, presenting an untranslated Greek text and assuming knowledge of Greek in the notes, the project will open up Greek lyric - a fascinating and culturally influential corpus in its own right and a corpus that has prompted so much innovative scholarship in recent years - to non-experts, in particular undergraduates. In line with the green-and-yellow series, this edition will be fully useable by students. Certain sections, in particular the general introduction, will be accessible more widely. Finally, even though the readership of the edition itself will be academic, it will be possible to communicate some of the scholarship that goes into it through school talks and public lectures, which are proposed as some of the impact activities for this project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics series is known for serving a wide range of users. These include of course scholars and graduate students (see 'Academic Beneficiaries'), but they also include undergraduates and school pupils. Greek lyric is a linguistically difficult body of material and not part of the current school curriculum, and hence it would be wrong to hope that the commentary will be used in schools or even in lower-level undergraduate courses as widely as some of the other volumes in the series, devoted to, say, Homer or Virgil. But as set out in the 'Pathways to Impact' document, I shall work diligently, through a number of means, to make it the edition of choice for Classics undergraduates studying options in this area (and a new edition of choice is clearly needed), while not compromising its scholarly aims; and shall work diligently also to ensure that particular sections are accessible to Greek-less students and school pupils who want to learn about an aspect of Greek lyric. This will certainly be true for the general introduction; but with a degree of perseverance such students may be able to benefit also from some other sections (for instance, when studying Catullus 51 they might use the summary discussion, though of course not the detailed notes, for Sappho 31). 
 Apart from preparing a volume that may itself be used by a range or readers, I shall also engage both school pupils and wider audiences through lectures that present my work on Greek lyric in an appropriate form. In schools this often falls under 'curriculum enrichment' (see also 'Pathways to Impact' document).
 The benefit to students and other non-experts will above all be to make accessible to them, directly or indirectly, up-to-date scholarly thinking about a range of difficult but culturally significant poets. Sappho, Anacreon and Pindar have all had enormous influence on the development of western lyric, and Sappho in particular remains a fascinating figure. For several texts this is in fact the first commentary in English (Eumelus, New Sappho, Simonides 511, 'New Music').
 In addition, there is a further benefit to student users of the commentary. Exactly because Greek lyric is linguistically so challenging, a commentary that helps students engage with the difficult Greek, and helps teachers put on courses about texts with difficult Greek, also helps develop and maintain high standards of linguistic expertise. I believe firmly that this is an important reason for providing accessible commentaries on what are generally considered to be difficult texts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80105</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Several talks to non-university audiences (esp. schools, also general public)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>916C3D9F-D028-4286-887B-8E405C0A8B41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Various talks on various topic in Greek lyric (esp.
