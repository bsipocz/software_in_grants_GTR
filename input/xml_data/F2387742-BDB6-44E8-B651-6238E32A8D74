Many early mills were located in rural areas where water power could be harnessed. The Derbyshire Peak District, now partly covered by a National Park, is one such area. Amidst small towns and farmland the sites of the earliest water-powered cotton mills in the world are found, several of which form the heart of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. Yet the global connections of this important cotton textile heritage area often remain obscured. The sources of raw cotton grown in India, Egypt and on slave-worked plantations in the Americas are rarely identified. The importance of the cotton goods produced for not only domestic but colonial markets, including the slave trade and plantation supplies remain hidden. Such absences contribute to feelings of exclusion and alienation amongst Indian and African Caribbean heritage groups already poorly represented as visitors to such heritage sites and the wider countryside.

This project sets out to reconnect this important world site of industrial innovation with the people and places involved in cotton textile production in the past and now. Through examination of historical archives it will provide new information on cotton supplies and product use. It will use this new historical information to inform collaborative work with three local community-based groups from different heritage backgrounds: former Derbyshire textile workers based in Glossop, a Sheffield Hindu heritage group and an inner city Nottingham group of African Caribbean heritage. The groups will be encouraged to reflect on this new information and undertake visits to the mill sites, facilitated by the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site, to help them gain further insight into the issues. In conjunction with the project team the community groups will consider how global, diverse heritage perspectives might be better represented in the heart of the Peak District and will develop a set of materials to help do this. As well as this very local approach, the project will run an international cotton workshop, hosting cotton experts from India and the Americas, to provide new perspectives on the Peak District cotton textile industry and its heritage sites. This will be attended by academics, charities and representatives of the community groups involved in the collaborative research. Bringing people together in this way will help develop personal links between academics, third sector organisations and publics interested in the connections of cotton and with the aim of encouraging more collaborative work in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has capacity for cultural and social impact on a local, regional and national scale. In particular, it has potential for direct impact on public and third sector bodies in the Derbyshire Peak District, and community-based organisations and wider publics in the region. Through archival research and a series of community engagement, knowledge exchange and networking activities, the project will: a) Improve the effectiveness of rural heritage provision in the Peak District and so enhance cultural enrichment opportunities; b) Enhance the knowledge of public and third sector organisations concerned with preserving and communicating the Peak District's natural and cultural heritage; c) Contribute to increasing public understanding of the British countryside's global histories, and so help open up these public spaces to more diverse audiences.
To achieve this the project is collaborating with the following key stakeholders: 1) The Peak District National Park (PDNP), whose remit includes the conservation of the Park's cultural heritage, increasing public understanding of the park and fostering the social well-being of its local communities; 2) Derwent Valley Mills (DVM) World Heritage Site, a third sector organisation that manages this UNESCO World Heritage; 3) The Arkwright Society, an educational charity concerned with the conservation of industrial heritage and the built and natural landscape of Cromford; Glossop Heritage Trust, a local charity promoting the textile heritage of Glossop and responding to the interests of ex-textile workers and their families in the region; Sheffield Hindu Samaj: a voluntary group concerned with promoting Hindu faith, culture, arts and languages, raising awareness about different ethnic groups, and advancing education. The project has also engaged a community historian, Helen Bates, with significant experience of working in the East Midlands, especially with Black and Ethnic Minority (BME) communities. Drawing on her expertise and network of contacts, e.g. from the Hyson Green Nottingham Group, Bates will help facilitate engagement with Nottingham's BME communities. The activities and outputs that will help realise these impacts are set out below. The archival research into international connections of cotton supplies, products and people will directly benefit the named public and third sector bodies, as the new information will enhance the scope of heritage narratives at these sites, and thereby their appeal to more diverse audiences. This will be embedded through new exhibition panels. Both the PDNP and the DVM World Heritage Site will also benefit from the greater engagement of BME and inner city groups enabled by the project's site visits, and associated knowledge exchange. The production of heritage resources aimed at such underrepresented audiences will also benefit these non-HEIs in terms of attracting wider audiences, including BME and international visitors. This will be helped by the project's marketing scheme, targeting national organisations such as the Black and Asian Studies Association and the Black Cultural Archives.
The community workshops and site visits will directly benefit the community groups working with the project, as they will be designed to respond to their interests, e.g. in terms of particular connections to textile mills and global histories. Additionally, the opportunity for knowledge exchange and the co-production of heritage resources will offer participants a voice in their own heritage and community narratives. More indirectly, wider publics including BME groups in Nottingham and Sheffield will benefit from the project's outputs, which will communicate the new heritage and community narrative about the Peak District's international connections to cotton, including those related to slavery and colonialism, in an accessible way. This will include the new heritage resources in situ but also digital and social media outputs, eg blog pages, community films.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>42416</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This short film entitled 'Global Cotton Connections - Untangling the Threads of Slavery' has been produced by the Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies group, made up of people of mainly African Caribbean heritage backgrounds, drawing on its involvement in the Global Cotton Connections project.

Specific challenges the day sought to address were: how can the achievements of a project be sustained and built upon after the main period of funding has ended? how can people brought together through a particular project continue their collaboration? how can the resources/materials generated be effectively managed into the future? The strategy was to bring together a range of people interested in Black heritage research to share and discuss the work they have undertaken so far, including collaborations involved, the challenges faced and successes achieved, and ways of moving forward. The workshop included sessions on sharing past achievements in which six people/groups presented (some academic, some community), discussing experiences, successes and challenges of university-community collaborations, sharing ideas on sustaining and managing people and resources beyond project funding, sharing new research ideas and suggesting ways forward. The format was designed to allow participants to engage actively in presentations and smaller-scale discussions and a research 'speed-dating' session was held. . Twenty-one people participated in total, including members of the African diaspora, volunteers from Heritage Lottery fund projects, university academics, and a HLF representative. The event succeeded in bringing different groups and individuals together, some of whom had previously collaborated, others who had not, and was experimental in this respect. This included making links between those with project ideas and potential funders. A proposal was taken to the Institute of Commonwealth Studies for a Nottingham workshop as part of their series 'What's Happening in Black British History?' but the organisers were not able to commit to this as part of their programme at that time. Notes from the meeting were circulated to participants. Subsequent developments have been the emergence of the Nottingham Black History Society (2016) which is supported by some of those attending this workshop and the securing of funding for a BAME Community History and Heritage Representation day event (7 June 2016) hosted by University of Nottingham and the New Art Exchange Nottingham.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1557cb18626.82922769</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Cotton Connections Peak District field visit 2 (5 July 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FAF3F097-0CF2-4342-AA0A-5113C8BF7889</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participants from Sheffield and Nottingham shared their experiences of Masson and Cromford Mills, particularly in relation to the global cotton story but also with respect to local mill workers and textiles produced.
Sheffield participants combined their further examination of the site with a poetry activity. They made some detailed critique of current information about India. 
Nottingham participants had the opportunity to ask further questions of the Arkwright Society Education Officer as part of their further examination of the site. Disappointment at the coverage of slavery issues was again expressed.
Both groups reflected in their discussion sessions on how the proposed DVMWHS Gateway Visitor Centre at Cromford might cover Indian (Sheffield group) and slavery (Nottingham group) cotton connections. The Nottingham group reflected specifically on portraits of black people proposed by the Visitor Centre consultants and on alternative portraits and images put together by the GCC team. The discussion was very rich and the group was pleased to be asked to put forward views. However, little support was shown for the portraits proposed for use in the Visitor Centre. None of the alternative portraits or cotton plantation images presented were found to be suitable either. Disquiet was expressed at the manner in which the Visitor Centre consultants had engaged only late in the day with the GCC and diverse heritage groups and the short time-scale of this informal consultation. It was felt that consultation with diverse heritage groups and historical experts on global aspects of cotton should have been integrated into the Visitor Centre development plans from the beginning. This omission was thought to be particularly surprising as the visitor centre has HLF backing. Unfortunately this experience of late, informal consultation served to reinforce the idea that diverse heritage groups and their perspectives are under-recognised in cotton heritage sites.

The Sheffield group's critique of the representation of the cotton story in relation to India was fed back to the DVMWHS, the Arkwright Society and the consultants working on the proposed DVMWHS Gateway Visitor Centre.
The Nottingham group's critique, informed by an additional discussion session organised by Bright Ideas, was fed back to the DVMWHS, the Arkwright Society and the consultants working on the proposed DVMWHS Gateway Visitor Centre.

Participants discussed the coverage of global perspectives on the cotton story at Cromford Mill. Concern was expressed at the lack of information on raw cotton supplies and the places, people and production systems which generated them. Members of the Slave Trade Legacies group were particularly upset at the lack of reference to slave-produced cotton, the enslaved Africans who produced it and the wider system of Transatlantic slavery, including the Slave Trade, which facilitated this. Members of the Hindu Samaj discussed ways in which British colonial policy in relation to Indian textiles impacted on the Indian cotton industry and helped stimulate cotton textile production in the Derwent Valley. 
Participants were relieved to find more information on the global cotton story at Belper North Mill Museum, including the sourcing of raw cotton from the Americas and India and a connection acknowledged between Belper cotton thread and textile production and the slave trade. Lively discussions were held with the guides leading the three tour groups though coverage of slavery issues was felt to be variable. Participants discussed whether guides felt uncomfortable talking about the slave trade and colonial issues.
Participants collected materials (photos, film, textiles) to help inform heritage legacy outputs.

After this visit both groups were determined in their desire to see changes to the presentation of the cotton story at cotton mill heritage venues. Feedback on the visits, highlighting frustration at the lack of coverage of global perspectives on cotton, was sent by the GCC to the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site, the Arkwright Society and Belper North Mill Museum.

These were held on Saturday 20th June 2015 at Cromford Mills under the title 'Global Cotton Connections: Creative Encounters'. The purpose was to share a range of GCC-related outputs, particularly those produced by the associated community groups, with general public visitors to Cromford Mills and wider diverse communities bussed in from Nottingham and Sheffield. Activities involved three sessions (10am, 12noon and 2pm) of the 'Global Cotton Connections: Untangling the Threads of Slavery' film show and 'British Raj in the Peak District: Threads of Connection' poetry readings hosted by the Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies group and Sheffield Hindu Samaj cultural group held in the Exhibition room at Cromford Mills. This room also displayed wider materials produced as part of the Global Cotton Connections project, including a poster created by the Sheffield Hindu Samaj group also drawing on their HLF project work, and work on textiles from the AHRC Legacies of Rural Slavery and Colonialism scoping project. These events were attended by about 25 members of the wider public (including some volunteer mill guides) and around 55 people of mainly African Caribbean or Indian heritage background associated with the wider Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies group, facilitated by Bright Ideas Nottingham, and the Sheffield Hindu Samaj cultural group, brought to the site by coach. These participants also had the opportunity to take guided tours at Cromford and Belper. They were asked to identify the main things they gained from the day. Most (27 out of 44, 10 from Nottingham, 17 from Sheffield) referred to gaining new knowledge of the cotton mills or cotton industry more broadly, with reference to cotton connections (6 mentions) particularly between the mills and India (4 mentions), cotton origins (2 mentions) and the role of the slave trade (2 mentions). A number of participants (7), mostly from the Nottingham group, highlighted gains from sharing, solidarity and meeting like-minded people. A small number (3) referred to the rewards of seeing the impact of their research projects in the mill venues. Comments from the general public were positive and included 'great to hear the 'hidden' histories'; 'inspiring'; 'excellent experience'; 'wanted more!'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0468f404881.49997701</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://globalcottonconnections.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>11871</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

A particular case study was made of the Strutt cotton mills in the later 18th and early 19th centuries. Most of their raw cotton came from the Americas and was produced via slave-based systems. A publication on this element of the archival research is now available. An emerging case study is on the Dinting Vale print works in the late 19th and early 20th century. This company had globally differentiated markets for its printed cotton fabrics. The Peak District visits highlighted a lack of information about global cotton connections in heritage venues. The community groups have reflected on archival information and the sites and given feedback to the venues visited. The Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site and the Arkwright Society have been given feedback on archival work undertaken in relation to the Derwent Valley Mills, and community group and academic reactions to the sites, tour guide presentations and proposals for a new Gateway Visitor Centre. This new Visitor Centre is now open to the public and is informed by, and contains reference to, the GCC project's archival research, most notably in relation to raw cotton supplies. The design of the panels also reflects feedback from the project and its associated community groups, the Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies Group and the Sheffield Hindu Samaj Heritage group. This important development has therefore made this new heritage facility more globally contextualised and more tailored to a range of ethnically diverse audiences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings related to the archival research in the Derwent Valley have been issued in a book sponsored by The Arkwright Society. This chapter is freely available via the GCC project website and at Cromford Mills which is owned by the Arkwright Society. This means the material is available to inform educational materials and mill tour guides in the Derwent Valley. Key findings from the archival research and diverse ethnic perspectives on cotton which emerged from the GCC's liaison with African-Caribbean and Indian heritage groups are also embedded in the new Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site Gateway Visitor Centre at Cromford Mills. This has been open to the public since 1 Feb 2016 and had its official opening on 10 March 2016. The project findings have been presented to community and academic audiences in Nottingham and London. The contributions by members of the GCC to the DVMWHS Research Framework will also contribute to the development of future research in the area. There are plans to produce a co-written account of the research from the viewpoints of academic and community participants for publication and in light of the on-going collaboration through the Practising Reparative Histories grant.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4C09AC3A-F41D-4702-8574-6B1836F1D9AB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463a8057e44a0.05117625</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.globalcottonconnections.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultation over Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site Research Framework, 2 April 2014 (Cromford) and 15 May 2014 (Belper)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C78B699-4CB5-4B61-B5BF-044881B5AC35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462259481d623.33208809</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultation over Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site Gateway Exhibition Visitor Centre, Cromford</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9205810B-0DF6-4242-9AEE-47C3F1842821</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Feedback from the Global Cotton Connections project and its associated community groups (Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies group and Sheffield Hindu Samaj Heritage group) is reflected in the recently opened Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site Gateway Visitor Centre at Cromford Mills (1 Feb 2016). This presents a new vision of the Valley's cotton industry connections with colonial developments in India and the Americas, including the Atlantic system of slavery and the displays include new information on global sources of raw cotton provided by the GCC project. Explicit reference to the contributions made by enslaved African people and Indian workers to the founding of the Derwent Valley cotton industry is made in the Centre's new co-designed landscape visualisation which was commented on by the community groups and the academic members of the GCC. 

In relation to this work and associated work, the Director of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site made the following comment:
&amp;quot;Historical interpretation usually has some element of bias, and even if not intentional, can also mislead through omission. The Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site was keen to ensure that the role of the transatlantic slave trade and its legacy was reflected in the story of these world-changing mills. The invitation to work with the Global Cotton Connections Project was timely. The group worked with the Belper North Mill Trust and the Arkwright Society at Cromford Mills. The group offered new ideas and a challenge to the interpreters at both sites. At Cromford their input fed directly into the design of the new Gateway Centre for the World Heritage Site which opened in 2016. The group acted as a critical friend to the section of the gallery which focussed on the origin of the raw cotton. Their work on the source of the cotton for Strutt's Belper mills also informed this gallery and expanded the vocabulary of the guides at the Belper Mill.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462102037b301.76933868</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input into Arkwright Society's Cromford Mills guides (on-going)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BD8ED7C-B942-4B5F-A2FC-2C32440858BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Involvement with the GCC project has assisted the volunteer guides at Cromford Mills in Derbyshire in developing a more global story of cotton to present to visitors. For example, the volunteer manager at Cromford Mills made the following statement:
'We always welcome new or additional research into any aspect of cotton spinning and the textile industry which helps us to expand or reconfirm the stories we tell our visitors. The information on Global Cotton Connections in the Gateway has taken the story out of the Derwent Valley and given a global context to everything that happened here and the impact it had on lives around the world.'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621135ac57b9.34696787</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CD3D53C6-F0DC-4F27-B6CC-3B46F8CB120E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site Research Framework</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/377c2dd55bc39e47581e56b592079fe1"><gtr:id>377c2dd55bc39e47581e56b592079fe1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Seymour S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-9541940-7-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56e05126bd08d4.17576508</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>57894D78-801F-4531-9A4B-3C8ED0F1E50F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Industrial Revolution: Cromford, The Derwent Valley and The Wider World</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/377c2dd55bc39e47581e56b592079fe1"><gtr:id>377c2dd55bc39e47581e56b592079fe1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Seymour S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-903149-07-5</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56dec07bd2b6a9.56312359</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17878821-0609-44E8-8A4D-1538C75EA767</gtr:id><gtr:title>Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site Research Framework</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/377c2dd55bc39e47581e56b592079fe1"><gtr:id>377c2dd55bc39e47581e56b592079fe1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Seymour S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-9541940-7-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56e05277312189.11855909</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L013312/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D6754CC-B7DE-45FB-BB9D-CE7AA05892D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Historical Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>15FF42B9-E8E0-4428-BAF1-5EBBA88C2D38</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
