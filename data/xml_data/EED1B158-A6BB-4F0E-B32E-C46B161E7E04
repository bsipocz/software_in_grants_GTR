War</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008297/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Gateways consists of Kent, Brighton, Greenwich and Portsmouth HEIs together with an extensive range of collaborators and will provide a gateway for wide public access to: 1) a network of research excellence in First World War Studies 2) skills and resources to develop a range of outputs 3) the geographical gateway to the Western Front and wider war. 

Through Gateways the British public will be given the opportunity to engage with, understand and interpret a historical event that played a fundamental role in the shaping of the contemporary world and their place within it. In exploring the local, wherever located, they will engage with the global. They will also engage with their own preconceptions and be encouraged to test and question their origins. Gateways will then use this as a base to examine the (dis)connection between academic/official history and popular perceptions. Gateways will use the combination of its recognised research strengths and high profile in First World War Studies, practitioner skills, resources and geography to explore themes universal to the experience of the First World War:
 
The global nature of the conflict.
The importance of the sea and overseas communications.
The blurred line between fighting and home fronts; how people understood the nature of the conflict and the acts of combat.
The effect of transplanting communities and creating new ones.
Moments of culture clash and moments of culture harmony.
How different memories and legacies emerged from the conflict, why some endured, mutated or were marginalised. 


Gateways has three elements: 
1) Core members: building on the existing research interests and public engagement links centred on the First World War anniversaries between Brighton, Greenwich, Kent and Portsmouth HEIs. For example, Kent and Portsmouth are developing a research network exploring the experience of Imperial port cities during the conflict in association with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies; Greenwich and Kent are working on a programme for schools and colleges; Brighton and Portsmouth have collaborated on a photographic project with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
2) Project collaborators: extending and exploiting existing partnerships with non-HEI bodies for the benefit of the wider community. Examples include: Chatham Dockyard Museum, Cognitive Media, Hampshire County Council, Kent County Council, Maidstone Museum, Marlowe Theatre (Canterbury), National Maritime Museum, Portsmouth City Museums, Royal Engineers Museum, Library and Archive (hereafter REMLA), Screen South, War Memorials Trust.
3) Network members: drawing in other academics from a wide range of disciplines with expertise relevant to the objectives of Gateways. For a list of key network members see pp6-7.

Gateways is geographically based in a region that has a unique historical status:
SE England was the Gateway to the Western Front and was the hinge on which the British war effort hung. Its ports of Southampton, Newhaven, Folkestone, Dover and the naval bases of Chatham and Portsmouth were the nodal points.
The region was a militarised zone covered with defence lines and fortifications including the British army's main base at Aldershot. It was a liminal space between fighting and home fronts; a cultural and racial melting pot containing imperial contingents (Africans, Canadians, Indians and West Indians), Chinese Labour Corps camps and large numbers of Belgian refugees.
The region became the home of vast hospital encampments which further ensured that the presence of the war and its effects remained constant.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Gateways to the First World War will make a considerable impact based on its core overarching aims: 

That the British public is given the opportunity to engage with, understand and interpret a historical event that played a fundamental role in the shaping of the contemporary world and their place within it. In exploring the local, wherever located, they will engage with the global. They will also engage with their own preconceptions and be encouraged to test and question their origins. Gateways will then use this as a base to examine the (dis)connection between academic/official history and popular perceptions. 
 
It will use a broad range of platforms and partnerships to ensure that its events and resources are disseminated and achieve a high profile including a purpose-built website, use of social media, programmes with schools, colleges, museums, archive centres, galleries and international collaborators.

Local communities and the wider public in general
As noted above, connection with communities is the key to Gateways' plan. It will provide a wide-range of people with the skills and confidence to engage with academic research according to their own interests, develop new partnership and community links and inspire a lasting legacy. 

The Third Sector
Gateways will enhance relationships with existing partners still further and pioneer new links. It will demonstrate fully that both HEIs and the third sector can interact fruitfully to mutual benefit which then also enhances the lives of the wider public. Examples of existing partnerships include:
Museums, galleries and archives: Brighton Pavilion and Museums, Chatham Dockyard Museum, Cognitive Media, Kent County Council Archives, Libraries and Museums, Maidstone Museum, National Maritime Museum, Portsmouth City Museums, Royal Engineers Museum, Library, Screen South. Of great interest is the ability to interact with the Flanders Field Museum, Ieper/Ypres due to the research overlaps enhanced by geographical proximity which will mean an Impact beyond the UK.
Key First World War-interest groups and organisations: War Memorials Trust, Western Front Association.
The initial mechanism for harnessing the links will be the series of public engagement open days and follow-up events planned by Gateways. These will pave the way for further collaborative involvement in Connected Communities and Translating Cultures research applications particularly designed to investigate reactions to the centenary events and ensure comparative studies beyond the UK 

The media

Gateways members are already engaging with the media on the First World War centenary at a local, national and international level. Three network members took part in the AHRC-BBC national seminar and two have been selected in the recent AHRC-BBC scheme. The centre's commitment to a comprehensive public engagement process which brings together and effectively harnesses cutting edge research with community interest will ensure a high and regular profile for the centre in the media. Further, the research interests of Gateways very much overlap with areas of media engagement. The communications offices of all Gateways institutions are aware of the significance of the anniversary and are committed to ensuring that the research expertise of its members is highlighted.

Policy-makers, governments and public sector agencies
Gateways will provide a flagship case study for the UK government and public sector agencies on large-scale academic-community involvement which can be drawn upon to inform approaches to similar high-profile events such as the forthcoming Second World War (75th) anniversary cycle. Gateways' experiences will be of value to: the Departments of Education; Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage (and its pan-UK equivalents). Gateways will establish points of contact with these agencies and provide six-monthly reports on its experiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>597162</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This exhibition explores the history of the British community in Ypres after the First World War.

The Gateways team has worked with a number of groups developing applications to the Heritage Lottery Fund, offering academic guidance and advice on project development. The work carried out has culminated in eleven successful applications to the HLF during 2015, with twenty applications currently in development. The centre has also provided support for projects which have already been awarded funding from HLF by providing academic talks, training, advice, volunteer recruitment, and support for events and publicity.

In addition to the centre's work with project groups and regional offices, the team has supported the central HLF team in their attempts to generate interest in the First World War Then &amp;amp; Now Scheme. Zo&amp;euml; Denness took a lead in developing the joint engagement centres website http://ww1engage.org.uk/ (liaising with Prof. Sarah Lloyd of Everyday Lives and Anna Jarvis of HLF) to make it a more suitable platform for introducing HLF groups to support available from the centres. The site was therefore able to be launched in June 2015.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>In Flanders Fields Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>In Flanders Fields Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>19611884-09D4-4B51-954E-F27EF633FD25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk at In Flanders Fields Museum, Ypres (Helen Brooks)

The results of the project will be initially disseminated through a series of public talks at the University of Chichester during the spring and summer of 2016 to mark the hundredth anniversary of the beginning of the Battle of the Somme and the arrival of wounded soldiers from this battlefield to Graylingwell Hospital. 

Progress in meeting objectives to date:

- Heritage Trail - Due for completion in June 2016: research has been conducted and the material for the trail has been developed.
- Online Resource - Due to go live in July 2016: the volunteers are beginning to produce their reports which will form the basis of the project.
- Exhibition - Due to be used in the Novium Museum, the Cathedral and the university from July to October 2016.

The project has also developed new links with local organisations to build further outcomes:

Those planned are:

Academic Outcomes
- Journal article targeted at the Journal of Transport History. The subject matter will reflect the results of the archival investigation and reflect how WW1 shaped the workplace and the production of engineering products within Thornycroft.
- This project offers the opportunity to develop a case study that explores the impact of WW1 on Thornycroft as a business. 
- The opportunity to work with museums and archives enhancing the engagement skills of the academic partner through having to present work within a different context, namely a museum/archive display. 

Community Partner Outcomes 
- Increased awareness and understanding of the Thornycroft collections amongst staff, volunteers, researchers, special interest groups, visitors to the museums, online visitors and event participants
- Increase in visits to the Thornycroft Gallery at Milestones and events stimulated by project
- Increase in volunteer numbers and volunteer hours directed towards Thornycroft collections
- Increase in use of online resources relating to Thornycroft and Hampshire's industrial history
- Increase in visits to the archives in Winchester and Southampton
- Increased engagement with the local University and appreciation of the wider academic debates that will be informed by the collections.


Wider Community Outcomes
- Greater knowledge and skills in research and collections management developed amongst collections volunteers through the workshop and regular meetings.
- Greater knowledge and interest in Thornycroft and Hampshire's industrial history amongst general public and special interest groups
- Increase in engagement between museums and archives and family historians, local clubs and societies
- Educational audiences through University outreach activity and input into Business History education within the University through lectures to educational establishments.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a9c1d26862.08692632-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This project seeks to develop public understanding of and engagement with Hampshire's industrial history using archives from the Thornycroft collection in the care of Hampshire Cultural Trust and Archives held by Southampton City Council Arts and Heritage, both of whom are Community Partners in this project. 

It will inform the themes of life on the home front as experienced by the workforce and managers of John Thornycroft Ltd. As the company was engaged in the production of vehicles and ships, this will also contribute to our understanding of how war production was organised. 

This research will be used as a basis for enhancing the contextualisation and interpretation of the Thornycroft Collections held by the two community partners. Members of the public will benefit from improved interpretation in the gallery devoted to Thornycroft and in the street scenes at Milestone Museum in Basingstoke. There will also be new online resources, talks and a workshop. Volunteers will have the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and skills whilst supporting the cataloguing and management of the archive collection held by both partners. Volunteers with accounting, legal and/or business skills will be made aware of how their expertise can inform historical analysis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a research project led by Dr Roy Edwards (University of Southampton) in collaboration with Hampshire Cultural Trust and Southampton City Council, Arts and Heritage.

First, it feeds into Alison Fell's and Christine Hallett's (both network members) ongoing research into WW1 nursing memoirs; second, it will turn Sister Edie Appleton's published diaries 'Nurse At The Front' into a well-researched and innovative theatrical production.

The project has so far:

1. Held a successful event in the National Archives (Dec 2015), Kew, involving a diverse audience and involving Alison Fell, Christine Hallett as speakers, as well as an archivist from the Royal College of Nursing, and a reading of Edie's diaries. Other events involving students are in preparation and will take place later in 2016.
2. Christine Hallett and Alison Fell have so far attended 4 meetings with the creative team, introducing archival materials, answering questions about historical context of the diaries, and finally commenting on drafts of the script. The draft script is now complete. 
3. We have sourced relevant WW1 nursing materials, including annotated reading lists, introductions to relevant databases and archival holdings, and other nurses' diaries. These will feed into the HLF bid in preparation, and will form the basis of the educational package. 
4. Alison Fell gave the academic paper in September 2015, and it has since been published online.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a research project led by Professor Alison Fell (University of Leeds) in collaboration with Sara Robinson (independent producer), Morgan Malcolm (writer), Dani Parr (director), Kate Bunce (designer), The Unthanks (folk group), The Exchange Theatre, Manchester and the National Archives, Kew.

Planned outcomes and outputs are:

1. Study weekend for the general public. See project plan. 

2. In cooperation with local partners production of information materials for the general public: a website, an app for iPhone/Android based on the 3D modelling currently produced by the RCAHMS, and printed information materials. Concrete input from academics' expertise will, for example, include maps and pictures of camps in Britain and the Empire, and repository information on sources which are not held locally. In this, Manz has already advised Historic Scotland and the Royal Commission. The website will be more comprehensive and interpretive than the only one which exists at the moment (http://stobs-camp.bizhat.com/). The electronic materials will be developed with input from media students at Hawick High School. They will constitute accessible teaching resources to teach First World War history in local schools. 

3. Extended press engagement through PR-agency 

4. Academic outputs by Manz, all informed by interaction with the general public and with due acknowledgement: 
- comparative article on Stobs and Knockaloe for Immigrants and Minorities. Special issue on internment, edited by Panikos Panayi and Zoe Denness; proposal to be submitted by July 2015; write-up during grant period
- article for Scottish Historical Review on Stobs within the context of imperial internment structures
-two papers and one workshop at Brigham Young University and Utah State University
-chapter on colonial residents deported to Stobs in co-authored monograph, with Panikos Panayi: Interning 'enemy aliens' in the British Empire during the First World War. First positive reactions on draft proposal from Cambridge University Press series editors (Publications of the German Historical Institute Washington). Publication of this output will be after the end of the project period. 

6.

 We presented our project findings to date as a basis for a roundtable discussion on how this material might best be used in an Adult Education setting (i.e. to aid planning of the two public workshops). We also gained advice from local historians on other sources of information and relevant local archives. 
This succeeded as a networking event - providing contacts for recruiting to our public workshops. It was also an opportunity for academic project partners and other attendees to learn more about the internal dynamics and organisation of the WEA, and some of its current policy concerns (and to think more closely about how research into its activities in the First World War can help in how it re-assesses and communicates its current purpose).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c285858c0cb7.92354301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk for local history society, Lewes, November 2014 (Lucy Noakes)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F8DB65D3-0191-40EB-BE91-9FC02DD1CB2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was a long discussion after the talk, mainly focusing on the home front and the Sussex region.

They produced short sketches after engaging with the material which was filmed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6f4be6b8381.43438289</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://watheatre.co/sheffield-families-in-ww1.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop at Leeds University with the Preservative Party (young people's group working with Leeds Museums), Feb 2016 (Alison Fell)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F6BB78C3-618F-4C50-8432-1BCDAD8BD0FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a short talk on WW1 nursing and research methods to the young people who are curating an exhibition on life in Leeds in WW1 that will take place in Leeds City Museum and be launched on 1 July 2016.

Students were taught how to research individuals from the First World War and they then examined a series of databases to find out information on former pupils of their school. The objective of the session was to enable students to build a history of their school in the war, which we will work with them to put on the project website, to develop a report on their work and to design a small exhibition.

Following the session, the school's teacher declared their commitment to the project and the team will work with the school to develop a programme of engagement and a dissemination event with the school regarding the history of former pupils in the war. An activity which they would not have been able to do otherwise.

The teacher reported to us:

The event included stalls and / or presentations from 11 community groups and heritage organisations. 

There was a range of round table discussions between all attendees, which included speakers centre staff and FWW HLF applicants at enquiry, development and award stages. The questions discussed were:

- What are the main challenges when developing an HLF project application and what solutions can you suggest?
- What networks are available that will be of assistance to developing projects?
- What local FWW histories are under-researched, hidden or silenced?
- How can we ensure that FWW projects appeal to a broad range of participants and audiences?
- What can the engagement centres do to add value to your project?
- What barriers do community projects encounter in practice and how can these be overcome? 

The event also included a digitisation workshop from the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis. A report on this aspect can be found here: http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforDataDigitisationandAnalysis/News/#d.en.525612 

10 out of the 13 attendees who provided feedback reported that the networking opportunities were the most valuable aspect of the event. This has been taken on board by the engagement centres when planning future events.

The event enabled relationships to be strengthened between the individual engagement centres and with partners such as the FWW Centenary Partnership, HLF and Historypin.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d96634009cc6.80402843</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ww1engage.org.uk/633/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Gateways to German &amp; Austrian Experiences study day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>549E2E7D-D618-4F13-A6F5-99AE6B86A8FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event introduced members of the public to academic research on lesser known aspects of the First World War. They were invited to interact with academics and ask questions. Advice was given on research.

During the event, discussions began with Yvonne Cresswell (Manx National Heritage) regarding the development of an HLF bid, bringing together projects across the country working on internment. This was, in part inspired by the inclusion in the event of a talk from the HLF-funded community 'Little Germany' project by Eastside Community Heritage.

Discussions also took place with Dr Matthew Stibbe about developing a community-focused event in conjunction with Sheffield Hallam University for 2016.

On 31 March we received an email from an attendee at the event who was preparing a talk on women in the First World War for local groups and history societies. The event had inspired her to think beyond British experiences and we advised her on sources for further research.

The event included stalls and / or presentations from 11 community groups and heritage organisations. 

There was a range of round table discussions between all attendees, which included speakers centre staff and FWW HLF applicants at enquiry, development and award stages. The questions discussed were:

- What are the main challenges when developing an HLF project application and what solutions can you suggest?
- What networks are available that will be of assistance to developing projects?
- What local FWW histories are under-researched, hidden or silenced?
- How can we ensure that FWW projects appeal to a broad range of participants and audiences?
- What can the engagement centres do to add value to your project?
- What barriers do community projects encounter in practice and how can these be overcome? 

The event also included a digitisation workshop from the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis. A report on this aspect can be found here: http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforDataDigitisationandAnalysis/News/#d.en.525612

17 out of the 31 attendees who provided feedback reported that the networking opportunities were the most valuable aspect of the event. This has been taken on board by the engagement centres when planning future events.

The event enabled relationships to be strengthened between the individual engagement centres and with partners such as the FWW Centenary Partnership, HLF and Historypin.

1. HLF: I advised a range of local stakeholders, led by Archaeology Scotland, on two HLF-applications. Both have been successful and are concerned with archaeological groundwork, digitalisation, and community activities. My input was primarily to give a broader picture of internment and confirm the global significance of the site.

These workshops were designed as to engage the public in the topics of Adult Education and the Great War, which by the time of the Leeds workshop had evolved into a focus on the WEA and the campaign to abolish Child Labour in the Great War. The result was a two-way interaction between the project team and local historians and researchers, and WEA members. 
The impact was broadly educational - with adult learners reporting in surveys after the workshops that their knowledge of this topic had been significantly enhanced and that they had welcomed the engagement with the archival material - some were used to working with archival documents, for others this was a new experience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c286e32ec252.97745299</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>First World War Seminar Series 2015-16: Professor Keith Lilley</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C5D3858A-23D5-4055-B9CD-84462F00562B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk in Ypres from Dr Keith D.

1) Community Day for a local volunteer group
2) A film event at the local cinema
3) Schools events

The event included stalls and / or presentations from 7 community groups and heritage organisations. 

There was a range of round table discussions between all attendees, which included speakers centre staff and FWW HLF applicants at enquiry, development and award stages. The questions discussed were:

- What are the main challenges when developing an HLF project application and what solutions can you suggest?
- What networks are available that will be of assistance to developing projects?
- What local FWW histories are under-researched, hidden or silenced?
- How can we ensure that FWW projects appeal to a broad range of participants and audiences?
- What can the engagement centres do to add value to your project?
- What barriers do community projects encounter in practice and how can these be overcome? 

The event also included a digitisation workshop from the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis. A report on this aspect can be found here: http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforDataDigitisationandAnalysis/News/#d.en.525612 

17 out of the 31 attendees who provided feedback reported that the networking opportunities were the most valuable aspect of the event. This has been taken on board by the engagement centres when planning future events.

The event enabled relationships to be strengthened between the individual engagement centres and with partners such as the FWW Centenary Partnership, HLF and Historypin.

A conversation with a community group leader developing a project on the experiences of enemy aliens during the First World War has led to plans for a collaborative event organised by Gateways to the First World War and the Hidden Histories engagement centre for an event in 2016 bringing together similar projects to showcase their research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9672603e063.50030883</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ww1engage.org.uk/633/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visit, Simon Langton, December 2015 (Emma Hanna)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3CD37277-9F2C-42FE-8565-61425D53CEBA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a 55 minute presentation on the history and legacy of the Christmas Truce (1914) and the pupils asked a range of questions about this event and the ways in which it has been researched and represented in the media.

Round table discussions looked at how to best shape their projects.
The audience were better informed about support for FWW heritage projects.

There was a wide ranging interaction between the academics and the students: the participants expressed different research interests and were encouraged to follow these up when possible. Interests included: British press perception of refugees, the use of Francophone advertisements in London-based newspapers and the experiences of refugee children. 
NewVIc students also took the opportunity to ask Charlotte Faucher about studying at university, university teaching and application process as they knew she was lecturing at Queen Mary.
The visits led to an exhibition (reported separately).
The participants have gained better insights into the making and practice of history. They used archive materials and understand the challenges of research. Much of our discussion focused on Belgian (and to a lesser extent French) refugees in Britain and this had two consequences: 
? To challenge the frequent historical domination of the French population over the Belgian people
? To add to the historical knowledge of the participants as few of them were aware of the refugee crisis which struck Britain during the First World War.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b018cfa075c3.66736012</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ww1francophonesinlondon.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WhitLit Festival, Whitstable, May 2015 (Helen Brooks)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>085644A6-E0C7-4CEC-B307-9B9D5A06D88D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was stimulating and lively discussion amongst the audience and presenters about the specific play being presented and about how FWW drama should be better understood as part of the war experience.

They were able to utilise much material that has not been publicly displayed for many years, thus leaving the local heritage record better interpreted and explained.

Many members of the audience are considering developing submissions to the HLF for First World War related projects, so there was enthusiastic engagement and interest, with wide ranging questions.

The event was aimed at community and other groups with an interest in First World War history, or who were already working on a project investigating the history of their community in the First World War. The aim was both to introduce them to Gateways, to stimulate their research ideas via presentations by historians, by the HLF and by representatives of groups who have been awarded HLF funding for First World War projects, and thus to encourage them to work with Gateways to develop projects and apply to the HLF. 

Promising discussions developed in particular regarding bids to the HLF from community researchers based in Eastleigh and Bramber/Beeding. These will be followed up by the Co I and Community Historian, both of whom were present.

HLF were very pleased with our contribution and were keen for a repeat. Dr Sam Carroll followed up the event with emails to all the attendees and had responses from the following:

Western Kurdistan Association
Project development advice and letter of support. Gateways have offered ongoing guidance and have secured support from Dr Djene Bajalan, who is based at The American University of Iraq in Sulaimani and an expert in this field of interest. Dr Bajalan has agreed to provide the project with research and historical advice when required.

Independent researcher
He had some wonderful FWW photos and memorabilia, but as an independent researcher he didn't have any means to apply to HLF. Sam advised him to contact Surrey Remembers and offer his resources to them.

Step Short
Sam met with a project representative and discussed the project in development which centres on collecting stories and creating a tapestry about the FWW in Folkestone. He will be back in touch when he has tightened the project application.

Tower Hamlets Library
Email exchange re planned HLF application for a project focusing on childhood and air raids, specifically 1917 and Upper North Street School in the Borough

Third Sector Media
Harwich project- ongoing research advice and project consultations. They are putting a large HLF bid together.

There was some useful discussion from the audience on the paper. Questions raised ranged from how the research was conducted to the findings themselves. A number of the audience were sufficiently engaged and stimulated with the paper to ask if they could have access to the database to conduct their own research.

An audience survey was conducted and the following statements recorded:
Riveting!
The range and diversity of the material presented. A well-constructed agenda with good presenters.
They have been revelatory.
Not so much changed but widened and deepened my understanding.
Very pleased to see the focus on the impact of Jutland rather than the details of the battle itself.
They have confirmed that you need to investigate more than the popular stories to fully understand a situation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c280f75f9406.96113361</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to the London branch of the Queen's Own Buffs Association, Union Jack Club, 'The Buffs and the Christmas Truce' (Mark Connelly) Nov 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4D8A3CE-E055-477E-A2A8-67A03F767062</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose was to share information and stimulate thinking.

A series of research days at the British Library with 2 participants each time. Participants were trained in accessing and using the BL manuscripts collection of FWW plays. They spent the day researching and recording information on plays produced during FWW. Extensive discussion of theatrical production during FWW, the impact of censorship, and the type of theatre being produced. Participants gained skills in using digital research tools and undertaking primary research in archives. 
Following the research days 17 participants requested to undertake further research in their own time. Many participants also contributed valuable skills and knowledge, and suggested avenues for development. This led to the development of a community group on the subject and the application to the Community group funding. From this project and the learning gained there are now 60 confirmed participants (to date) for the second phase of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1714a4af274.67354319</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Study Day Folkestone School (Mark Connelly) July 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>683C6E56-26A1-4D13-9EC1-4C21CD626C5B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose was to share information and stimulate thinking, and to improve understanding of other's thinking.

Dr Carroll organised and chaired this event which was hosted by Gateways as support for Zap arts and Insite Theatre's FWW project on Conscientious Objection. Dr Carroll introduced Gateways and explained the support we offer, before introducing each speaker in turn. We recruited three speakers for this seminar. Jenny Flood (Project Officer, Newhaven's War, HLF funded project), Dr Chris Kempshall (Project Officer for East Sussex County Council's First World War Centenary Project) and The Revd. Dr Clive Barrett (Author of Subversive Peacemakers - War Resistance 1914-1918: An Anglican Perspective, chair of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship and the Peace Museum in Bradford). Dr Carroll chaired a Q and A afterwards which was a lively discussion about Conscientious Objection in the FWW and also about FWW project development. The seminar was followed by a performance of Sara Clifford's play &amp;quot;The Tribunal&amp;quot;.
Following this event Dr Carroll had two discussions with community partners who were interested in developing FWW projects with the aim of applying for HLF funding. These potential projects are still in the early stages of development and Dr Carroll is still in contact with them.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58af0d0350b058.77572970</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.marlboroughtheatre.org.uk/event/the-tribunal-pre-show-seminar-on-first-world-war-conscientious-objection/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press Release: Adult Education in the Great War (Rebecca Gill)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2F4BF1E-F4B6-4B1F-B781-90B526649FFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose to share information.

Outputs have included films, performances, exhibitions, apps, archival and online resource training, events and community workshops. Details of these outputs can be found in the Engagement Activities &amp;amp; Artistic &amp;amp; Creative Products sections.

The Gateways team has worked with a number of groups developing applications to the Heritage Lottery Fund, offering academic guidance and advice on project development. The work carried out has culminated in sixteen successful applications to the HLF, with twenty further applications currently in development. The centre has also provided support for projects which have already been awarded funding from HLF by providing academic talks, training, advice, volunteer recruitment, and support for events and publicity.

The centre has run a programme of high-quality events, organised in a variety of locations. These have involved: sharing the latest academic research on the First World War to enrich and inspire existing and developing projects; workshops and training; showcasing of HLF projects; networking opportunities. Further details of events have been submitted in the Engagement Activities section.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DCC88F08-345E-4509-8044-C4FC80A0300C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7dbff3e5d7.57315541</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have moved into Phase 2 of the award. The interim reports can be found via the AHRC and the application for Phase 2 also includes the summary of how the future programme (2017-19) has built on the experiences of Phase 1.

Below are some extracts from that application which summarise the position:

Since its launch in 2014 Gateways to the First World War has encouraged community groups and members of the public to broaden their research by asking new questions, connecting with diverse communities and creating imaginative outputs (see interim report for details). The aim outlined in the original funding application, of encouraging people to 'engage with their own preconceptions andtest and question their origins', has remained central to the ethos of the centre. The centre is, and will remain, firmly rooted in its internationally-recognised research into the history of the conflict and its legacy. Gateways will continue to offer this resource to all centres and, specifically, will offer leadership in particular themes (see 2 below).
The centre has developed a programme of high-quality events, organised in a variety of locations, which have involved sharing the latest academic research on the First World War to enrich and inspire existing and developing projects, workshops and training, showcasing of HLF projects and networking opportunities. As planned in the original application for funding, collaborations with non-HEI bodies has been a key element of the Gateways project and the centre has established and extended strong partnerships with a range of organisations including the Imperial War Museum, First World War Centenary Partnership, Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Significant activities are underway to support these organisations, particularly for the Somme 100 commemorations, and will continue over the next two years. The centre has established UK-wide reach through its travelling exhibitions, events (including a successful community Roadshow) and academic and community collaborations in a number of regions, including Scotland.

Gateways will continue its highly successful programme of themed study days focused on its core research themes and its relationship with key archival centres. The general outline of such events has been to bring together expert researchers on the particular historical theme, relevant archivists and record keepers and, if possible, groups studying that particular theme to present their findings. So far we have staged 11 such events and they have proved extremely positive especially with community groups and organisations many of which have received HLF funding. Many of these events have been delivered with significant partners such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the National Archives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are working with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Royal British Legion and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on various plans for wider community engagement with the Great War centenary, as well as the Institute of Education's Schools Battlefields Tours programme. We are currently developing a range of collaborative activities including an important contribution to the Third Battle of Ypres centenary in July of this year. This has built on the collaboration effort we made with DCMS to mark Somme 100 last year. We will report more fully on this in next year's summary.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>30B82A04-2FBD-4617-BCD5-B0211DD83B5A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7dd82c66a1.97066820</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gatewaysfww.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D87B7875-814E-41AF-9452-A773C7060E93</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remembering the Great War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d49c9df6846155e64bcb1f81ce2b8286"><gtr:id>d49c9df6846155e64bcb1f81ce2b8286</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Grant P and Hanna, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-85632-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>55cdf7aa7ba9a5.44709021</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3BF014E8-54F9-4033-99F6-BF199C7EAC09</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping the national impact of the Jutland Battle: civic and community responses during the First World War</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Maritime History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15"><gtr:id>0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bassett, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56c1e5aa787dd9.62500996</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>90011E3C-A65F-4CF7-B032-2BDA904E264E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Christmas Truce 1914-1918: Myths and Realities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e"><gtr:id>bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hanna, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>55cdf663246584.24107871</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D0D51791-4410-47A2-AAF9-40C3F3C3046E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping the national impact of the Jutland Battle: civic and community responses during the First World War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15"><gtr:id>0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bassett, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56c1e6298ac5c2.76785126</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B7F3834B-BD2E-4412-939D-A89CAA10E281</gtr:id><gtr:title>A broken silence?
