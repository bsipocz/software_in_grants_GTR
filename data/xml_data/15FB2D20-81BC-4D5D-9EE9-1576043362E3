The style and variability of rift-associated deformation is, however, poorly constrained due to deep burial of stn-rift rocks. The young (&amp;lt; 5 Ma), active Gulf of Corinth rift (Greece) offers a unique opportunity to investigate the sedimentary records of incipient rifting and infer important constraints on this poorly understood process, due to its pristine, more accessible syn-rift sequence. IODP Expedition 381 will recover sediments from the Corinth syn-rift sequence with the aim to resolve at a high temporal and spatial resolution how faults evolve in an incipient rift system and how deformation is re-distributed. These goals will be achieved mainly by producing a high-resolution age model of the syn-rift sequence and correlate it to the know sub-surface rift structure and onshore stratigraphy. While understanding how deformation progressed in this rift system is crucial, reconstructing the nature, orientation, and magnitude of the tectonic stress field associated to rift formation represents an additional, key step to resolve the poorly known cause and mechanism that controlled continental rifting.

In this project we will use anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) analysis, which is one of the most effective techniques for paleo-stress investigations. AMS is a petrofabric tool commonly used to determine the preferred orientation of grains (i.e. fabric) in rocks and reconstruct the style, orientation, and intensity of the paleo-stress field that produced that fabric. AMS analysis of the Corinth syn-rift sequence recovered during IODP Expedition 381 will help in reconstructing for the first time the variation in orientation and intensity of the tectonic stresses that controlled the formation of the Corinth rift system. Furthermore, a more precise dating of those intervals where classical biostratigraphic techniques may fail, will be obtained by performing orbital tuning. Astronomical cycles recognised through a time series analysis on specific parameters or chemical elements will allow to tight the age of the sediments with a resolution of 20-50 ka.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Continental rifting represents the initial, fundamental step in the plate tectonic cycle, as it ultimately leads to continental breakup and the formation of ocean basins. The sequence of fault nucleation that occurs during initial rifting and the evolution of strain rate with time is poorly known due to deep burial of early syn-rift sequences today preserved at passive margins. IODP Expedition 381 will investigate the Gulf of Corinth rift system to reconstruct the time and space evolution of tectonic strain and the timescale of fault evolution during initial rifting. These goals will be achieved by building a high-resolution chronostratigraphy of the drilled sequence and correlating it to the known rift structural pattern. Understanding the orientation of the tectonic stresses and their variation with time, however, is also necessary to fully reconstruct the kinematic of initial rifting, which in turn may provide key insights into the poorly defined geodynamic causes of the Corinth rift formation. This project will use anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) analysis to reconstruct in time the orientation of the paleo-stress field and its intensity. This will provide unique constraints on the style of the tectonic forces that controlled the formation of this continental rift. The main outcomes of this project will fulfill the specific Expedition 381 objectives of understanding continental rifting processes. By integrating AMS results with those from Expedition 381, this project will provide the first high-resolution tectonic model of an active continental rift system, which will be of high relevance to both the IODP and tectonics community.

How continents break up leading to the birth of ocean basins represents an outstanding question in plate tectonics that attracts a tremendous public interest. Besides the benefit of this project to a diverse range of disciplines in Earth Sciences, including plate tectonics, marine geophysics, and seismology, its main impact lies in the potential to engage members of the public and school/college students in seafloor exploration and plate tectonics. The potential for impact in this area will be enhanced by a number of short-term activities, including:

This post-cruise research project will provide the opportunity for young scientists at Birmingham to build specific hands-on skills on laboratory analyses by performing non-destructive, repeatable experiments (such as magnetic anisotropy) on samples recovered at Expedition 381. This may include, MSc or PhD students of the University of Birmingham, as well as interested visitors. Such experience has real potential to motivate and inspire students and young scientists by engaging them in real international projects and introduce them to IODP research.

The University of Birmingham organizes regularly educational talks opened to the entire university and non-academic community interested in Earth Sciences topics. IODP science is certainly one of the most exciting aspects of research in Earth Sciences, which has the potential to attract a large audience. Furthermore, the Lapworth Museum located on main campus represents one of the key contact points between academia and the local community, with thousands of visitors every month. A series of educational talks for non-specialists are organized during the Earth Science Week once a year in October. Dr Maffione is already involved in this program and will deliver in 2018 a set of talks on IODP science, with a particular focus on the outcome of recent projects, like Expedition 381.

The large amount of available samples, together with the non-destructive character of magnetic anisotropy analysis make this project ideal to deliver active research-led teaching in tectonics. Dr Maffione leads two modules on tectonics and structural geology for Year 1 students, and will introduce IODP research to his students to inspire them and shape the next generation of Earth scientists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28363</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R013942/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>401A9A9F-83DF-48FD-B108-C4CC7FB7572C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tectonic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
