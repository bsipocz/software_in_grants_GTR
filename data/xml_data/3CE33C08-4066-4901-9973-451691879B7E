The UK Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is responsible for policy on the natural environment, marine and fisheries, food and farming, animal and plant health, and rural communities. The broad remit of Defra means their evidence needs are substantial and cross multiple disciplines. Strong links between government and the wider research community are therefore particularly important for improving the access and use of evidence in policy development and evaluation. 

The Defra Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA) and strategic evidence and analysis teams are responsible for Defra's approach to the acquisition and use of evidence to inform strategy, policy and operational delivery. The fellowship will work with Defra's CSA to promote knowledge exchange between academic organisations and Defra to provide research-informed evidence to develop and review policy. 

The aims of the fellowship are to: i) Help drive improvements in the evidence base and its use in Defra by providing high-quality, strategic analyses of challenging science-policy issues; ii) Work with the CSA and Defra evidence teams to support the development of Evidence Statements for science-policy issues; iii) Support the development of other innovative approaches to the management and use of evidence in Defra as it develops the Evidence Investment Strategy; iv) Provide the CSA and Defra with assessments of emerging scientific issues of importance to Defra's remit; v) Act as a conduit between Defra evidence teams and the wider academic community, and facilitate new links and networks.

The outcome of the fellowship is improved use of evidence for policy decisions. Specifically, the outcomes and impacts of the fellowship are: i) A series of assessments of high-profile science policy issues to support the CSA in improving the use of science and evidence in Defra; ii) The development of Evidence Statements in partnership with Defra evidence teams to enable policymakers to benefit from the widest and most comprehensive evidence base; iii) The development of innovative mechanisms for the management and use of evidence in Defra, including arrangements for working with external experts; iv) New and strengthened links between Defra and the wider research community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Quality Framework for Evidence Reviews Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B9086DA-2EC9-4AA1-A5A4-1F12D412625E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One-day workshop on reviewing evidence for policy decision-making. The objectives of the workshop were to: i) Raise awareness in Defra of methods available for reviewing and communicating evidence, ii) Improve understanding in Defra of the sources of bias affecting evidence reviews.

Policy makers need reliable information in order to develop evidence-based policies. The volume of information generated on environment, food and rural issues is vast, making it difficult for policy makers to efficiently integrate information for rational decision making. Reviewing evidence reduces information into manageable nuggets, separating insignificant, unsound or redundant information from the salient. Common methods of reviewing information (e.g. literature review and expert opinion) are useful but may not detect all information required for rational decision making. There are methods available that can increase the credibility and transparency of evidence review findings. The aim of the talk was to: i) Outline the principles of systematic methods for reviewing evidence, ii) Discuss the strengths and limitations of the difference evidence reviewing methods available, iii) Provide practical tips on how to search, appraise and summarise evidence to achieve reliable, credible and transparent findings. 

Members of policy and evidence teams attended; the presentation was distributed to evidence teams across DEFRA; several requests received for further information; and it was reported that some attendees had changed their practice to reflect some of the considerations raised in the seminar.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e00d9cb8a643.98731029</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Evidence review workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7C904B1F-2EA5-4088-B1D3-C4C3579873A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop brought evidence review experts and government decision-makers together for the decision-makers to learn from the experts and provide feedback on what works in policy.



The workshop:
- Initiated the development of a set of guidelines on conducting evidence reviews for policy makers in Defra. 
- Created new links between evidence review experts and policy makers
- Led to the suggestion of future similar meetings with a wider audience</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54610cda298dd9.84290144</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>40082</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NERC Policy Placement Secondment to support Defra's Chief Scientific Advisor</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NE/L008599/2</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>57AA7CAD-F2AC-4B5A-9B1D-81D87A3FFB28</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c3f9cbc1f852.11633695</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My work with the Defra Chief Scientific Adviser is contributing to improving the use of high-quality, unbiased evidence for policy-making.
