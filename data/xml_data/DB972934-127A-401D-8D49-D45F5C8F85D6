Linked to the appearance in 1965 of the Sony Portapak, the first portable video camera, or to the first video exhibition 'TV as a Creative Medium' (Howard Wise Gallery, New York, 1969), its conceptual origins can be traced back to Spazialismo, the art movement founded by Lucio Fontana (Milan 1947-52). Historiographies have often emphasized a pervasive American influence on the evolution of this art form particularly since by the end of the 1970s American museums, including the Whitney and the MOMA, added video to their curatorial departments, thus contributing to the survival of the medium.\nTraditionally, the history of Videoart in Europe has been of interest to restricted circles of specialists, although programmes devoted to the preservation of analogue videotapes have appeared in several European countries: the Netherlands Media Art Institute, The Video Data Bank Denmark, France Heure Exquise and ZKM in Germany. Recently, the inception of Videoart in Britain, has been the concern of the AHRC funded REWIND: Artists' Video in the 70s &amp;amp; 80s research project (2004-08) www.rewind.ac.uk. Such a project, whose aim was to encourage the re-exposure of a significant period of video production in Britain to a wider audience constitutes the intellectual springboard for the proposed REWIND ITALIA: Videoart in Italy 1968-81.\nThe reiteration of the iconic term 'rewind' in our new project's title signals a continuity of aims, (within a culturally distinctive context like the Italian one) and our confidence in the validity of established research skills, methodologies and institutional context (Duncan of Jordanstone at the University of Dundee - an institution with an excellent track record in managing significant research grants).\nThe impetus behind the REWIND ITALIA project stems from the consideration that Italy was a vibrant centre of Videoart production and exhibition throughout the 1970s. All the more remarkable because of the international reach of the work produced. Some of the artists connected to the Italian video centres include well known names such as: V. Acconci, J. Baldessari, C. Boltanski, D. Buren, G. De Dominicis, A. Kaprow, J. Kounellis, M. Abramovic, S. Bussotti, G. Cattani, C. Kubish, N. J. Paik, J. Shaw, P. Weibel, B. Viola. This early work laid the foundation for Videoart, thus it is only timely that its history and the social, cultural and economic circumstances that characterized its rise and, ultimately, its fall into critical oblivion are finally brought to light. \nIn detail, REWIND ITALIA will focus on the activities of video production and documentation of three centres: Art/Tapes/22, run by Maria Gloria Bicocchi in Florence (1973-76),the first European studio for artist videos; the Centro Video Arte run by Lola Bonora in Ferrara (1972-94), a rare example of public sponsored videoart, and the Galleria del Cavallino based in Venice and run by Paolo Cardazzo. Between 1974 and 1981 the Galleria produced over one hundred videos shown in several (inter)national exhibitions. In addition, the project will consider the rich video tape collection of Luciano Giaccari whose group Studio 970/2 was interested in using the new medium for artistic documentation (see for example the 'Television as Memory' project, 24 hours no-stop Theatre, Varese June 2nd 1968).\nThe activities of the above centres have received only scanty international exposure, (an exception is the exhibition Art/Tapes/22, Long Beach,CA. University Art Museum, 2008). To date, no critical overview of the above experiences has been produced. Also, there is an urgency to this research, illustrated by the fact that the pioneers mentioned above (Bicocchi, Bonora, Cardazzo,Giaccari) are already in retirement. Their impact on the history of video as an art form has for too long escaped the recognition that they so unequivocally deserve.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The knowledge and understanding developed by the project will be of interest to individuals and organisations that have a remit to study, promote and exhibit video art, including contemporary art museums, international film and video archives, universities, media art centers, media theoreticians, art history scholars and critics. The output from the 'Rewind Italy' project will disseminate knowledge with regards to a crucial period in the history of video to both scholars and the public in the UK and internationally through the website, the symposium/conference and screening, and the publication. \n\nThe publication will become a definitive document on the period and is intended to promote international interest and a scholarly re-assessment of the medium in the context of contemporary electronic media practices. After the funded project phase we anticipate and will facilitate interest from curators, and liaise with them on further screenings and exhibitions. The Investigators will also present papers at appropriate international conferences on video art, focussing on conservation and heritage IP issues, beyond 2012. The Research Fellow will have considerable impact upon the academic community in Italy, not least because of the project's exemplary status as an arts and humanities-funded project, and its team-based character, a somewhat rare event in the Italian context, outside of archaeology.\n\nBeyond the academic arena, the project has the potential to deliver a number of benefits to the Culture, Heritage and Public sectors. For example, the REWIND research team has considerable experience of negotiating license agreements with artists, the details of which will be offered to the research communities through associated knowledge exchange efforts, including presentations, visits, symposia and publications. Furthermore, the documentation of the project will provide the blueprint for other cultural and public bodies to engage in the development of their own open source archiving and dissemination activities. There may also be, and we would seek, interest from broadcasters.\n\nThe Interviews will create considerable interest worldwide. The Italian curators and artists (including Bill Viola) will attract many visitors to the project resources on the website, gradually developing the project's significance and subsequent impact.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>216733</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Careof DOCVA, Milan

The symposium was a &amp;quot;research event&amp;quot;, focused particularly on the experimental video produced in the period (1968-1982), addressing several artistic tendencies and interpretative paths, including both pioneers and most recent artists and critics. Among the participating artists were: Claudio Ambrosini, Theo Eshetu, Luca Maria Patella, Federica Marangoni, Luigi Ontani, Michele Sambin, Mario Sasso, Guido Sartorelli, Luigi Viola. Attending curators included: Maria Alicata, Stuart Comer, Deirdre McKenna, together with gallerists, accademics, critics, art historians and media theorists such as: Renato Barilli, Achille Bonito Oliva, Silvia Bordini, Valentino Catrical&amp;agrave;, Eleonora Charans Sean Cubitt, Giorgio De Vincenti, Bruno Di Marino, Lia Durante, Francesca Gallo, Marco Maria Gazzano, Luciano Giaccari, Laura Leuzzi, Angela Madesani, Dino Marangon, Anna Mazzanti, Silvia Moretti, Anna Notaro, Steve Partridge, Anne Marie Sauzeau, Lorenzo Taiuti. The journalist Mario de Candia, the director Carlo Quartucci, the performer Carla Tat&amp;ograve; and the operators Carlo Ansaloni and Angelo Bacci will also be attending. 
Interdisciplinarity of approaches reflected in a stimulating and insightful discussion with several questions and comments from the audience. Following to this event REWINDItalia team member were invited to present at Roma Tre, DOCVA (Milan) and Videoex Festival (Zurich).
