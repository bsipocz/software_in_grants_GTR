Although successful in the laboratory, transition to the clinic is proving more difficult. These problems likely arise because tumours create a protective microenvironment, to which our immune system is ineffective. 

Non-cancerous cells in the tumour form a supportive network known as the tumour stroma. We do not yet fully understand how the stroma promotes tumour development, or how it contributes to the related immune dysfunction. Tumours induce the growth of lymphatic vessels within the stroma. There, lymphatics drain fluid from the tumour, but also act as the route by which tumour cells spread. Additionally, lymphatics connect a tumour to our immune system. So, how, although connected to our defences, can a tumour evade immune destruction?

We believe that rather than simply providing structural support to a developing tumour, the stroma has a much more active role in establishing the protective microenvironment and ultimately making a tumour more difficult to treat. Our research uses state of the art in vitro and in vivo systems to determine how the stroma, the cells it interacts with, and the physical forces experienced by these, impact tumour development; and ultimately, how we can exploit these feature to more effectively treat cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There is much excitement about exploiting our immune system to fight cancer instead of more conventional cytotoxic drugs. While successful in vitro, transition to the clinic is proving more difficult. These problems likely arise because tumours create a protective microenvironment, to which our immune system is ineffective. Non-cancerous cells in the tumour form a supportive network known as the tumour stroma. We do not yet fully understand how the stroma promotes tumour development, or how it contributes to the related immune dysfunction. Lymphatics within the stroma drain fluid and proteins from the tumour, while acting as a highway for spreading tumour cells, but they also connect the tumour to our immune system. Therefore, the question arises as to how, although connected to our defences, can a tumour evade immune destruction? Recent evidence suggests that some cancers develop a stroma with features common to the specialized stroma of the lymph node (where immune system decisions are made) and may help silence the anti-tumour immune response. This &amp;quot;lymph node (LN)-like&amp;quot; stroma also shares characteristics with lymphatics. These overlaps point to an intimate relationship between lymphatics and stroma in the establishment of the tumour microenvironment. 

We hypothesize that rather than simply providing structural support to a developing tumour, the LN-like stroma is a major factor contributing to immunological tolerance and tumour progression, and that the dynamic biophysical and biochemical environment created by lymphatic drainage function is integral to the formation of this stroma. Specifically, these interactions culminate with a stroma capable of a) posing as a chemokine source in response to physical cues, b) sequestering chemokines and cytokines at the tumour, c) restricting particulates/dead cells to the tumour zone, masking them from the immune system, and d) directly presenting tumour-associated antigens to immune cells within the tumour.

To evaluate our hypotheses we combine in vivo tumour models and 3D, tissue-engineered in-vitro systems that mimic the biophysical tumour-stroma-lymphatic microenvironment. Such complex in vitro models permit us to explore the interplay between interstitial flow and LN-like stroma; specifically, to determine to what extent direct cell contacts and interstitial flow (alone, or in combination with tumour derived factors) influence stromal phenotype and function. In vitro, however, we cannot account for host responses and so turn to in vivo models. We will employ genetic mouse models including lymphatic deficient mice to determine how the absence of lymphatic drainage impacts LN-like stroma development and how later restoration of the lymphatic network affects tumour fate. Similar models, and in vivo tracer studies will provide insight into the capacity of LN-like stromal cells to behave like their LN relations and control immunological fate of the developing tumour either by direct presentation of antigen or ?molecular sieve? function. Stromal cells can be isolated from tumours and ex vivo assays determine their capacity to present antigen. 

These projects will give vital new insight into how tumour-associated stroma supports skin cancer development, but will have the broader implications of identifying a potential alternative therapeutic target - the tumour stroma.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>571669</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Cancer Cell Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>Molecular phenotyping as a novel method of lymph node tracking in oesophageal cancer</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E73D083-2DBA-4CB5-BF32-82B57F8EA4CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>BRhZaTizYkw-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>manpower, insight into mechanisms of lymph node metastasis in human oesophageal cancer</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>provision of materials and establishment of novel assay systems</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in MRC Festival of Science Open Day 2016 at MRC CU</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D9514C2E-81F4-46B9-B12D-C5F5E1F03936</gtr:id><gtr:impact>60 sixth-form students from across 8 schools in Cambridge visited the MRC Cancer Unit on the afternoon of the 22nd of June, 2016 for an Open Day. All students, accompanied by their teachers, were given a tour of the enitre building with an opportunity for engaging with researchers about the state of the art in cancer research and gaining hands-on experience with setting up experiments. Talks about career opportunities and challenges associated with pursuing cancer research were also available to all attendees. The event sparked a great deal of interest and enthusiasm in students and teachers alike and we have had a request for this event to be continued. We will be pursuing a similar format of activities for the MRC Science Festival in 2017, but reach out to more number of schools, including those outside of Cambridge city perimeters.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a336a8486c44.23435514</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://mrccancerunit.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/inspiring-the-next-generation-of-cancer-researchers-the-mrc-cancer-unit-open-day-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Feature in Cambridge News</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76AB721B-6074-4D7F-951F-FD8690372884</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Appeared in a feature on the Unit in the Cambridge News, the city's local newspaper which has regional reach across the county.

It is a free event, over two weeks, with an excess of 270 events and more than 30000 attendees. As part of this festival, the MRC CU along with the CRUK CI organised a set of talks and activities that were attended by over 100 people from all walks of life - from young children and young adults to parents/carers and professionals. The Shields lab was part of the MRC CU team at this event. Overall, the event generated a lot of interest in cancer research, helped raise awareness about the importance of 'early' in cancer which is the mission of the MRC CU and also led to a lot of interest being generated in the MRC Festival of Science which followed on later in the year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a337f5daa5f2.37776841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge Science Festival 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>458A1C78-423C-4650-A0F4-F872ED2CE7BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Spoke to public about research and coordinated activities about the cell matrix
