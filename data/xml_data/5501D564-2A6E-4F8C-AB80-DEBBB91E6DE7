And if it decides to stay? 

Over the past two years, the UK Government has undertaken a review of the way in which powers are shared between the EU and the UK, across the range of policy areas in which the EU can act. The purpose of the Balance Of Competences review is to assemble a body of evidence to help decide whether or not continued membership is in the UKs national interest. But the consideration of what is in the national interest may look very different from Cardiff, Belfast or Edinburgh than it does in London. Devolution has meant that the devolved administrations have the power to adopt their own laws on certain matters, and differences are starting to emerge across the UK in the laws that may apply. Policies may have very different impacts across the different regions of the UK. 

To adopt its own legislation, Wales, as with the other devolved powers, needs to have been given the competence to do so. It also has to ensure it is complying with the requirements of EU law when it legislates. Whilst there may be (un)popular images of EU law requiring exactly the same rules to be applied across all the countries of the Union, scope for differences certainly exist. The purpose of this project is to examine the Balance of Competences review from the perspective of devolved power. Does the account of the law, and of who does what, in the review, clearly reflect what is in the competence of the devolved administrations, and what remains in the power of the central UK political institutions? Is it clear from a devolved perspective what the consequences of any returning of legal powers to the UK from the EU would be? When would Wales be able to maintain the laws it already has, and when would this only be possible if a new devolution settlement was agreed? Could, legally, Wales be able to do what Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Woods suggests when she argues that 'If powers are to be repatriated, there should be specific attention as to which parliament takes up those repatriated powers, and not the automatic default that everything goes to Westminster. For example, on social measures, Wales should be allowed to 'opt-in' even if England chooses not to do so.'

The project will seek to bring clarity to the allocation of legal competences, and highlight the manner and extent to which the relationship Wales has with the EU is shaped through the machinery of Westminster and Whitehall. As well as offering impartial independent explanations of the legal frameworks that apply across a number of key policy areas, the programme will also undertake new research on the way the interests and concerns of the devolved powers may be fed into the EU decision making process. This is through an investigation into the recently acquired powers for national parliaments to make representations to the EU Commission that proposed laws should be handled at a national or regional level instead of at EU level, as their objectives can be achieved without the need for EU legislation. The research will explore how this 'subsidiarity review' is operating within the UK, looking at the relationship between the Welsh Assembly, the other devolved parliaments, and the UK Parliament.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The key impacts expected from the research are located primarily within the area of :
Increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy. 

Who will benefit from the research?
The primary beneficiaries are envisaged to be - 
General public
Civil society representatives and interest groups
Businesses
Officials and politicians in devolved assemblies
Officials and politicians in central UK political institutions

How will they benefit from the research?
General public - the research will provide outputs that should lead to a better understanding by the engaged general public of the consequences of any renegotiation of UK's place in EU, and may be a factor in their decision whether and how to vote in elections and referenda. This will be particularly tailored to those in Wales, highlighting the legal consequences for Wales and the powers it holds. 

Civil society and interest groups - the outputs of the project will provide them with the opportunity to better target their resources to the appropriate level of decision making - both current and prospective, and to develop appropriate strategies. 

Businesses - economic actors will benefit from a clarification of the different legal contexts which may apply and impact upon them depending on whether policy areas are repatriated. 

Officials and politicians in devolved assemblies - the research will benefit officials and politicians by clarifying the legal powers held by Wales when implementing/otherwise operating within the scope of EU law, and explaining when differentiated solutions may be pursued. It will make explicit the legal consequences for Wales of the renegotiation of the terms of EU membership. In respect to the strand of the project looking at subsidiarity, it will provide evidence which seeks to lead to more effective engagement on the part of the Welsh assembly with the EU institutions and the UK parliament. Officials and politicians in other devolved assemblies may draw comparative insights from the findings for Wales. 

Officials and politicians in central UK political institutions - the dissemination of research outputs will lead to a better appreciation of the legal powers held by devolved administrations, and the variegated consequences for repatriation of competences across the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174990</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation at the European Week of Regions and Cities, event organised by the European Commission and the Committee of the Regions</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C90E163D-CF8F-4B9C-A236-C768B2DC1604</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event was a four day event entitled 'Regions and cities for sustainable and inclusive growth' and covered all aspects of regional economic development policy design and implementation.Practitioners were interested in the future relationship between the EU/UK and what type of regional policy could evolve.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6e01aaa4206.76595507</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/regions-and-cities/2016/main_programme.cfm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Evershed/IWA Brexit Event 10 October 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49FD2C8A-C5ED-4658-B644-43243F9422CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Speaker at the event &amp;quot;Brexit: What will it mean for Wales to leave the EU?&amp;quot;, other speakers politicians and leading lawyers

'We broke the EU debate down into five key areas and teamed up with the UK in a Changing Europe programme to ask top academics to record short videos on each area. We then went to the two official campaigns to get them to make their case.
These videos are at the heart of our Better Referendum meetups - those that didn't have the time to find a meetup or organise one, could watch the videos here'.
I contributed to two of these videos as an expert commentator (social policy and regions and nations). These vidos were shown as packages in meetings across the UK and could also be accessed directly on the ERS site.

Each discussion included a Q&amp;amp;A, providing an opportunity for the audience to ask questions to the speakers.
Speakers included: Lord Dafydd Wigley (Plaid Cymru), Berwyn Davies (Business consultant), Nathan Gill (UKIP), Dr Joanne Hunt (Cardiff University School of Law and Politics and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'), Baroness Julie Smith (Liberal Democrats), Dr Rachel Minto (Cardiff University School of Law and Politics and 'The UK in a Changing Europe').

I have become a very frequent commentator on Brexit and legal issues on Welsh, UK and international media, and participate regularly in public events. Our work here has informed the public in an accessible way about Brexit matters. 
The second strand has been on the impact of Brexit on the powers and legal competences of Wales, and has involved work for an academic audience, and also considerable engagement with policy makers and politicians. Team members have been very active presenting evidence to Westminster and devolved parliamentary committee inquiries, and speaking to policy makers and politicians in other fora. There is evidence of impact on planned activities by the Welsh Assembly in the area of regional policy. In addition, work we have undertaken on the move to a model of shared governance post Brexit and the appropriate underpinning principles has been discussed in committees and drawn on in policy documents. Additionally, the consequences for devolved powers of the demands of a UK internal market has had particular traction. A presentation on the concept and its consequences was made to the UK Parliamentary EU Committee chairs in December 2016, leading to a follow up request for information from a Committee members. This internal market point was also a discussion topic in the Wales Government/Assembly event on Great Repeal Bill and Repatriation of Competences, and is influencing thinking.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E3FB51F6-6294-4F35-B439-3A295F4BFC9D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c9fece601fc3.77319886</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The original project was set up to look at the issue of where powers will return to on Brexit. The research funded on this grant has highlighted the extent to which the current devolution settlements are underpinned by the UKs EU membership. The political context has evolved such that the existing devolution settlements will almost certainly require change, and new UK wide frameworks developed. The research we have undertaken has been at the forefront of developing thinking around the structures that may be required for decisions to be taken, and the principles that need to underpin them. In particular, the project has focused on subsidiarity, and, distinctively, on the demands of a UK wide internal market once the UK leaves the EU single market. This will have UK wide consequences. We have also focused on Wales-specific issues, highlighting issues that the Welsh government need to give attention to in the Brexit/repatriation process, and the current limitations in their powers to be able to do this effectively. In policy terms, we have placed a particular emphasis on the area of regional funding, and other place- based policies, including agriculture.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings around the impact of withdrawal from the EU on devolution provides a resource for the UK Government and Welsh Government, and their parliaments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D18F516E-753E-4CB2-9744-5CE90A1797BC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bc69775c87f4.71571287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Oral Evidence to House of Lords EU Select Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FE40379F-5421-43AE-BD14-5AD28E1D16E7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bc59f97603d0.49643619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Gave evidence to National Assembly for Wales External Affairs and Additional Legislation Committee on International legal framework and trade September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D88D52EC-FA3F-4F18-8BCB-585285B77BD8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c98cf98b9aa7.59958728</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://senedd.assembly.wales/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=449&amp;MId=3714&amp;Ver=4</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contributed to UKICE written evidence to the House of Lords EU Select Committee Inquiry on Visions of EU Reform</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92329A86-B70C-4003-BE22-508419FC7501</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c1969264dfa1.98244764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/eu-select/visions-of-eu-reform/the-eu-referendum-and-eu-reform-evidence-volume.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Gave evidence to National Assembly for Wales External Affairs and Additional Legislation Committee on Intra-UK Intergovernmental Relations November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6843CD01-C30F-4FAF-8F4B-56D38514AB66</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c98d87255076.75212268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://senedd.assembly.wales/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=449&amp;MId=3779&amp;Ver=4</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Oral evidence to House of Commons Committee on Exiting the EU</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>55E5CE7B-972B-4A11-925D-743E4AF283C4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bc54198db343.53836960</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Gave evidence in the National Assembly for Wales' Inquiry into Regional Policy - What next for Wales?</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>50A1FCB3-4D11-4F88-948C-B3A530FF500F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d29b43dea5.55388169</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://senedd.assembly.wales/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=449&amp;MId=3927&amp;Ver=4</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Gave evidence to the House of Lords EU Select Committee Inquiry on 'EU Referendum and EU Reform, Cardiff October 2015.
