'maker culture' or the 'making movement') has gained impetus with the increasing availability of low-cost microprocessor-based platforms, affordable 3D printers and lasercutters, and an online community sharing best practice and crowdfunding new projects. This has the potential to enhance UK manufacturing, multiply access to new products and encourage new forms of DIY. So far, however, these technologies have mainly been confined to FabLabs, Maker Faires and Hackathons, and used primarily by self-identified 'geeks' for self-motivated projects. Only a small proportion of schoolchildren have access to making activities despite wide interest because expertise and resources are lacking, and more generally these technologies remain practically inaccessible to the majority of the population.

Citizen Naturewatch will bring digital making to a new and broad UK audience by linking with the BBC's award-winning Springwatch series to produce collections of bespoke digital devices that viewers can make at home. 

Springwatch, produced by the BBC Natural History Unit over an intensive three-week period, is shot live from a home base usually located in a nature reserve. The core of the show consists of footage gathered from numerous outdoor cameras that film birds and animals throughout the site, as well as footage from other locations, all strung together, enlivened and enriched with commentary from expert presenters. The devices we build will add to this content by supporting people from around the UK to collect images, sounds and data that might be used on the show. The devices will be developed in consultation with the Natural History Unit as well as other relevant expert groups, and might include systems for photographing, weighing and even identifying local birds, or for tracking foxes, watching fish, or counting hedgehogs. The aim will be to produce designs that are engaging, easy and affordable to build, and which produce content worthy of showing on Springwatch. 

We will produce an initial set of designs and kits to try out with 'seed groups' including makers, students and wildlife clubs. With their help we will refine the designs for release as open-source specifications to reach the widest possible audiences. With promotion by the BBC, and easy to follow instructions including videos, we anticipate them being taken up by hackers, hobbyists, student clubs and birdwatching groups all over the UK. Over the course of two Springwatch cycles, we will develop the designs, and the publics who engage with them, as a resource that can augment Springwatch's existing content. 

Springwatch is already a world-leading example of public engagement with environmental science. This project will support this mission by allowing people to gather their own environmentally-relevant data and content. In the process, we will support public engagement with new technologies as, motivated by the chance to contribute to the show, a range of students, hackers and nature lovers try out, modify and build the devices we come up with. Thus Citizen Naturewatch will serve as a powerful impetus to involve a wide public to engage in digital making activities. With the BBC helping to publicise the project, activities in schools and maker spaces, and a domain that should attract a wide variety of younger and older participants, the impact will potentially be to inspire and inform a wide range of UK citizens to engage with the latest technologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is not only an integral outcome for the Citizen Naturewatch project, but an essential mechanism for its operation. We see impacts being made across three broad groups of non-academic and commercial beneficiaries: the BBC, the digital making communities including commercial concerns, and a more general public including schools.

We expect impact on the BBC throughout the project. The impact will initially be felt within the Natural History Unit and the Springwatch series, but will spread to other areas of the company such as the Make It Digital. Given the BBC's track record for innovative change that has transformed broadcasting, we are confident that broader impact will also be felt across the television industry as our approach is shared using the BBC's networks and influence. We hope that the success of this project leads other other popular series about wildlife take up our approach of disseminating open source devices for capturing television-worthy content.

How they will benefit:
- Naturewatch devices will provide new content to the Springwatch series that will broaden their appeal to viewers. This will include the data collected, engaging examples from individual participants, and appearances by participants on the show.
- Audience participation with the devices will help the series move a broadcast model towards a more inclusive model of engagement in which citizens will provide content and also potentially change the nature of questions and content being considered.
- Content captured by the devices may be uploaded to the BBC website between Springwatch events, keeping the series 'live' throughout the year.
- The devices may be distributed via the Make It Digital campaign, benefiting that campaign with new content, Springwatch with more participants, and the organisation though greater coherence among departments.

We expect impact on digital making communities and associates commercial outlets to start about halfway through the project, once an initial collection of device designs is released. 

How they will benefit:
- Naturewatch devices will provide a powerful marketing tool for workshops, classes, etc. 
- The shared focus on a recognisably worthy topic will reach new communities and offer new focus for digital making activities.
- The designs may help form bridges between digital maker groups and schools.
- The designs will benefit commercial operations such as ProtoPic and Maplins with new customers for their equipment.

Finally, we expect strong impact on the publics who engage with the Springwatch series, including groups already concerned with nature and the environment, as well as secondary and possibly primary schools, with the potential of after-school clubs forming around digital making, seeded by Naturewatch kits.
How they will benefit:
- Citizens will gain greater insight into UK wildlife and environment through engagement with Naturewatch devices and associated features on Springwatch.
- They will also benefit from better awareness of ubiquitous, mobile and IoT technologies through discussions of the devices and particularly by building their own.
- Local nature organisations will benefit from the devices in their ongoing activities, including for instance using the content they collect in negotiating environmental protection at local levels.
- Schools will benefit from the potential of using Naturewatch devices both within lessons about the environment and technologies, and for afterschool activities.

We expect initial impacts to be established within the course of the project, as two tranches of kit and Springwatch programmes immediately bring the results of our research to the various publics discussed above. The benefits will continue beyond the immediate project through the people who build and modify the kits, and potentially through the BBC and other broadcasters as they adopt the link between programmes, citizen science and open source making more generally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>771440</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P006256/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
