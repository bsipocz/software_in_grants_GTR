Rwanda</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L009811/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>How can a country express the complexities of life after genocide? In Rwanda, twenty years after the violence that killed up to a million people, writers, artists, filmmakers and journalists have been working hard to communicate difficult choices made by the government, local organisations and civilians whilst reconstructing the country. Much has changed: a generation of young people have grown up since 1994, and Rwanda has experienced unprecedented economic success. However, internationally the country is still primarily associated with the moment of genocide.

In August 2012, the AHRC &amp;quot;Translating Freedom&amp;quot; network hosted a workshop in Kigali to discuss how life after genocide is mediated through transitional justice processes and the arts. One key issue emerging from our conversations was Rwandans' lack of control over images of their country circulating internationally. Photographs of Rwanda are predominantly taken by visiting outsiders and very few Rwandan photojournalists and artists have access to international networks. 

In response to this gap, King's Cultural Institute have funded a photography workshop in Kigali in November 2013. Facilitated by Nigerian photographer Andrew Esiebo and Magnum photojournalist Dominic Nahr, Rwandan participants will be mentored in developing their own unique narratives. 

The &amp;quot;Visualising Transformation in Rwanda&amp;quot; project will enable these images to reach a wide international audience through an exhibition at Somerset House, curated by culture and genocide specialist Dr Zoe Norridge, Rwandan artist Christian Nyampeta and Autograph ABP Director Mark Sealy MBE. The exhibition will coincide with the twentieth anniversary of genocide in Rwanda and will constitute the first exhibition about life after genocide by multiple Rwandan photographers to be shown internationally. 

Somerset House, with its central London location and extensive marketing networks, offers an ideal platform for bringing together new audiences. The famous courtyard is a respectful setting for commemoration activities and the exhibition will introduce visitors to previously unseen images that reflect upon the past and celebrate change since genocide.

One of our key objectives for the exhibition is to connect people who commission photography with Rwandan photographers. Too often, international NGOs, media organisations and gallery spaces send international photographers to Rwanda to take images for fundraising and awareness raising campaigns, news stories and exhibitions. By engaging with Rwandan photographers directly these commissioners could support local artists whilst also gaining unique insights into life after genocide.

The ways in which a country represents itself influence national identity, international relations, tourism and global public perceptions. But often in the aftermath of violent conflict, governments, foreign aid agencies and NGOs focus exclusively on development priorities such as health, poverty reduction and education. By foregrounding the role of the arts in changing national and international perceptions, we will contribute to a growing body of evidence about the ways in which artists can assist with post-conflict recovery through our policy briefings.

Collaborations are vital to the success of the entire project. The curation is a partnership between King's, Autograph ABP and Rwandan artist Christian Nyampeta. In Rwanda we are working with Carole Karemera (Ishyo Arts), John Mbanda (The New Times), Illume (creative agency) and Inema Arts Centre, amongst others. 

This exhibition has the potential to demonstrate that Rwandans can set research agendas, that impact activities resulting from research can affect international creative industries, and that universities can play an active role in highlighting global inequalities. Above all, it will ensure that Rwandan-authored narratives commemorating the twentieth anniversary of genocide are seen internationally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how?

Rwandan nationals

This project stems from a need identified by Rwandan participants at the Kigali &amp;quot;Translating Freedom&amp;quot; workshop in August 2012. As such, a key group of beneficiaries are Rwandans themselves - both in Rwanda and in the diaspora - who are keen to see Rwandan-authored images of their country circulating on the international stage, which will be achieved through our exhibition. Our curation will be grounded in ongoing dialogue with Rwandan stakeholders and we will seek coverage in the Rwandan as well as the UK press. We are in discussions with the Aegis Trust and SURF Survivors Fund to reach the widest possible audience in the UK (and Northern European) Rwandan diaspora.

Rwandan photographers

This exhibition offers a unique platform for Rwandan photographers to access international networks and markets. Copyright for the images will remain with the photographers and we will provide contact details for potential buyers. Most importantly, through our private view and workshop, photographers' work will be seen by international professionals who commission photography in Rwanda, opening up future opportunities.

UK cultural gatekeepers 

We are organising a workshop to connect professionals who commission photography for NGOs, international media and exhibitions with Rwandan photographers based in Rwanda. This will assist commissioners in working directly with Rwandans and ultimately offers an opportunity to save money by working with photographers in-country rather than paying travel costs for international photographers. 
 
UK NGOs and government agencies

Our policy briefing document resulting from the workshop and exhibition will provide information about and guidance on the need for international support for the arts in post-conflict societies. Highlighting a gap in current funding patterns, the briefing will hopefully support international agencies in changing existing practices, with photographers and service users in country further benefitting from any change.

UK public

This exhibition will bring new material to the UK general public, enriching visitor understanding of life in Rwanda after genocide. The central London location, free entry, and Somerset House marketing will assist in reaching the largest possible audience. Media activity around the exhibition (facilitated by our PR agency and Dr Zoe Norridge's ongoing links with Radio 3) will extend the reach of the project. 

Curators

This will be the first exhibition that Zoe Norridge and Christian Nyampeta have curated. Mentored by Mark Sealy and supported by the King's Cultural Institute, both curators will gain invaluable experience relevant to their ongoing work with Rwanda. 

Students

Undergraduates and graduate students stand to benefit from visual work that has not been seen in the UK before, offering both context for the study of post-genocide societies and material for research in its own right. The exhibition period covers both term-time and school holidays - offering potential for the involvement of school students and their teachers.

Academic beneficiaries

The primary academic beneficiaries of this exhibition will be international researchers examining representations of life after genocide in Rwanda. Whilst the project focuses on photography, it will also appeal to academics exploring literature, film, theatre and dance within the wider context of memorialisation and identity in Rwanda. In addition, it has appeal for academics working on cultural responses to other genocides and scholars specialised in African art, and the politics of representation more widely. The exhibition will also be relevant for social scientists researching memory, transitional justice and reconstruction after genocide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41008</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Rwanda in Photographs: Death Then, Life Now.

The event brought many members of the Rwandan diaspora into King's College London for the first time. It demonstrated the university's engagement with international collective memory and memorialisation. Many commented on the dignified, warm and diverse nature of the event.

The event raised awareness of the photographic exhibition amongst the Rwandan diaspora based in the UK. Many of the Rwandans who attended the commemoration went on to attend subsequent events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cfa206b0a17.65291890</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cultural/culturalinstitute/showcase/past/pp/1314/talksevents/Rwanda-events-programme.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KCL Cultural Institute Short Film</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F6F4D711-6989-42EB-B821-16FC292DC05A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>King's Cultural Institute commissioned short films about selected projects to showcase their work with the cultural industries.

Impact included:

1) Directly communicating the complexities and achievements of Rwandans twenty years after the genocide to visitors through the London exhibition, international media coverage and international talks. 

2) We now know that communicating such complexity through a visual medium increases positive attitudes towards Rwandans. We have yet to explore the long-term impact of this attitudinal change but it is likely to include reduced prejudice and increased support of international collaborations amongst the UK public.

3) Connecting Rwandan photographers with international networks, generating possibilities for international professional representation, further training and commissioned work. This has an economic impact for all professional photographers working in Rwanda.

4) Mapping the ground for changes to the commissioning of photographs of Rwanda by international cultural gatekeepers. This is a long-term project with the potential for significant impact to the ways in which Rwanda is visually represented internationally, changing public perceptions, creating economic opportunities for Rwandans and potentially offering cost savings for NGOs and government departments working in Rwanda.

5) Bringing together stakeholders from a range of different fields including transitional justice, publishing, film, politics and NGOs to appreciate the importance of authorship in visual images of Rwanda. These interdisciplinary conversations across disciplines and professions (both academic and practitioner) will hopefully change the ways in which participants commission and use photography in their own practice.

6) Students, academics and members of the public participating in exhibition events had the opportunity to engage with Rwandan cultures in a manner that is usually impossible outside of Rwanda. Again, we hope this will change the questions they ask about visual authorship both professionally and personally. We know from our evaluations and anecdotal conversations that the events were certainly enjoyable and thought-provoking.

7) King's College London was able to develop a significant partnership with Autograph ABP that has potential to grow as we extend the work on the visual representation of Rwanda. This has a potential impact on the ways in which academic-creative collaborations are perceived within both institutions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ECCF88EF-6031-4E6E-8319-6E7C3971EA80</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545f79bd9b3d33.04487737</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This follow-on funding grant for impact and engagement resourced the exhibition &amp;quot;Rwanda in Photographs: Death Then, Life Now&amp;quot; in the Inigo Rooms, Somerset House East wing. Alongside the exhibition we ran a series of public events and a professional workshop. 

Four of our key discoveries from this grant were:

1) There is an enthusiastic audience for Rwandan authored images. In the UK this audience included members of the public (both from the UK and overseas), members of the Rwandan diaspora, photographers working internationally, and practitioners and academics engaged with issues relating to post-genocide Rwanda. UK and international media (including Times Higher, CNN, Vox Africa, Arise TV and Thomson Reuters) were willing to engage with the work but placing images with UK broadsheets was much more challenging. 

2) This said, there is little international will to seek out Rwandan authored images, even during special periods such as the twentieth commemoration of genocide. Ours was the only exhibition in the UK and overseas, tied to commemoration, that featured work by Rwandan photographers. There is a great deal of work to be done raising awareness of the importance of authorship in the visual field for Rwanda and other post-conflict countries.

3) Viewing work by Rwandan photographers increases perceptions of Rwandans as intrinsically human. We now have robust quantitative data showing that encountering such work changes attitudes across groups. This will be extremely helpful when making the case for funding other artistic interventions and projects to support changes to commissioning practices.

4) Factors driving the commissioning of international photography are highly complex. Whilst most professional photo editors and agencies who attended our professional workshop expressed willingness to commission Rwandan photographers, our conversations showed these professionals still perceive barriers in accessing and trusting local photographers. Policy briefings alone are insufficient to address these issues. Instead, coherent training schemes (developing both artistic and business skills), infrastructural change (better access to high speed internet connections and web resources), the development of a local and regional photographic culture, increased professional representation (agencies and festivals) and changes to commissioning practice (longer lead times, greater development of regional staff) are required for long-term change to be achieved.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A large number of people will play a role in taking forward the findings from our exhibition and related events.

1) Rwandan photographers had the opportunity to meet international cultural gatekeepers at the UK professional workshop. They have taken these networks back to Rwanda. Resulting projects include: discussions about professional representation by two photo agencies (Majority World, Plus 25); strengthening of Rwandan professional associations and networks; additional training offered by Laura Pohl (who attended our professional workshop) around business management and photo editing; Kigali Slideluck photography showcase running in Rwanda in November 2014.

2) Rwandan artists and members of the diaspora in the UK were inspired by the work and will hopefully initiate further artistic projects exploring Rwandan authorship in an international context. We are still in discussions with artists who were directly (Ery Nzaramba, Christian Nyampeta) and indirectly (Ishimwa Mhimanyi) involved.

3) We have now established a key network of photo editors and agencies committed to commissioning Rwandan imagery, if ongoing barriers can be resolved. Some members of this group have undertaken individual projects involving training and mentoring (Save the Children, Grow Movement, Carol Allen Storey, London College of Communications).

4) PI Dr Zoe Norridge is applying for an AHRC Leadership Fellowship to complete her own monograph to communicate the findings from the exhibition and initiate further network collaborations supporting long-term change in the development of a photographic culture in Rwanda and revisions to current international commissioning practices.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7280076C-DF2E-4BB6-B50F-303F2E3FFE12</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f7960eb53a7.44710956</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Photography Professional Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>159B92A7-6D7F-4B1D-BA44-8E787121C020</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact from this professional workshop is still evolving.

We circulated a summary document reflecting the findings of these discussions that will soon be available on the Autograph ABP website. We also intend to seek further funding to explore key issues identified. Participants agreed to work towards changing commissioning practices which has the potential to: change public perceptions of Rwanda, increase income for Rwandan photographers and save money for NGOs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545d02413ed379.74624206</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L009811/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>69128365-74B2-4A08-8067-57863ECCB013</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>African Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AB8E72DD-E988-47DA-B01A-BE9012CC89A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conflict/War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
