It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox. The main symptom is a painful rash, which is followed by itchy blisters. It is estimated that around one in every four people will have at least one episode of shingles during their lifetime. Risk factors for getting shingles include older age, having an immunosuppressive condition and taking immunosuppressive medication. 

Shingles tends to be self-limiting; after about 1 month the pain and rash will have disappeared. However, some patients will develop shingles-related complications. In a group of one hundred patients over sixty years of age with shingles, around 10 will develop long-term pain, called postherpetic neuralgia, and around four will develop complications around the eye, such as conjunctivitis. A series of other complications have been described, including complications involving internal organs, the skin and the nervous system. Many of these can be very serious and even life-threatening, resulting in high health and social care costs. Together, an estimated 4 in every 100 patients will have one of these additional complications. However, reliable data on the numbers affected and who is most affected is limited.

So why is this of interest at the moment? There are two shingles vaccines licensed for use: the live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax) and the newer subunit vaccine (Shingrix). Countries, including the United Kingdom, now face a decision about which vaccine to use. A better understanding of these additional complications of shingles will be helpful for policy makers deciding upon a shingles vaccination strategy. 

This research project will use routinely collected medical data from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, to get a better idea of the number of people developing zoster-related complications. It will also assess how much the shingles vaccines protect against these complications and use these findings to inform public health assessment of these vaccines.

The findings from this work will greatly improve our understanding of shingles and will eventually lead to better prevention of serious zoster-related complications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Herpes zoster is a painful rash, arising from the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) following reduced cell-mediated immunity. Risk factors for zoster and its most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), include older age and poor immunity. Although uncomplicated zoster is a mild, self-limiting condition, serious cutaneous, visceral, neurological and ocular complications can occur; some lead to severe illness, high healthcare costs and mortality, such as stroke, encephalitis and pneumonia. However, our knowledge on the frequency of, and risk factors for, complications (besides PHN) is limited. 
 
A single-dose, live vaccine against zoster (Zostavax) was licensed in 2006 by the FDA; vaccine effectiveness is around 50% for zoster and 60% for PHN. It is approved for use in over 60 countries including the UK. In 2017, a non-live and more efficacious two-dose vaccine (Shingrix) was recommended for immunocompetent adults over 50 years old by the US CDC and initial analyses suggest it would be good value. Its use is under consideration elsewhere, including the UK. 
 
With countries facing the decision of which vaccine to use, and which patients to vaccinate, understanding the epidemiology of zoster complications and accounting for them in cost-effectiveness analyses will help inform vaccine policy. This research project therefore aims to quantify the relative and absolute risks of complications following zoster, assess the effectiveness of zoster vaccines and antivirals against these complications, and utilise these findings to inform public health assessment of the cost-effectiveness of zoster vaccines. This project will use routinely collected electronic healthcare data from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. 

Understanding the epidemiology of zoster complications will inform zoster vaccine decisions in the UK and elsewhere.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>285711</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S003940/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
