Owing to the dearth of individuals who can take advantage of large biological data sets, we have decided to focus the UK's ELIXIR node on training.

This is the century of biology, and genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics ('omics and bioinformatics) lie at its heart. The computer is an essential tool and now drives many critical aspects of the scientific process hence scientists need to know how to gain most advantage from it. Despite the central role of computing in science today:

- Most research scientists are ill-equipped to take advantage of the data 'bonanza' that is emanating from new technologies. Critical training needs across the community are, broadly, in the analysis and the interpretation of genome-scale data of many types, including next generation sequencing (NGS) data. Genomics is the area of greatest training need as it lies at the intersection of many fast-moving research disciplines.

- Many infrastructure technologists (career bioinformaticians) are ill-equipped to offer scalable, sustainable solutions for managing and interpreting data arising from this flood of technological advances. Critical training needs are in techniques and practices for data management, integration, compute and software, tools, services and standards.

The ELIXIR-UK Core Organisations are: the Universities of Oxford, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Edinburgh; the NERC Environmental Omics Synthesis Centre; the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; the Genome Analysis Centre; and, University College London. Additional participating organisations are: the Software Sustainability Institute UK; the Hartree Centre; and the University of Dundee. Other organisations (UK and ELIXIR-wide) will be incorporated to provision training.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Node's training mission will be delivered in four ways:

(a) The organisation of training through ten cooperating Training Sectors where UK skills are strong, training needs have been identified, and training capabilities already exist. Each sector is led by established researchers in their fields, and many co-operations between the Sector Leads already exist. Each Sector Lead is responsible for: (i) representing the sector at initial Training the Trainers (TTT) events; (ii) organisation of an initial workshop that performs a training gap analysis for the sector, and (iii) fund-raising for resources that aim to plug these training gaps. 

(b) These training gaps will also be filled by trainers' skills being developed by workshops that exchange ideas and best practice among sectors. ELIXIR-UK will be particularly supportive of training delivered at the
interface between different sectors. Existing training resources will be collated and new training materials
developed and disseminated at every opportunity.

(c) The development of a pilot Training e-Support Service platform that will seek, among other things, to offer the crucial means of registering and discovering training materials, face-to-face training opportunities
and training-relevant resources, and will progressively deliver forms of training online. A feasibility study will
be undertaken on whether pipelines could be developed to permit ELIXIR trainers to disseminate their own
training content on-line, whilst maintaining a separate copy in their home training institution.

(d) Development, management and monitoring of outcomes of the training activities through three posts who (i) support the Training Sector Leads, (ii) coordinate the redefinition of of training agendas with UK scientists, industry, grant-giving bodies and other ELIXIR Nodes, and (iii) will foster, mentor and support the community of trainings, across all sectors, in the UK and Europe.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>For Academic Impact please see 'Academic Beneficiaries'.

Industrial Impact.
Industry has a critical requirement for data sources, data integration, visualization and analysis tools, and for training related to these, across the broad spectrum of data types relevant to life sciences. The ELIXIR WP3 industry report refers to: protein and nucleotide sequencing; genomic information; genetic variation; small molecules; proteomics; transcriptomics; macromolecular structures; scientific literature analysis; ontologies or controlled vocabularies; and pathway and interaction information. In the pharmaceutical, consumer goods, consumer markets and agri-food sectors small molecule data, protein sequence and structure, as well as pathways are of critical importance. Genomic data, genomic variation, and links to phenotypes are important in plant and animal breeding. Food security can only be supported by scientifically driven research and by making the fruits of this research available to academic, governmental and industrial scientists. Scientists in large companies, medium and small size organizations can be overwhelmed by the complexity and volume of data. Repetition of in house custom solutions is not cost effective so a new landscape of pre-competitive collaborations is emerging. Training in understanding ranges of data types, interactions and agile integration are pre-requisites for efficient industrial research. Tools such as semantic web data integration techniques, controlled vocabulary / ontology definition and metadata capture are key for modern data driven biological research but adoption of these techniques in industry will require education and training. ELIXIR-UK will engage with industry in a number of ways:
- through industry organisations such as EFPIA, Pistoia (Pharma), and BioNOW (BioTech SMEs), systematically developing those links to inform its training content and training methods;
- awareness raising in industry of ELIXIR tools and resources, and providing training in them;
- packaging platform distributions such as BioLinux in other informatics sectors, such as cheminformatics;
- using industry for provisioning training and hosting training events;
- brokering access to high-end training needs in ICT literacy (e.g. HPC).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1031384</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education &amp; Training</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Connecting GOBLET and ELIXIR</gtr:description><gtr:id>8CCCBA74-E822-4349-9219-47039A9BCC4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training workshops e.g. https://www.elixir-europe.org/events/elixir-ukgoblet-training-workshop</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf52c4543898.88936392-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>ELIXIR-UK brokered the formal partnership between ELIXIR (www.elixir-europe.org) and GOBLET (mygoblet.org/) to coordinate training and the training community across the European Life Sciences.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>ELIXIR-UK brokered the formal partnership between ELIXIR (www.elixir-europe.org) and GOBLET (mygoblet.org/) to coordinate training and the training community across the European Life Sciences.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bangor University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>North Wales Organistion for Randomised Trials in Health (NWORTH)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Development of training in Genomic Medicine for Wales</gtr:description><gtr:id>7617A0C5-C147-493B-9136-866CAA630FB7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are no outputs yet - the MSc programme is currently under validation at Bangor University with the intention of a September 2017 intake.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c58ba70581a6.25558519-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Bangor University has committed School and College-level staff to the development of the MSc programme internally, as well as incorporating development of the NHS workforce in Wales in genomic technologies into their development strategy.

ELIXIR-UK is the BBSRC/MRC/NERC funded UK node within the ELIXIR infrastructure in the European Union and focuses on bioinformatics training provision in partnership with other European ELIXIR Nodes. ELIXIR-UK has prioritized 5 critical areas of UK training need. Metabolomics is one of those priorities and this collaborative effort will be key to engaging the community and addressing the emerging skills gap.

Although we are a not at a point in the project to see this yet - we are already beginning to see benefits arising from our collaborative and community-focussed approach. Many different institutes, funding bodies, professional societies, companies and industry bodies are reviewing training and skills gaps. As we work with those different groups we are finding areas of mutual interest/benefit, opportunities for collaboration - and also opportunities to reduce duplication of effort - and this sharing approach is leveraging greater value from the different investments (both financial and time) each of these groups represents.

Openness and sharing of training and skills-related data, knowledge and expertise is beginning to change the post-doctoral training landscape, particularly with the industry we engage with starting to view training as part of the pre-competitive workspace. As we foster community and bring these traditionally separate groups together in thinking and planning for future development in training provision, we begin to have the opportunity to impact on earlier skills development, influencing higher education curricula at pre and post-graduate - to doctoral level. This will have much further reach and impact on training gaps in the future and bring sustainability to the efforts of producing a more skilled life science base in modern (and future) data-driven biology.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ED2A6A5F-DD30-4709-810A-F136C93913B2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b9c6e3b1e45.83562810</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>ELIXIR UK set out to assess the current state of training in the UK that helps biological science researchers make use of the large, high-throughput datasets that are now being produced by modern laboratory methods such as next generation sequencing technologies. To do this, we have set up working parties to look at several different fields of life science research - with the purpose of surveying current training availability, gaps and training needs; and to develop a strategy to address the training needs of life scientists across academia and industry - both in the UK and wider into Europe.

To date, our sector-specific working groups have undertaken surveys and consultations - delivering comment, review and opinion on training provision and need. We have seen that there are training requirements due to emerging technical or funding priority areas, some arising due to novel opportunities across the boundaries of traditional scientific disciplines, or where there is a systematic gap in basic education/training which is becoming acute due to modern data-analysis requirements (specifically training in statistics).

ELIXIR UK is making results of this process available to the wider community, whilst developing a training development strategy focussed on 5 strategically important, priority training areas, in: Structural Bioinformatics, Clinical Genomics, Advanced Scientific Skills, Metabolomics, and Applied Genomics. 

The next stages of the project will build on this ground work - supporting activities of our sector working groups and building capability and training specifically in our strategic priority areas. Continual liaison with Industry is key as well as with other stakeholders, both at national level and across the wider pan-European ELIXIR community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By making our survey and consultation results publically-available, and in making our processes, aims, objectives and working practices transparent; the wider community - both within the UK and across the pan-European ELIXIR partners - will be able to reflect on their own training needs and provision. 

ELIXIR UK will be focussed on transitioning from identified gaps in training towards a comprehensive and current training portfolio available to the UK life science community, by using our network of subject experts to plug training gaps.

As we engage with local academic and industry partners, national stakeholders and European collaborators, we will be developing not only training materials to address the needs/gaps we have highlighted - but also metrics and guidelines, examples of best practice, and providing frameworks for working together that will enable widespread development and adoption of related training and approaches wherever needed. 

By providing technical platforms and infrastructure to support the training effort, along with advice, expertise and resources to develop and support trainers we will build a wider community participating in training for the future - based on the principles and ethos of that developed by ELIXIR and ELIXIR UK.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A353B28F-F748-4E6E-B8D0-B952A13A5D9F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b6a66894060.45774874</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.elixir-uk.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input on skills needs for the development of the Science Industry Partnership strategy (ELIXIR UK cited)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91E6C26C-D909-44C2-AE24-FF5B0DDDAE82</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c5870190fe92.45636011</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.scienceindustrypartnership.com/skills-strategy/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Support and input to the development of the European Metabolomics Training Coordination Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9432097E-F2CE-41B5-A0DD-97D6DB3CEC41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>EmTraG's mission is to harmonise metabolomics training across Europe in order to improve its scientific coverage, geographical reach, quality and impact, thereby empowering the next generation of analytical, computational and applied metabolomics scientists.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c56fcf5fb5e9.92847561</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.emtrag.eu/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input to Welsh Genomic Medicine Task Force - Developing a strategy for genomic and precision medicine in Wales</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7EDC6711-9B6D-4309-AB4B-7AA7D8BF235F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c56e43469514.93465497</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input on skills needs for the development of the Association of the BioPharmaceutical Industry skills report (ELIXIR UK cited)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0D7F2B2A-CCA8-4D3A-B411-2C754DD61424</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c588024fb058.08380180</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.abpi.org.uk/our-work/library/industry/Documents/Skills_Gap_Industry.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The StaTS project portal has been produced to further the aims of the StaTS working group in widening access to, and improving availability of, introductory training and support in statistics for life scientists.
