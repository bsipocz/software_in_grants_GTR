The use of light scattering to study both the motions and structure of material building blocks is a powerful way to learn about materials. However, in order to investigate a material using light the material normally needs to be highly transparent to light. Unfortunately, most materials are not transparent, but show various degrees of optical turbidity. If one attempts to study such a turbid material using light scattering, the result is normally very difficult or even impossible to interprete. However, the particular light scattering technique termed 3D-photon correlation spectroscopy gets around this problem by using a trick. 
Generally, when studying a material by the use of light, a laser beam is focused upon your material of interest, light is scattered and you detect the scattered light for some particular scattering angle. By analyzing the time-varying intensity of the scattered light you can work out how the units within your samples that are responsible for the scattering move and by studying how the time-averaged intensity of scattered light varies with the scattering angle you can work out how the scattering units are arranged or what shape they have. The problem comes, as mentioned above, if the sample is turbid. This means that light is generally scattered many times before it exits the sample and the information about the scattering event gets lost. The trick utilized in the 3D-PCS technique, is that the incoming beam is divided into two and each of these two beams is focused into the same sample volume. Here, they both undergo scattering and by analyzing both these scattering events simultaneously, one can find those scattering events where light was only scattered once within the volume and thus no confusion will remain in terms of interpretation. 
This powerful light scattering technique is thus excellent for studying turbid materials such as many gels, emulsions, biological materials. In fact, materials where it is important to understand the motions and structure of the building blocks over a wide range of time- and length-scales, but where the materials are not optically clear are so common that researchers within physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, engineering etc are interested in having access to this technique. Moreover, since industrially relevant materials are perhaps even more likely to be turbid than the more 'purified' materials used in university labs, the interest in applying this technology to study materials relevant for industrial products such as plastics, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, or advanced materials for drug delivery or batteries is huge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The 3D-Photon correlation system will be unique to the UK and only a small number of these systems have been manufactured world-wide. Moreover, the particularly strong capabilities of the Leeds set-up, with the latest options installed for optimal accuracy and high signal-to-noise ratio, with excellent hardware for proper measurements on systems such as gels or glasses that are out-of-equilibrium, and with high class polarization optics enabling measurement of both translational and reorientational motions makes this kit one out of a handful world-wide. Access to this system should impact a long range of different scientific and industrial discisplines within physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, food science, engineering etc and the equipment will be of significant strategic importance due to its impact on our understanding of turbid materials such as colloids, surfactant systems, polymers, gels, glasses, microgels, emulsion or bio-macromolecules. These types of materials are essential to a range of key focus areas for UK technology such as medical, pharmaceutical and food technologies and the ability of 3D-PCS to study such materials where other techniques fail will impact key sectors of our society and economy, including personal care, pharmaceuticals (aging population), nuclear and renewable energy (sustainability) and agrochemicals and advanced engineering materials technology (manufacturing the future). The strong support received for this proposal from industry already highlights the potential this technique has to revolutionise our understanding of may difficult to study materials, which have hitherto remained properly investigated. In the industrial Letters of support, it is e.g. stressed how important and difficult it is to try to understand the formation and breakage of non-equilibrium gel structures, where formulation testing is a key bottleneck in progressing new products to the market; to have access to this unique technology which can study the detailed dynamics and structure in these highly turbid materials could lead to a significant move forward not just in the fundamental sciences, but also in a wide range of practical applied problems. It is also pointed out that there are a wide range of UK companies for example within the food, petrochemical, dye and pharmaceutical sector that have very similar interests. This is further illustrated by the strong interest in a UK-based 3D-PCS set-up from Chamelic, Escubed, Infineum and Unilever. Moreover, The fact that 3D-PCS is ideal for studies on slow dynamics, dynamic arrest and out-of-equilibrium behaviour strongly adds to its importance; this research area was recently highlighted by the EPSRC signposting &amp;quot;Matter far from equilibrium&amp;quot;. The strategic case is further strengthened by the fact that 3D-PCS is an excellent and unique research tool in 3 out of 4 of the recently identified EPSRC Physics Grand Challenges: &amp;quot;Emergence and Physics Far from Equilibrium&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Nanoscale Design of Functional Materials&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Understanding the Physics of Life&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;. It is also important to point out the close relation between the physics of non-equilibrium solids and non-equilibrium behaviour in large-scale systems such as traffic systems, animal populations, human societies or financial markets, all of which are areas of significant importance to the UK society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157821</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at the British Society of Rheology Midwinter meeting 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54901876-E8EB-4333-B94C-213E95A06EE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An oral presentation given by PhD student Juliette Behra with the title:&amp;quot;From dilute to concentrated polyelectrolyte solutions: understanding sodium carboxymethyl cellulose chain dynamics in water with rheology and light scattering measurements&amp;quot;.

This light scattering technique is used for the study of a wide range of soft matter systems where turbidity and thus multiple scattering of photons is a problem. This experimental technique makes it possible to perform full angular dependent light scattering investigations even in highly turbid media. The technique is being used on concentrated colloidal suspensions to study their structure and dynamics as well as in polymer gels, biological aggregating systems and a wide range of concentrated particulate or polymeric systems both of fundamental and applied and/or industrial importance. The technique has been used to study the details structure, dynamics and mechanics in soft colloidal systems which has resulted in a better understanding of the link between rheology on the local particle scale and that on a macroscopic sample scale. The techniques has been used on a range of industrially motivated polymer systems including carboxyl methyl cellulose solutions as used in wide variety of products and pectin as used in food products. In the former case, the technique has been a key component together with rheology in identifying the physical processes underlying the behaviour of these polymers at different concentrations and the effects of addition of salt to the solutions; these are questions that address a wide range of industrial questions. For pectins the light scattering technique has been used to outline the detailed gelation behaviour both in aqueous solutions of pectins and in solutions with added sugars where the gelation can be controlled by addition of Ca. Moreover, a wide range of other systems have been investigated including colloidal system consisting of hard and soft particles, advanced supramolecular polymeric systems and systems focused on Li-ion battery technologies where polymer-based gels are used as the battery electrolyte and the formation and behaviour of these gels are key to understand in order to develop efficient processing routes for Li-ion batteries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are actively interacting with the equipment manufacturer LS-instruments to further improve the technology. We are also actively interacting with other researchers both within Academia and Industry to identify areas where the experimental technique can address important questions within soft matter science.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AC527D03-3342-43F8-B3A7-A141FCA38395</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>543c3fa5affff2.28046969</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Course material for light scattering teaching</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F3F4D59-D90A-4243-B080-CBF507C79BAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of teaching for light scattering, particularly on the 3D-PCS equipment at the University of Leeds</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c871a78c16.85108111</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A 3D-Photon correlation spectrometer has been installed in the School of Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy in Leeds. This equipment is unique in that it makes it possible to perform both static and dynamic light scattering on materials that range from optically transparent to opaque. Thus, both the arrangements and the movements of material building blocks such as colloidal particles, emulsion drops and protein or polymer chains can be studied in detail using scattering even if the dispersions are turbid.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7356283E-A512-476C-A815-84AE5A456AF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This technology has and is strongly benefitting the work both on finished grants and on several studentships connected to grants as outlined in the documentation.
