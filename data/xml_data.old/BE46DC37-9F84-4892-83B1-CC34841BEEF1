The study has considered approaches to research and development from academia and practice. Relatively little theoretical and empirical research has previously been undertaken as to how arts and cultural organisations define and approach research and development. The work was commissioned as a qualitative study. 

Stakeholders confirmed the need for a 'research and development' definition of the arts and cultural sectors in order to:

? make research and development a tangible and understood practice, albeit one that might extend and evolve in the future. By making the practice tangible resources can be actively shaped and managed.

? highlight where and how research and development is delivered. It was noted that many parties deliver research and development but do not formally brand it as such. This means that at present there is not a clear picture of the practice and value of research and development. 

? aid collaboration and understanding across those domains delivering research and development. 

? provide a focus for policy makers and funders.

? foster greater understanding with the wider public.

? provide parity with the science sector where an agreed definition has resulted in policy and tax breaks around that definition

The study has taken into account the viewpoints of those from beyond the traditional boundaries of academia, i.e. those undertaking research beyond the walls of the HEFE sector, research stakeholders and beneficiaries more widely. The study affirmed the need of research and development in order to deliver new knowledge, new human experiences and innovation. Research and development puts in place systems for pushing boundaries whilst minimising uncertainty.

The participants identified that there was a need for a definition which extended from the arts and cultural sectors to the science sector and therefore provided for collaboration between different spheres rather than putting up barriers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research and development definition developed and tested with core stakeholders is a major step forward for research and development in academia and practice. In 2016 the definition will be disseminated through an article and a conference paper. 

Further work on measuring research and development will be undertaken. Case studies are being prepared for policy makers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52722507-DB22-4CB6-B915-59EDD653A5C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d757998b59b2.23274171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2347E0F9-2461-4152-BAEE-176FAF4208FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Defining R&amp;amp;D for the creative industries</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a7340d4137494870cdfdcb4a596e8f50"><gtr:id>a7340d4137494870cdfdcb4a596e8f50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bakhshi, H.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b995ce635170.85738084</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3685938F-5ADE-4F5E-B9E0-E44A7BFE93EF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Defining R&amp;amp;D for the arts and cultural knowledge domains</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d1e10a142cf0cdb3e45db53e39f6aa4d"><gtr:id>d1e10a142cf0cdb3e45db53e39f6aa4d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lomas, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b99506b3e572.84477330</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L503988/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
