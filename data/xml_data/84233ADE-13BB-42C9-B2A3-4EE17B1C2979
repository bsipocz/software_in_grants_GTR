Today, the theory is deeply intertwined with other areas of mathematics such as ergodic theory, dynamical systems, fractal geometry, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. It also has links to theoretical computer science and theory of differential equations. At the same time, Diophantine approximation continues to play a significant role in applications to real world problems including those arising from the rapidly developing areas of electronic communications, antenna design and signal processing.

The main aim of this research project is to investigate Diophantine properties of generalized Mahler numbers. The project contains genuine aspects of interdisciplinarity via (i) the interaction between Diophantine approximation properties of automatic numbers and wireless communication, and (ii) the interaction between Mahler numbers and the long-standing Hartmanis-Stearns conjecture in computer science.

One of the main goals of the proposed research is to develop a general criterion that enables one to determine whether or not a given Mahler number is badly approximable or not. This goal is naturally connected to the task of determining the irrationality exponent of a given Mahler number. At present, the techniques available are rather limited and existing results are established on a case by case basis. A general criterion would be highly desirable. Recent publications discovered interesting possible approach to this problem, which still needs to be developed.

Continuing with the theme of irrationality exponent, another key goal of the research is to develop a general criterion that guarantees a given generalized Mahler number has a finite irrationality exponent. This avenue of research will be further extended to determine the class of generalized Mahler numbers that do not belong to the class U of Mahler's classification of real numbers.

Another aim of the proposed programme is a well-known conjecture that Mahler numbers are either rational or transcendental. This conjecture is important from the point of view of the general transcendence theory, and also because it has links to theoretical computer science. The proposed research will seek a complete resolution of this conjecture and indeed investigating its analogue for generalised Mahler numbers.

An important part of this project is to build upon the existing collaboration with engineers to find and solve theoretical questions emerging from signal processing. This is aimed to facilitate and accelerate the development of models favouring the emergence of new technologies in wireless communication.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research project primarily aims to develop new techniques and establish new results on Diophantine approximation. Moreover, it aims to enhance the links of Diophantine approximations, and more broadly of Number theory, with fields outside of the mathematics such as electronic engineering and computer science. Definite and topical applications of recent advances in the theory of Diophantine approximation are currently evolving in the rapidly developing areas of electronic communication, antenna design and signal processing; in particular, in order to investigate the potential of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technologies. These technologies have attracted attention in wireless communications for their high efficiency and reliability and are having a significant impact on modern mobile communication standards. Mobile communications change fast with consumer demand growing. Wireless technologies are used in all walks of life including computing, media and business. The fundamental research addressed within this programme will enhance any development process involving ideas from number theory, adding to the store of knowledge that underpins technology. The scope is potentially huge, with savings made in the communication equipment and more efficient energy factors. This contributes both to wealth creation and the improvement of quality of life.

It is worth emphasizing that exposure to problems in the 'real' world and trying to understand them mathematically can lead to ground breaking advances, which in turn can have a major impact on both the 'real' and 'abstract' worlds.

The proposed research also contributes toward the research excellence of UK science. The UK has extremely strong tradition in the field of Diophantine Approximation and the novel nature of the proposed research will build upon this tradition and enhance the UK's leadership in the field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4E497499-9A07-4DEF-95FD-21E7005B9429</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Minimum of a Positive Definite Quadratic Form over Non--Zero Lattice points.
