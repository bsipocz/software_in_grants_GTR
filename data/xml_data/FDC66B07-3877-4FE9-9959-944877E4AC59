Things</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N02334X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Today we use many objects not normally associated with computers or the internet. These include gas meters and lights in our homes, healthcare devices, water distribution systems and cars. Increasingly, such objects are digitally connected and some are transitioning from cellular network connections (M2M) to using the internet: e.g. smart meters and cars - ultimately self-driving cars may revolutionise transport. This trend is driven by numerous forces. The connection of objects and use of their data can cut costs (e.g. allowing remote control of processes) creates new business opportunities (e.g. tailored consumer offerings), and can lead to new services (e.g. keeping older people safe in their homes).
 
This vision of interconnected physical objects is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The examples above not only illustrate the vast potential of such technology for economic and societal benefit, they also hint that such a vision comes with serious challenges and threats. For example, information from a smart meter can be used to infer when people are at home, and an autonomous car must make quick decisions of moral dimensions when faced with a child running across on a busy road. This means the Internet of Things needs to evolve in a trustworthy manner that individuals can understand and be comfortable with. It also suggests that the Internet of Things needs to be resilient against active attacks from organised crime, terror organisations or state-sponsored aggressors. 

Therefore, this project creates a Hub for research, development, and translation for the Internet of Things, focussing on privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security/safety: PETRAS, (also suggesting rock-solid foundations) for the Internet of Things. The Hub will be designed and run as a 'social and technological platform'. It will bring together UK academic institutions that are recognised international research leaders in this area, with users and partners from various industrial sectors, government agencies, and NGOs such as charities, to get a thorough understanding of these issues in terms of the potentially conflicting interests of private individuals, companies, and political institutions; and to become a world-leading centre for research, development, and innovation in this problem space. 

Central to the Hub approach is the flexibility during the research programme to create projects that explore issues through impactful co-design with technical and social science experts and stakeholders, and to engage more widely with centres of excellence in the UK and overseas. Research themes will cut across all projects: Privacy and Trust; Safety and Security; Adoption and Acceptability; Standards, Governance, and Policy; and Harnessing Economic Value. Properly understanding the interaction of these themes is vital, and a great social, moral, and economic responsibility of the Hub in influencing tomorrow's Internet of Things. For example, a secure system that does not adequately respect privacy, or where there is the mere hint of such inadequacy, is unlikely to prove acceptable. Demonstrators, like wearable sensors in health care, will be used to explore and evaluate these research themes and their tension. New solutions are expected to come out of the majority of projects and demonstrators, many solutions will be generalisable to problems in other sectors, and all projects will produce valuable insights. A robust governance and management structure will ensure good management of the research portfolio, excellent user engagement and focussed coordination of impact from deliverables.

The Hub will further draw on the expertise, networks, and on-going projects of its members to create a cross-disciplinary language for sharing problems and solutions across research domains, industrial sectors, and government departments. This common language will enhance the outreach, development, and training activities of the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Privacy, Ethics, Trust, Reliability, Acceptability, and Security in the Internet of Things, (&amp;quot;PETRAS&amp;quot;), concerns us all. Being able to understand, control, and exploit their interaction in this space will have huge societal, economic, and third sector impact - let us mention personalised healthcare, better transport experience, more effective energy and water supply, more robust facility and supply chain management, new economic mechanisms for data sharing, and trust relationships of particular interest to the third sector. 

The Hub's strategic focus is on co-designing solutions in this socio-technological space that are acceptable to their users and that judiciously, if not optimally, trade off conflicting considerations such as security and cost-effectiveness. The Hub will create and provide an environment in which researchers, users, and partners from multiple sectors can bring together expertise, experiences and experimental environments to engage in such co-design. This approach has impact and effective value generation at its core: the Hub has already secured pledges of considerable funding from partners who provide this support for research with impactful outputs; also, the Hub's overall strategy, governance structure, and operational oversight are designed to nurture and evaluate impact and productivity -generating activities - as reflected, for example, in the criteria for internal project selection in the initial and future internal calls. 

One large environment for impact creation will be The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Within it, the &amp;quot;Smart in the Park&amp;quot; initiative - led by UCL and partnered with The Mayor of London's Smart London Board - has provided full and open research access to the study of PETRAS aspects of the entire site infrastructure: from waste and water through to energy, lighting, smart homes, future retail, and the logistical complexity of 9.5 million annual visitors across the 257 acres site. The pathways from this research to impact are 6-monthly &amp;quot;Smart in the Park Events&amp;quot;, and IoT Weekenders linked to the Future Cities Catapult and the Digital Economy Catapult to showcase research. Additionally, workshop space for PETRAS R&amp;amp;D will be provided to SMEs, think tanks, and innovation incubators within a planned long-term IoT showcase called &amp;quot;The Heart of the Park&amp;quot;. All this will be enhanced by facilities that engage citizens with PETRAS and the Internet of Things, such as controlling park lighting via the Internet of Things. We will have similar impact activities for other demonstrators such as the Smart Streets in Lancaster, Wearable Devices in Healthcare in London, the Smart Campus in Surrey, and the Edinburgh Festival. 

The Hub will have two full-time Impact Champions serving in key management roles of the Hub; they will ensure that our approach to impact will be agile to allow the Hub to learn from seed projects, and will be inclusive to support an innovative environment in which also disruptive research and development can flourish. Through its linked, nationwide network of experimental environments, exhibition spaces and showcases the Hub will foster impact generation through co-innovation such that outputs have global reach and will help to secure the UK as a world-leader in PETRAS research in the Internet of Things.

PETRAS aspects of the Internet of Things are clearly visible to the general public, policymakers, and decision makers. Therefore, the Hub will maintain and lead a dialogue with those groups and others regarding the importance of PETRAS aspects in our future lives. This is aimed to be high profile, aided by a professional media campaign engaging with the full spectrum of today's media. The Hub will also tap into existing outreach channels such as a Hub website, UK Museums, Academies and Professional Societies. The aim is for the Hub to become an authoritative global voice of PETRAS/IoT aspects, and to create brand value for its long-term, sustainable and impactful future</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4559840</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The development of humanised IoT devices has created an emerging discussion around 'Smart Gnomes' aimed at deployment around QEOP.

This second church was selected for this work as, aside from the significant distance between the two locations (approx. 370km), there is a significant contrast between the typically younger and relatively static community at St Peter's, and the typically older community of St Michael's which is extended in the summer months by many tourists to the Lake District who visit the church. Of particular interest will be the extent to which it is possible to develop a 'community spirit' between the two churches, the extent to which the two communities are able to feel empathetic towards the other, and the potential for the development of pro-social and pro-community behaviours between the two communities.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Siemens AG</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:department>Siemens Mobility</gtr:department><gtr:description>Siemens Mobility Letter of Support for PETRAS Internet of Things Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3395F68-14E3-4413-88AC-C950A5468A84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Siemens Mobility have written a letter of support committing their resources to the furtherance of this project.

L-3 TRL is an agile UK-based technology company, which designs and delivers advanced electronic systems for the protection of people, infrastructure and assets.
We operate in the fields of electronic warfare and cyber security, creating scalable solutions by investing in innovation and delivering excellence. Working in partnership with defence and civil organisations, we respond to their requirements, delivering precisely the right product at the right time, helping to counter evolving and emerging threats worldwide.
The research to be conducted in the Central Hub for Advanced Research in IoT (CHARIoT) supports work currently being conducted as part of the innovation programme within L-3 TRL. This work aligns with our strategic model, supporting our entry into the marketplace as a supplier of innovative and trusted solutions for loT Cyber Security and Secure Cloud Infrastructure.

L-3 TRL are a critical enabler for the adoption of IoT security and greatly wish to support the CHARIoT in order to meet the challenges of:
(i) Implementing safe and secure applications on resource-constrained lightweight loT devices, including compromise detection and the application of appropriate compromise responses,
(ii) Securing the requisite enterprise management services hosted by cloud providers,

L-3 TRL has a history of investing in strategic collaborations with major security vendors and with world leading Universities. We develop market leading products and research in the field of cyber security and high grade/high bandwidth cryptographic solutions. Our technical ability and market reputation underpins the objectives of this proposal for a Central Hub for Advanced Research in IoT. We are currently funding research into mobile cyber security at Warwick University with a final value expected to be circa &amp;pound;100,000.
The proposed research collaboration with the CHARIoT consortium will work alongside our in-house teams to support and extend our loT and cloud security service investigations. As part of the proposed collaboration with the CHARIoT consortium, L-3 TRL offers staff time for consultancy, guest lecturing and research collaboration from our leading area and product experts including:
&amp;middot; Paul Yates, Security Consultant who is a subject matter expert in the area of cloud security
&amp;middot; James Pyke, Assistant Chief Engineer for Cyber Products
&amp;middot; Steve Mason, Chief Technical Officer, who leads our cyber security innovation research
&amp;middot; A further one Engineer who will support the activities in this work
 
TRL Technology
 
As part of this support, we expect to be contributing advice through regular bilateral meetings with CHARIoT leaders/investigators.
We estimate the total value of this in-kind contribution to be approximately &amp;pound;90,000 in addition to the currently committed value of &amp;pound;100,000.
L-3 TRL expects the results of this research to augment their own defence and commercially positioned work, contributing to the essential analysis required in the fields of IoT and Cloud Security in order to support the projected speed of growth, and adoption of this technology.

Whilst L-3 TRL are still at the very early stages of our own research, I am confident that this proposed partnership would benefit both parties as well as producing significant ground breaking work in this essential field.

Costain Limited is a leading Engineering Solutions provider, operating in Highways, Rail, Water, Oil and Gas, Power and Nuclear Process.
Costain Limited strategically supports Research and Development and our relationship with Warwick University is evident of this commitment. Our relationship with Warwick University is proving to be very productive and dynamic after our recent successes with Innovate UK and our research initiatives; hence Costain is keen to be involved, working closely with Warwick University in their proposal to establish a proposed multidisciplinary Centre for the Internet of Things. As Costain develops as a business, we recognise the importance of data security in a technology economy and having the skills to manage this effectively to protect national infrastructure is significantly important for industry to understand grater and embrace.

Costain would like to pledge its full support to Warwick University and would like to make the following contributions:
&amp;middot; Highways R&amp;amp;D Lead Mohammed Shah to manage the relationship between all parties
&amp;middot; Hosting of meeting at our various offices UK-Wide
&amp;middot; Supplying research data
&amp;middot; Giving access to research facilities or equipment
&amp;middot; Become an external member of an &amp;quot;advisory group&amp;quot; 
&amp;middot; Attend multidisciplinary workshops and &amp;quot;sandpits&amp;quot; run by the Centre around certain themes and challenges
&amp;middot; Hosting secondments of research staff and students from the Centre (short/long term)
&amp;middot; Secondment of staff from the company into the Centre (short/long term)
&amp;middot; Contributing in-kind expertise and advice through regular (e.g. annual) bilateral meetings with Centre investigators/leaders

Due to the close working relationship with Warwick, the importance of this research for our customers and the economy we are investing significantly to support this application. Based on the activities above we see our commitment as a partner to be very active in the Centre. We are pledging &amp;pound;200,000 / year in-kind over the next 3 year which will total of &amp;pound;600,000 over the first phase of the Centres research focus. This commitment is based on a &amp;pound;1bn of our turnover having significant data requirements associated with assets of national importance and the stringent requirements UK Government is placing on this topic.

We look forward to working closely with Warwick University and it's consortium on this very welcomed and timely R&amp;amp;D initiative.

Dear Sirs

CYBERSECURITY AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS HUB

We are writing to express our support for the cyber security and the internet of things hub.

About Pinsent Masons
Pinsent Masons is one of the largest law firms in the UK. We field more than 350 partners and 1500 lawyers with our largest presence in the UK but spread across 20 offices on 3 continents.

We advise clients in the manufacturing sector and have an extensive understanding of these businesses and the industries within which they operate. Our work covers the full range of activities including matters pertinent for present purposes such as data protection, IP, product liability, connectivity, information technology etc.
We would propose to support the consortium project from the UK. 

The importance of the internet of things
The internet of things, the ability of machines to communicate with each other, has profound implications for almost all business sectors including manufacturing. It potentially disrupts traditional business models and supply chains; brings new risks as well as opportunities; and raises a range of legal complexities. These include: how to manage restructuring in response to the disruption to business models; how to protect IP; cyber security; data protection and getting the right contracts in place for new risks, liabilities and relationships.
The internet of things enables manufacturers to gain more data about their operations, customers and markets. This then allows them to make efficiencies through more sophisticated distribution, better supply chains and improved operational effectiveness. These improvements are important to success in a highly competitive world and need to be embraced and managed through effective IT and data management.

With consideration for our own objectives and interest we are very much interested in working with you supporting your research hub as it directly aligns with the issues our clients are facing.
 
There is huge value in bringing together the proposed consortium in one structure to consider these issues. We have a long standing relationship with Warwick and have supported a number of research collaborations and joint seminars and initiatives.

Pinsent Masons Proposed Support to the Project
As well as supporting the project in concept, Pinsent Masons is keen to participate in a practical sense particular in relation to consideration of the data and security issues that may arise. Recognising cyber security as a pressing management issue we have invested already in investigating cyber security with our clients through surveys and assisting clients with cyber readiness and would be keen to bring these 'earnings to the hub.

We would envisage our support would include:- 
- attending any 'advisory group' or workshop sessions to input in respect of early consideration of legal implications;
- inputting into papers addressing legal and policy issues relevant to the project.
Based on the attendance at relevant meetings and the preparation of specific research and discussion papers we would be prepared to contribute senior lawyer time of up to 250 hours over three years at a notional value of up to &amp;pound;90,000.

Yours faithfully

We have weekly meetings with the entire team (CEO and two senior engineers) and we have constant updates in cases of work that affects our experiments.
Grove IS helps develop the Powbal platform. This allows us to schedule the switch-off events for hundreds of plugs, collect the status of each plug and store the data. The platform also calculates the reward points based on the performance of each individual (if they abide by the smart grid choices or not and the power consumed). The company supports the platform, hosts the server on its cloud infrastructure, stores the data for our work and provides support related to the performance of the platform. We also have a two-year Premium support (worth 9,600 GBP) for a 24/7 phone and email support, In version maintenance, feature enhancement support and version upgrade protection (See contract).
Poplar Harca hosts the testbed for SeMIoT experiments, these are the residences that host the plugs we measure. Poplar provides us with access to their facilities, connection with impact champions (energy sensitive individuals to &amp;quot;spread the word&amp;quot; about our work), background information (addresses, names, etc) for the participants, management of the lists and the changes in their premises, etc. They also have organised bi weekly calls with us to provide updates about the progress of the experiments. 
An individual researcher (Alexandros Kosiaris) has helped us to produce the new version of the Powbal platform and contributed to the previous rounds of these experiments. Without his support on a weekly basis this platform would not have become a reality.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research team creates the algorithms the randomly allocate switch off events to the plugs. The team analyzes the responses from the participants and informs them about their performance. The team distributes rewards and monitors the use of the plugs consequently. The research team manages the distribution of the plugs, the resolution of technical faults and the replacement of equipment. The team also reports the results on the dedicated website : www.powbal.net and the PETRAS hub.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute for Sustainability</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>Institute for Sustainability Letter of Support for PETRAS Internet of Things Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>1DFE49E4-3C6A-4BED-AD44-E1954D898FA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Institute for Sustainability have written a letter of support committing their resources to the furtherance of this project.

Re: Callsign support for the EPSRC call &amp;quot;Commitment to Privacy and Trust in Internet of Things Security&amp;quot;.

On behalf of Callsign, I would like to confirm full commitment and support for the establishment of a Research &amp;amp; Development (R&amp;amp;D) hub on privacy and trust in IoT.

Callsign is a rapidly growing start up that is internationally recognised for its game-changing approach to digital identification. Formed in 2011, Callsign has received investment from major tech and professional services firms including Qualcomm, Deutsche Telekom and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Since its inception Callsign has placed major emphasis on continual R&amp;amp;D in the area of computer security, this is reflected in numerous international patents that have been filed and granted.

The company currently employs 38 staff, which is growing on a weekly basis. The majority of staff are software engineers and mathematicians with expertise in the field of computer security and cryptography. Our head office is located in Shoreditch, London with other offices in Palo Alto, California as well as Manhattan and Binghamton, New York. Our commitment to high calibre research is evidenced by the relationships we have formed with State University of New York (SUNY) and the University of Warwick. An annual security hackathon has been created with the Cyber Security Group at the University of Warwick with the inaugural hackathon held in June of 2015; the winning project was focused on preserving security in IoT.

The number of recent high-profile cybersecurity breaches has made securing the Internet of Things a major global priority. Callsign is investing heavily into the R&amp;amp;D of capabilities to help businesses achieve the appropriate levels of security in IoT. Of our R&amp;amp;D spend we will open up &amp;pound;150,000 to your research hub. Based upon this R&amp;amp;D it is anticipated that products will be developed that help businesses improve efficiency, reduce costs and enable improved management of security risks. Ultimately this will have a substantial positive impact on UK Plc. In addition to the direct opportunities and generation of economic wealth, the indirect benefits of the programme are expected to help position the UK as the centre of next generation cybersecurity capability.

Yours Sincerely,
 
Zia Hayat

Re: (proposed) Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things Hub

I am pleased to confirm that Qonex, the consulting arm of Nexor, would be very happy to support your proposal to the above EPSRC funding call.
Nexor provides trustworthy solutions that enable people and enterprises to use technology more productively and securely. We work in industrial sectors as well as national infrastructure, government and defence organisations where the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems is critical. In 2015 we set up Qonex to specifically focus applying Nexor's core expertise in providing trustworthy solutions to the emerging Internet of Things. Our focus is to enable organisations deploying the Internet of Things, understand the cyber security aspects of technology innovation, and to manage the associated risks.

As this Internet of Things market evolves, we welcome collaborating more closely with the research hub to maintain our innovative edge by gaining a much better understanding of these areas as they develop. As an SME we cannot cover all the territory ourselves, and an association with research activities such as this provide us with valuable insight into where to prioritise our efforts.

We anticipate our level of support to include attendance and contribution in workshops, sandpits and seminars as part of information sharing. We estimate our contribution in kind is to a commercial value of &amp;pound;18,000 over the three year period. We would also anticipate working with the university in funded R&amp;amp;D projects to solve specific challenges as they arise.
Yours sincerely

Re: TRL Statement of support for the Centre for Internet of Things
TRL, the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, is an internationally recognised centre of excellence providing world-class research, consultancy and product testing, covering all aspects of transport. TRL was established in 1933 and since that time has continually made significant and lasting contributions to the development of safe, efficient and effective transport systems in the UK and beyond. We currently employ around 375 staff, most of whom are technical specialists in their field, with experts in engineering, statistics, software, psychology and human factors. TRL has access to a range of dedicated facilities including modelling &amp;amp; simulation software, advanced driving simulators, crash test rigs and test tracks. Our head office is in Crowthorne, Berkshire and the company has an annual turnover in excess of &amp;pound;30m. Satellite offices operate in Scotland, Wales, Dubai and Qatar. TRL operates the TRL Academy, an internal body with responsibility for maintaining the academic and research strengths upon which the organisation is founded. The Academy also manages our ongoing engagement with a range of universities and research organisations from the UK and beyond.
We are well aware of the strong capabilities of the core university partners and have a number of research connections. We are, for example, working with Warwick on a &amp;quot;Towards autonomy - Smart and connected control&amp;quot; EPSRC project so are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative.
TRL's business focuses on the generation and application of knowledge in the transport domain. We anticipate that IoT will be a major driver for innovation and development in transport over the next 10 years and will have a huge impact on the safety, efficiency and effectiveness of transport systems of all kinds. It is therefore vital that we understand these developments so that we remain relevant to our markets and customers and are better placed to generate and apply new knowledge in the area. We anticipate that IoT will impact particularly on connected and automated vehicles and on smart cities/smart infrastructure, all of which are important areas of work for us but also areas where the threat of cyber-crime is increasingly high-profile. We also need to understand how these aspects will be handled and will affect our clients and our work.
 
Project Partner Letter of Support
TFL Letter
 
 
 
We intend to engage with and contribute to the Research Hub in a number of ways. Firstly, we would seek to participate as members of the External Advisory Group to help provide direction and governance to the programme. Secondly, we would help to develop the scope for projects undertaken within the Centre's programme based on our knowledge of the domain and future research requirements; this will include participation in workshops, &amp;quot;sandpits&amp;quot; and the like. Thirdly, depending on the scope of the research, we may be able to supply research data or access to specific facilities or equipment. Finally, we would hope to find suitable projects in which we can collaborate (e.g. by contribution of staff effort, secondment of staff to the centre, hosting of centre staff at TRL and co-supervising PhD students).
It is difficult to define the precise financial value of our proposed in-kind support. For budgetary estimation purposes, we suggest maximum values for the four items described over a three year period as follows:
1. Participation in External Advisory Group activities &amp;pound;10k
2. Project scoping and advice &amp;pound;10k
3. Access to data and facilities &amp;pound;30k
4. Project collaboration &amp;pound;60k

In conclusion, we are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative directed by Professor Jeremy Watson of UCL. The Centre for the Internet of Things can develop as a Research Hub of activity in this priority area for the UK and TRL can play an active role in supporting its development and operation. We highly commend this proposal and look forward to joining a first class team.
Yours sincerely

Dear Carsten

Letter of support for the proposed Centre for Internet of Things
Thank you for asking Concentra to participate in this partnership. We would very much like to be considered for this unique opportunity.

What we do
By way of introduction, Concentra helps transform how organisations manage and use their data to get the analytics edge. Our business, analytics and technology experts craft intelligent and intuitive information tools to solve business problems. Whether bespoke solutions or our own products, our tools are game-changing; they give people the power to speed up analysis, drive new insight and hone operations, every day. We are on a mission to find new and better ways for organisations to drive performance and sustain competitive advantage through analytics.

Why we are excited about this opportunity
Concentra is excited to become an active partner of this high profile and important Research Hub. The bringing together of world class, cross disciplinary research leadership combined with a close collaboration with industry represents a unique opportunity to address high value industry needs, from inception, through feasibility study and pilot to commercial adoption. Concentra are today actively marketing products we have developed in Supply Chain, addressing multiple sectors including Health Care, FMCG and Construction, where innovation in building the IoT value chain will deliver huge commercial and societal value. We have in depth understanding of many of the challenges to be faced in exploiting IoT, having made long term investment into innovation for the security and governance of sensitive PII data spanning multiple legal jurisdictions. We have significant expertise in privacy and security best practice including Privacy by Design principles in solution design. We are in active partnership with Warwick University Operations and Supply Chain and the Cyber Security Centre, with whom we have made a joint bid for InnovateUK funding, a partnership which we value highly. It is our belief that the proposed collaboration represents a highly credible partnership to realise the goals of the ComPaTrIoTS Research Hub.

How we can contribute
Our investment in to the project would be on the following basis:

Machine Learning promise radical change in sectors such as medicine, education, elderly care, transport and manufacturing. Like previous revolutions-printing, electricity, the combustion engine, transistors, computers and the internet-AI and Machine Learning will augment and disrupt the world of work. They will turbocharge some jobs and replace others. They will also create new industries that call for workers with skills that do not yet exist. Policymakers must start thinking now about how to realise the potential for AI and Machine Learning to increase economic productivity and to improve the lives of millions-especially people in the developing world. What should they do to encourage the adoption of these technologies? And can they legitimately do so without also responding to their potential negative impact?

The report explored how the UK can create a 'data-enabled' economy through the use of data analytics supported by advanced data connectivity. It examined the opportunities and barriers for organisations and sectors to improve products and services using data analytics, and identified where innovations are possible that can help address the UK's productivity deficit. The sectors explored were advanced manufacturing, built environment, energy, transport, health, aerospace and defence, and insurance.

A key theme emerging from discussions at these workshops was concerns around the integrity and assurance of data, devices and systems in applications such as critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things. In particular, the interconnection of different systems will create systems of systems, either designed or accidental, that are vulnerable to anticipated emergent behaviour, including cascades of failure. One possible source of weakness is the poor quality of software in embedded systems. 

This workshop responds to the first recommendation of Connecting data on 'Strengthening the foundations' (see page 4 of the report). It aims to explore what kind of enabling structure is needed that will ensure safety and resilience, without restricting innovation. Consideration of the need for best engineering practice and systems engineering approaches is a key part of this, as well as incentives to improve the quality of software, hardware and systems. It is also important to understand the cyber-challenge from a socio-technical point of view, with social science playing a key role alongside physical science and engineering in addressing knowledge and capability gaps.

The workshop will bring together representatives from industry, academia, government and infrastructure regulators, with an interest in the safety and resilience of the Internet of Things and critical infrastructure.

Objectives of the workshop:
? To explore the nature of the vulnerabilities created by the interconnection and interdependence of the systems associated with critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things, and identify examples.

? To explore the key objectives and characteristics of an enabling structure, that promotes innovation while ensuring safety and resilience. This would need to apply both to the implementation of new infrastructure and to the phased improvement of legacy systems. 

? To identify possible tools and methodologies for much higher quality in software development. This could include consideration of best engineering practices, and in particular, systems engineering approaches, as well as other rigorous methods built on mathematical foundations. 

To discuss additional mechanisms to incentivise the quality of software, hardware and systems, such as the introduction of enhanced liability in certain situations on producers and importers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c14a63ce9357.00852824</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Alan Turing Institute - High Value Manufacturing Summit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D11AC8B-C085-48B9-92B3-45D88C91AAAC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Carsten Maple gave a talk on securing IoT in the supply chain.

The aim of the conference was to bring together leading academics, law enforcement professionals and representatives from industry and the voluntary sector, on the theme of modern crime prevention. In particular, the focus was on updating prevention in the context of two significant and urgent challenges: firstly, minimising the opportunities that the internet and new technology offer criminals, including organised criminals; and secondly, the need to do more to tackle the victimisation of vulnerable people through crimes that have often been under-reported in the past, such as domestic abuse, child exploitation and slavery. It was intended that the conference, which will be hosted by the Home Secretary, provide a platform to highlight new research, showcase frontline innovation and generate new ideas from a wide range of partners with a stake in protecting the public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c14da9b7b3e1.09499421</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Society Internet of Things Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF918BC9-EF08-428E-9292-4ACD983189BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Jeremy Watson has been invited to Chair a session, alongside Dame Wendy Hall, Jeremy Silver and Patricia Lewis.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c169a63a7da1.89874761</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>US visit with CNRI to discuss details of the Handle system and with the Standford University to discuss the secure IoT research program.

Within STiPS the aim is to explore the particular challenges of developing systems for secure, low-friction, transactions in public spaces. In this workshop we are interested in exploring not only in the exchange of monetary currency, but also in the concept of trading data and personal information, where the line between data and currency blurs, and data becomes currency. As well as the explicit exchanges taking place between people, we are also interested in the trading and transfer of data taking place between devices and systems, of which people are generally unaware, but which forms part of this complex web of data transactions.
 
In the STiPS project so far we have begun to map out the practices and transactions currently taking place in a series of ethnographic studies, and have explored reactions to the BitBarista a hacked coffee machine that sells coffee for Bitcoin. We are looking to move into adopting technology developed at the RBS that may support new data transaction systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a2f53b26d823.97957002</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>6th October 2016 - Microsoft Transform Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>86836CE1-5979-4586-AEDF-4AB1DB09274F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Carsten Maple gave a presentation on the importance of skills and current efforts to provide a suitable work force from higher education and research.

The Design Informatics exhibition, Living with Data, is displayed in a Pavilion produced by Biomorphis architects. It features a range of products and experiences which look to the future: 
In this demo we introduce Bitbarista, a coffee machine that exemplifies a new approach to data access and usage for the design of IoT devices. Bitbarista is connected to the Internet and attempts to communicate complex data processes, gathering consistent information on the state of coffee producing countries. It reveals the social, environmental, qualitative and economic aspects of coffee supply chains affecting end-prices, of which consumers are often unaware. Bitbarista allows people to choose a source of future coffee beans for the machine, and situates their choices within the pool of decisions previously made. In doing so, it places customers within the complexity of factors involved in coffee production, distribution and purchase. The aim is to expose this complexity in order to re-engage users in the market forces that influence and are driven by their choices, providing a positive experience of data display, usage and sharing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a2f1e005cbf5.27582562</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/recentnews/design-informatics-at-the-festival</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Skoll Forum: Trust &amp; Accountability in the Digital Age</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6EB237B6-23D7-48DC-BA36-EA4AAA015B57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a talk entitled: &amp;quot;Responsibilities in the Digital Age&amp;quot; and partecipate in a panel Trust &amp;amp; Accountability in the Digital Age</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c83472c39d81.28497960</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://skoll.org/perspectives/multimedia-gallery/2016-skoll-world-forum/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>APPG on Smart Cities Event: &quot;A Debate on how the Internet of Things can spread its wings&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F9DDC49-C7C1-477C-9BE0-B98F7456B25D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a discussion and networking event which took place at the House of Commons, and the Chair of the session was Mark Prisk MP.

We are investigating a technology which involved secure identifier management systems to describe the deployment, the data produce and protocols for access. The resultant database that be utilize in the IoT implementation and subsequent operation.

It is realize that one of the key barriers to the acceptability of IoT applications is the need to ensure security and privacy. Similar concerns will apply as to whether different IoT applications will be permitted to use the same deployment of assets.

We are investigating a generic approach to resolving this problem by the use of a secure identifier management system, We will use an existing open source system called Handle. This is nearly to allow rapid progress in tackling the problem. Handle seems to provide the sort of security, distribution and large scale capability to meet most of our requirements.At in an early stage we will explore to what extend the facilities such as security, maintenance and extension in the IoT domain.

While both of problem and the approach are generic, it is important to applied them in an specific application domain which is both important and tractable. One such domain is that of the building information model (BIM) which has been mandated by the UK government for our future procurement from central fundings. 

A current level 2 of that standard foul of the needs of IoT and security. We are making contributions to the migration of that technology towards BIM Level 3, which is targeted to solved this problems completely.

One of the main technologies to represent building models is IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). The present state,named IFC4 can help automate building design and construction, but it not rich enough to include IoT and security. 

To achieve our goal, our work is based in two different contributions:IFC+ and the use of Handle System as support for digital objects.

The extension of IFC4 have to had detail descriptions of the attributes required for networks, security and data description. Handle System is a Secure Identifier Management System open available resolve, store and manage system which is globally accessible and widely used in other domain areas. It already contains hundreds of millions of entities in large number of servers. It provides a complete infrastructure for the prevision of types of encryption techniques to ensure the authentication and protection of the digital objects.

In addition, the use of Handle permits access control of what entities can perform operations on the deployment database we show in some sample instances how to transform the file based IFC into the sort of database suitable for secure operations with Handle. It is this form of database which is then used for secure IoT applications.

Because data and procedures can be incorporated into the Handle system database and in its integrated fashion, this technology can be used also to describe how the data is transmitted and can be accessed. This goes considerably beyond the current achievements of BIM Level 2.

The use of both technologies, IFC+ and Handle System, allow to deploy IoT scenarios (Smart buildings) ready to be used by multi stakeholder IoT applications, assuring the privacy and security aspects.

This specific Handle implementation includes a number of facilities to improve performances and resilience, we will investigate to what extend this relevant in this application domain.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BCA567E3-4870-434A-AA00-8706A54A43BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We dont yet have any notable impact result.
