In particular, it focuses on the role of the imagination in shaping and informing understandings of the judge and judging. It contends that our understandings and interpretations of the judge are as much derived from the imagination as they are from what is conventionally considered to be rational thought. To this end, the project deploys literary examples and techniques as a means of identifying and disrupting the imaginative hold of particular images and narratives of the judge and judging. \n\nCentral to this are current debates about gender representation in the judiciary. Throughout the western world the slowly gathering experience of women judges in hitherto male-dominated legal systems is provoking extensive commentary about the extent to which women judges can or should make a difference to the style and substance of legal decision-making. This focus on judicial difference brings into sharp relief the extent to which prevailing images of the judge are enmeshed in notions of sameness and uniformity. Images which are, at one and the same time, so familiar and two-dimensional as to belie their unacknowledged grip on our imaginative and cognitive processes. \n\nSo understood, the project seeks to highlight the extent to which current Governmental initiatives seeking to ensure judicial diversity in England and Wales, and in particular their focus on diversity, fail to confront fully these instinctive images of the judge and judging. As a result, their narrative of inclusiveness and difference fails. To date, much of the literature (both academic and official) has tended to focus on arguments for increasing judicial diversity or the position of various underrepresented groups within the judiciary. In contrast, this project utilises the methodologies of feminist legal theory and law and literature and appeals to the imagination as a route toward engendering new conceptions on the judge and judging and thereby the possibility of a truly diverse judiciary. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16689</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G002975/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB13D4DA-F283-46AB-8BD6-B86DAEB82726</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Jurisprudence/Legal Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
