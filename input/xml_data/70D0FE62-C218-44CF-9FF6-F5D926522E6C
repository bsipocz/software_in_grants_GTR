architecture and functional annotation of protein families</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/K004131/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The list of organisms with completed genome sequence is continuously growing and this has led to the identification of thousands of genes whose function is still unknown. These genes could potentially be involved in important biological cell functions and could represent important targets for diagnostic and pharmacogenomics studies and be of industrial and agronomical importance. A major undertaking for biology is therefore that of identifying the function of these uncharacterized genes on a genomic scale. The challenge for bioinformatics is then to develop algorithms that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function.

Comparisons of sequences from complete genomes have revealed that gene duplication, divergence and rearrangement are predominant mechanisms that drive the expansion of the set of proteins of a given organism during evolution. This means that proteins can be grouped into families, where members are likely to perform similar functions. The identification of these protein families is therefore central as it can provide important clues for the function of proteins.

Proteins are often composed of several domains. A domain is segment of protein sequence that can evolve independently of the rest of the protein chain. Each domain forms a compact three-dimensional structure and it can appear in a variety of different proteins. Protein function depends on the mutual interplay between the distinct domains and the links between them. In other words, protein function depends on the domain architecture of the protein.

Therefore we would like to have a tool that can group proteins into families according to their architecture: all proteins with the same architecture should belong to the same group. The development of such a tool is exactly the goal of this project. Moreover the tool that we plan here will also be able to suggest possible functional roles for the various architectures.

Our tool is aimed at working on very large sets of proteins. The amount of calculations for problems of this size is only feasible by taking advantage of the latest advances in graphical processing unit (GPU) technology. Modern GPUs are very efficient for graphics but their highly parallel structure makes them extremely effective for algorithms where processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel - even more effective than general-purpose CPUs. 
The use of GPU technology will allow us to create a web application that will be used by scientists to obtain the architectures for very large set of proteins together with possible functional roles for the various architectures. Importantly, we shall periodically run our system on the major genomes available and we will thus be able to through our web server architectures and relative annotation for all the proteins in those genomes. All these web services will be made freely available to the scientific community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Proteins can be grouped into families, where members are likely to perform similar functions. The identification of these protein families is important as it can provide important clues for the function of proteins. Proteins are often composed of more than one domain (basic structural or functional units of evolution) and protein function depends on the mutual interplay between the distinct domains and the links between them. In other words, protein function depends on the domain architecture of the protein.

The preliminary work for this project is constituted by GFam, a system that we have recently developed which is able to group proteins into families where proteins share common domain architecture. GFam has been applied to sets of about 30k proteins.

The current proposal is aimed at creating tools for providing consensus signature architectures for very large sequence datasets. To do this we shall develop a new high performance implementation of the GFam pipeline. This will run in parallel on multiple processors servers and multiple GPGPUs.
Moreover we shall develop a web application that will provide a display of the architectures through a user-friendly web interface. The interface will allow users to to retrieve proteins with the same architecture in either the same or in different organisms. Importantly will also provide sets of functional annotation terms associated with each of the different consensus signature architectures. 
The system will be run periodically on all complete genome projects and will provide protein families architectures and their functional annotation for all the proteins in those genomes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit biologists interested in protein function, both experimental and computational scientists from academia and industry. The results will impact any biologist interested in understanding how organisms and life processes arise through natural selection mechanisms acting on the protein repertoire encoded by the genome of the organism. 

Our method will make a serious impact towards understanding the large proportion of uncharacterized genes and proteins as genome sequencing efforts have left us with near-complete knowledge of hundreds of full genomic sequences, but without a comparably exhaustive inventory of what all these genes and proteins do; in many cases we have no clues to the function of these genes. This is critical as obtaining even some clue on the function of the 40% of functionally uncharacterized proteins in model organism genomes can have significant impact in a broad variety of areas e.g. drug, antibody and vaccine design, agronomic trait improvement, biochemical engineering, protein design and even nanotechnology. 

The key impact of our research is that our web portal seeks to serve as a one-stop source on proteins, their organization in the form of domains and their myriad biological, biochemical and cellular functions under one umbrella. Given that our web portal will be an integrated resource, it has the potential to be a great teaching resource for under-graduate and graduate course in genome biology, protein science and evolutionary biology. 

Since this project aims to use the latest computing advancements in hardware technology through the use of Graphics Processor Units, the staff working on this project will take with them transferable skills that are much sought after in academia and industry. For staff interested in continuing in academia, the dissemination of the research through peer-reviewed journal articles will help attain their career goals in the form of faculty or postdoc positions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114627</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cornell University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cancer genomics -- Haiyuan Yu (Cornell University)</gtr:description><gtr:id>E441FDC2-A454-4B61-A916-208089A4F86E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A journal paper describing the method is currently under review in BMC Biology.

Paraguay is one of the largest producers of soya in the world, this work has important economic implications for the country.

2) Matteo Pellegrini (University of California, Los Angeles) leads a lab with a high interest in algal genomics. The lab is currently sequencing the genome of the unicellular alga Cyclotella cryptica, a model organism for lipid accumulation. This work has application in the biofuel production industry. The Pellegrini lab has been using the functional predictions provided by ConSAT to annotate this algal genome.

In our group, we have used ConSAT to participate in the second CAFA challenge, a competition of protein function prediction. Although this activity is within the academic domain, we think it has been important for acquiring visibility and engaging further collaborations.

Finally GoSSToWeb (our web tool for computing semantic similarities between gene products), although it was published very recently (August 2014), has been used numerous times by more than 50 different researchers. We have also received more than ten communications from different users (mainly life scientists) showing interest in the tool and asking different queries regarding its usage.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>223C4731-A89E-409E-A235-AF21869CF3A1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54626f70ac6ff4.98680930</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>With the advent of faster and cheaper sequencing technologies the availability of genomic sequences has grown in an exponential manner. Knowing the sequences of an organism is a necessary step for their understanding at a molecular level: certain sequences may represent important targets for diagnostic and pharmacogenomics studies and be of industrial and agronomical importance. However, the process of obtaining these genetic sequences needs to be followed by the understanding of the role (function) played by each one of these genes or their corresponding proteins. A fundamental goal is therefore to identify the function of uncharacterized genes on a genomic scale. It is difficult to design functional assays for uncharacterized genes so a major current challenge in bioinformatics is to devise algorithmic methods that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function that can then be validated experimentally.

Comparisons of sequences from complete genomes have revealed that gene duplication, divergence and rearrangement are predominant mechanisms that drive the expansion of the set of proteins of a given organism during evolution. This means that proteins can be grouped into families, where members are likely to perform similar functions. The identification of these protein families is therefore central as it can provide important clues for the function of proteins. Besides, proteins are often composed of several domains. A domain is a segment of protein sequence that can evolve independently of the rest of the protein chain. Each domain forms a compact three-dimensional structure and it can appear in a variety of different proteins. Protein function depends on the mutual interplay between the distinct domains and the links between them (the domain architecture of the protein).

We have produced a computational method that can group proteins into families according to their architecture. All proteins with the same architecture belong to the same group and therefore this can be used to assign them properties (functions) within that group. We provide two types of functional descriptions: (a) Gene Ontology terms (functions from a controlled vocabulary of biological functions which is a de facto standard in biology); (b) English words with an associated numerical score (weight), describing the protein in plain English terms. Moreover:

1) we have built a tool (ConSAT) aimed at working on very large sets of proteins (i.e. whole genomes) and produce functional assignments for each sequence. This tool is written in Python and it is available at https://github.com/alfonsoeromero/ConSAT with an free software licence (GPLv3), which means that anyone is free to download, modify and use it for any purpose. 

2) we have precomputed a functional assignment for all UniProtKB proteins (all the publicly available protein sequences) and we have displayed our prediction on the ConSAT webserver http://paccanarolab.org/consat. On the website the user can query, browse and download the predictions for any given protein or set of proteins. The website is freely available for any user at no charge.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>ConSAT is of high interest to researchers focusing on protein domain architectures and functional genomics. To name a few, potential beneficiaries of this project are:

1. The biological community at large, interested in comprehensive annotation of genomes.

2. Genome database annotators involved in curating model organism resources like Flybase (Drosophila), Wormbase (round worm), ZFIN (zebra fish), MGI (mouse), TAIR (Arabidopsis) etc.

3. Agriculture: predicting function for plant genes should enable to design genetic methods to improve plant performance.

4. Structural genomics projects that try to understand 3D structure and function of domains with only sequence information.

5. Genome researchers interested in comparative genomic tools and applications for understanding how organisms evolve and species radiate.

6. Researchers interested in designing molecular switches through domain engineering strategies. 

7. Pharmaceutical companies looking to attack species-specific pathways containing a certain protein domain architecture.

8. New sequencing efforts: this method could enable researchers to rapidly assign putative function to new genes in freshly sequenced organisms. 

So far we are aware of our work being used by researchers of the second group (Rajkumar Sasidharan, at TAIR), third group (Pablo Sotelo, Asuncion) and the eighth group (Matteo Pellegrini, UCLA).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B8BE8668-C478-4BE1-94D6-A516E7051A9D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462372f89bd07.38419995</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.paccanarolab.org/consat</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We introduce a MeSH-based method that accurately quantifies similarity between heritable diseases at molecular level.

We applied some of these methods within a collaboration project with the labs of Andrew Emili (University of Toronto) and Edward Marcotte (Universty of Texas, Austin) which was aimed at detecting human protein complexes.

In particular, for this project we deployed: ClusterONE, our algorithm for detecting overlapping protein complexes from PPI networks; GOSSTO, our method for calculating semantic similarities on the Gene Ontology; an information diffusion method we developed for denoising protein interaction data. 

The protein interaction networks identified experimentally in Emili's lab were enriched with networks generated using comparative genomics approaches in Marcotte's lab. Then, in my lab, we integrated this network with a semantic similarity graph (obtained using GOSSTO), applied our denoising procedure, and finally clustered the resulting graph using ClusterONE.

We thus obtained the largest catalogue to date of human protein complexes from cell culture.

The human protein complexes repository contains all the data generated in this study in an easily navigable format. These include all the pairwise protein interactions obtained through integration of the experimental data with public genomic evidence and the subunit composition of the 622 putative protein complexes obtained by clustering using ClusterONE.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3A8D9814-7FBB-4915-A1F1-CA6439EB2E4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The original publication where this dataset was first release has been cited, to date, more than 100 times (Google Scholar).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546232237acc71.13351944</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SolubleComplexes</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://human.med.utoronto.ca/php/data_download.php</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>S2F (Sequence to Function) is a software package implementing our diffusion-based method for predicting protein function in organisms for which little or no experimental data is available and the only available information is the set of protein sequences.
