The main focus of the project is the development of image analysis methods to process the large CT volumes. I want to exploit the correlation between time-ordered samples to improve the reliability and robustness of extracting root material and to gain knowledge about temporal changes at the soil and root interface, and thus to learn more about root responses to environmental signals. By using information across samples, I hope to detect roots that are generally difficult to see and thus to overcome many of the current limitations. The main objectives of the proposed research are to:

1) Exploit time-series to use the coherence in information across time-ordered samples in the recovery of root systems from X-ray CT image data, and to quantify dynamic root growth parameters of soil grown plants.

2) Extract key features in X-ray CT image data of the soil matrix to identify both small- and large-scale movements over time, and relate how soil structure influences root growth and development.

3) Use time-series data to resolve ambiguities in root labelling of multiple and interacting plants, and define dynamic and interactive traits to describe resource competition among neighbouring plants.

The project is tied to a biological experiment, in which I will use developed methods to look at the root system interactions between winter wheat and black-grass. In preliminary experiments the wheat variety Edgar has shown enhanced tolerance to black-grass as compared to other winter wheat varieties. I will use developed image analysis methods to assess the impact of planting density on root system development of wheat. In addition I will use developed techniques to sample data of winter wheat in disturbed and undisturbed soils, to examine the effects of soil structure on the development of root systems and the overall plant.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Using X-ray micro computed tomography, I aim at developing computational methods that allow the recovery of information on soil-root and root-root interactions from time series data, looking at root growth patterns and soil deformation over time.

The new software tools will be applied in the first instance to investigate root growth under disturbed and undisturbed soils and the interactions of multiple root systems in soil to study a) the inhibitory effects on black-grass and b) the planting density effects on wheat. However through making the tools free to all they will be applicable to address research priorities in a range of areas in the plant and soil sciences. The computational methods and biological analysis in this project both have impacts with a wide reach across the academic community and into commercially applicable science. Opportunities are provided to communicate research to the general public and in particular engage school children with science.

The most immediate beneficiaries are academic groups with interest in the development and growth of plant roots and their responses to the environment. As with previous tools I have generated in this area, all the software resulting from this project will be released under an open-source licence via GitHub. The impact can be measured by the number of downloads of the software and citations of the corresponding paper.
- plant and crop scientists are likely to use the software tools provided to examine a wide range of plant-plant interactions (e.g. in inter-cropping), to map their development over time.
- plant and soil scientists will use the tools to investigate soil-root interactions, making the full value of X-ray CT technology available to the rapidly expanding research community at a time when X-ray technology is both improving in quality and reducing in price.
There is increasing interest in the wider computer vision community in the methods being developed for plant image analysis (see CVPPP 2014 and 2015). The computational methods developed are expected to be applicable to X-ray CT data obtained in other e.g. medical domains, and may be extended to other 3D imaging modalities.

This project is not expected to have specific patentable outcomes. Rather its impact for commercial beneficiaries will be the knowledge and the tools that are developed. The project directly addresses the concerns of the agriculture. I regular communicate key findings to the private sector through meetings sponsored and attended by representatives of the agricultural industry, e.g. BASF Top Science International Symposium - Unlocking Yield Potential in Soil (2014). The University's Hounsfield Facility has strong interactions with industrial partners, undertaking specific projects, to which I will advise and promote developed tools. The impact will be measured through successful case studies emerging through collaborations with companies.
 
Press releases are routinely prepared together with the media office at the University of Nottingham to raise the profile of high impact papers, which are often picked up by local and national media. I intend to continue this activity and will apply to attend the Media Training course run by the BBSRC, which will be free of charge to supported fellows. I will write a science based blog, to increase the transparency of my research throughout the project. Impact will be measured by the number of visits to the blog. 
I regular engage in public outreach events (e.g. Science in the Park (2015, 2016)) to communicate research in a way that attendees are able to understand, and I frequently run educational activities with school children (e.g. Woodthorpe Infant School (2015), Nottingham Schools Science Fair (2014), Firbeck Primary School (2014, 2016)) to promote interest in science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243805</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DCED2432-55C1-423C-9CA4-909C84BACFEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shaping 3D Root System Architecture.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current biology : CB</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a9b9c87b0bc511b71ba865da0f5ad2ff"><gtr:id>a9b9c87b0bc511b71ba865da0f5ad2ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morris EC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-9822</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa536d188bab4.23938319</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P011446/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>15080F45-1EA3-41B4-BC23-C49CB918FBC4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE2D53CC-F199-452E-A1FE-B63F4222D636</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>96F70ACB-D35F-416F-9360-4EFD402DFA6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Soil science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
