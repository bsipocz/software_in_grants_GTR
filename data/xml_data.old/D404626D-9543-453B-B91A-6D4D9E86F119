Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J022276/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The resolution of individual employment disputes has become a crucial issue for policy-makers and practitioners in the UK. Accordingly, this seminar series brings together, for the first time, the leading centres of academic research in this area to provide a forum in which cutting-edge research from both the UK and the USA will be presented and explored.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The series will develop new conceptual approaches to the understanding the nature of individual workplace conflict and the pattern of individual employment disputes. It will also examine the way in which organisations manage conflict and how this is shaped by HR strategies and structures of employee representation. Furthermore, the potential of alternative dispute resolution processes such as mediation will be assessed. In this way the seminar series will provide key insights into ongoing policy debates over the legal regulation of employment and workplace dispute resolution, define a future research agenda and lay the foundations for the development of increased research capacity.&lt;br />&lt;br />The series, which is sponsored by Acas, CMP Resolutions, Consensio Partners, and TCM Group will also draw on the experiences of leading practitioners and policy-makers to share knowledge and identify innovative approaches to conflict management and resolution.&lt;br />Overall Programme&lt;/p>

Similarly, the costs of individual employment disputes and their associated negative impact on organisational performance are a central concern for employers in both the private and public sectors. Furthermore, the consequences of legislative reform for fairness, equity and diversity within UK workplaces is a particular concern for trade unions and the TUC. This seminar series will deepen understanding of workplace dispute resolution and provide the basis for more effective policy and practice. Its relevance for key users is clearly illustrated by the attached correspondence from Dept of BIS, Acas, CIPD, BCC, CBI, TUC, CMP Resolutions, Consensio Partners, and TCM Group. 

The seminar series will assist Acas in three main ways. Firstly, it will provide insights in respect of policy for which Acas has a key responsibility in advising government. Secondly, it will inform the provision of advice services to employers and employees. Thirdly, it will help Acas to maximise the effectiveness of training in dispute resolution and mediation. For BIS, the seminar series will explore the implications of current proposals under the government dispute resolution consultation and employment law review. In particular it will provide vital evidence in respect of the potential of workplace mediation, a question posed within the current consultations. At a broader level it will provide a substantial evidence base on which future policy deliberations can be based and identify possible innovations in this area. This will also be of significant interest to legal practitioners.

The research presented during the seminar series will inform the advice that organisations such as the CBI, CIPD, BCC and the FSB provide to their members. It will shape their attitudes to public policy and also assist them in making representations to government. The series will provide evidence as to the roles played by HR professionals and managers within dispute resolution and so will assist the development of more effective practice. It will extend the evidence base in respect of areas identified as priorities by the CIPD such as workplace mediation. Moreover, seminar four will explicitly examine the role of employee voice and employee representation. This will help the TUC, trade unions and organisations such as Citizens Advice to develop effective policy but will also provide vital data regarding the roles played by representatives and hence help to improve the training of representatives in disciplinary and grievance matters. 

Given the policy relevance of the seminar series, it will be firmly grounded within the user community. Leading figures within Dept. of BIS, Acas, CIPD, CBI, TUC, BCC and a number of private mediation providers (CMP Resolution TCM Group and Consensio Partners) have agreed to participate within and contribute to the seminar series. Each seminar will therefore provide opportunites for users to share their experiences with each other and leading academic researchers. Furthermore the final seminar will bring together academics, HR professionals, managers, trade union representatives and policy makers to discuss the issues raised by the series. 

We will also seek to disseminate the lessons learnt from the seminar series throughout the wider user community. A report outlining the policy implications of our research will be published and we will seek to disseminate key research from the series within practitioner journals such as People Management and Personnel Today, as well as presenting findings at practitioner conferences such as the CIPD Annual Conference. Finally, we will broaden the impact of the findings through the seminar series' web-pages that will become a key resource for practitioners with an interest in dispute resolution.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17832</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Plymouth</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>US/UK Conflict Management in Corporations</gtr:description><gtr:id>19B94399-6F98-4B53-855E-9F706D603BA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54634612785707.65062484-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners led by David Lipskey (Cornell) will be providing expert advice and guidance in the design and conduct of the survey.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration is designed to conduct research (survey) into the conflict management practices of FTSE500 companies in the UK, replicating in part a previous study into FORTUNE1000 companies in the USA.

Acas's Director of Strategy has commented that the series 'has been an extremely powerful tool in unpacking the core issues associated with conflict management (embracing legal, practitioner, policy dimensions, and international comparisons) and importantly in raising the profile of this debate'. 
Ed Sweeney, then Chair of Acas and Richard Saundry (PI) published an invited article entitled, &amp;quot;Is it time to see conflict management as a strategic issue?&amp;quot; in leading practitioner HR journal, Personnel Today, in October 2013. This was based on their contributions to the final seminar held at Westminster. 
[http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/01/10/2013/59680/is-it-time-to-see-conflict-management-as-a-strategic-issue.htm]. 
Importantly, the series played an important role in the formulation of Acas strategy in relation to the early resolution of disputes at work and the active management of conflict. Acas have also used the findings from the series to inform the development of advice and training in relation to workplace mediation. For example, Acas and CIPD launched &amp;quot;Mediation: An approach to resolving workplace issues&amp;quot; to coincide with the Swansea seminar which focussed on mediation (http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/m/f/Mediation-an-approach-to-resolving-workplace-issues.pdf)
Acas commissioned and published a discussion paper, 'Managing Conflict and Resolving Individual Employment Disputes in the Contemporary Workplace' authored by the seminar organisers, which provided an overview of the key findings from the series (http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/6/9/reframing_policy_paper_FINAL.pdf.)
Research presented during the series also featured in a speech made by Acas Chair, Sir Brendan Barber to the Wales TUC in June 2014 - highlighting the need to support and develop managerial skills in conflict resolution. This coincided with the publication of an Acas Comment Paper 'Plugging the confidence gap? Changing perceptions of conflict at work' which featured research from the series. (http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/0/1/ER-Comment-conflict-at-work.pdf)
Key findings from the series were summarised by research organisers in a series of papers which have been published on the ESRC ROS. This, together with other materials from the seminars, has produced a resource which is already informing policy, practice and teaching. For example, materials have been used by researchers from Employment Research Australia who were compiling a major report for the Australian Fair Work Commission into the use of mediation in bullying and harassment cases. Similarly, these resources informed work being conducted by the United Nations into the development of their own staff conflict resolution practices. Furthermore, the series has strengthened links between practitioners in the UK and academic researchers. For example, seminar organisers have been asked by the CIPD to provide design and analysis advice on new CIPD workplace conflict research. Following the conclusion of the series, two contributors to the series were commissioned by the CIPD to revise their core Employee Relations text - 'Managing Employment Relations'. For the first time, this will include chapters on conflict management and workplace mediation - the fact that this book is a core text on the CIPD's professional syllabus extends the reach of the work developed during the seminar series.
Across the 6 seminars approximately 200 practitioners either attended or requested materials related to the series. This has resulted in the establishment of informal networks which have the potential to underpin future collaborative research and maximise impact. One example of this was links forged between academics involved in the series and staff from 'Skills for Justice' who were involved in a feasibility study for the establishment of a Centre for Mediation on behalf of the Welsh Government. Their final report which argued the case for a dispute resolution 'hub' cites heavily from the seminars and subsequent outputs (http://www.sfjuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mediation-Phase-1-Report-January-2014.pdf).
Moreover, feedback from practitioner delegates suggests that their involvement in the series has led them to change or review their approach to conflict management, presented examples of best practice and provided opportunities for reflection upon their existing behaviours.
The series has provided the basis for improved research collaboration. Two successful bids for funding for 'Acas Research Partnerships' have been concluded which developed from new contacts made between academics and also between academics and practitioners. Cross-national partnerships have been formed to extend research themes developed in USA to the UK context. In addition, the seminar held in Queen's University Belfast, led to the Labour Relations Commission in Ireland commissioning two of the researchers involved in the series to complete a study of Innovative Workplace Conflict Management in Ireland. The research award was ?60,000.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B7CF04EB-E401-478E-B139-0310A845A2FC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54468c6a5ddf36.56054040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series brought together, for the first time in the UK, academics, policy makers and practitioners to explore workplace dispute resolution and conflict management. It consisted of six seminars held at the Universities of Strathclyde, Central Lancashire, Swansea, Queens Belfast, Warwick and Westminster. The series was sponsored by Acas and mediation providers, CMP Resolutions, Consensio Partners and the TCM Group, involved contributions from a range of employers, HR practitioners, trade union officials, employer representatives and policymakers including BIS, CBI TUC, CIPD, FSB, UNISON, EEF and IPA.
The series has extended the evidence base through the presentation of new academic research and the generation of key insights from practitioners and policymakers. Consequently, a number of critical issues and themes were identified:
 i) The emergence of a 'resolution gap' in many organisations caused by the erosion of structures of employee voice and the changing functions of HR practitioners;
 ii) The growing involvement of line management in conflict management often without well designed training and organizational support systems. In addition, senior managers lack confidence in the ability or competence of line managers to handle workplace conflict effectively;
 iii) The critical importance of locating conflict resolution at the heart of organisational strategy;
 iv) The potential of workplace mediation to transform the culture of conflict management and the barriers to its adoption;
 v) The need to develop more integrated approaches to the management of conflict.
These findings were set out in a discussion paper specially commissioned by Acas and written by the organisers of the series, 'Reframing Resolution - Managing Conflict and Resolving Individual Employment Disputes in the Contemporary Workplace, Acas Policy Discussion Papers'. http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/6/9/reframing_policy_paper_FINAL.pdf.
Moreover, they will be explored in greater detail in a forthcoming edited volume, 'Reframing Resolution - Innovation and Change in the Management of Workplace Conflict' to be published by Palgrave McMillan in 2016.
The series produced a range of outputs which were made available through the ESRC and also dedicated UCLAN webpages. hosted by UCLAN. These include presentation slides, videos and analytical summaries of each seminar. They form a unique resource which has been accessed and utilised by a range of practitioners, policy researchers and academics.
The series attracted approximately 300 participants and deepened on-going partnerships between researchers, practitioners and policymakers. New networks were created creating the basis for sustainable research capacity in this field. PhD students received travel bursaries to allow them to attend seminars, make poster presentations and develop valuable contacts with established researchers. A seminar featuring the work of these PhD students is planned for 2015. In addition, new links were formed between researchers based in the UK and the USA. This has led to the development of a unique research project extending research into the conflict management practices of Fortune1000 companies in the USA to FTSE500 companies in the UK. In addition, new project teams were formed to conduct Acas funded research into WERS2011 during 2014 and to collaborate over developing the themes from the seminars into potential large-scale bids for further funding.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from the series will be further developed and disseminated through the publication of an edited collection to be published by Palgrave McMillan in 2016. Papers presented through the series have been developed into academic journal articles and a proposal for a special issue of the Industrial Relations Journal has also been submitted. 
The series has provided the basis for further research. It has helped to establish conflict management as a key issue for Acas which underpins its strategic aim to 'resolve disputes at work at the earliest stage and help avoid conflict in the future'. Researchers have received further funding from Acas and the Labour Relations Commission to deepen their enquiry into key themes identified during the series. The series has informed the development of conflict resolution practice both in the UK and overseas. Materials were used by researchers compiling a major report for the Australian Fair Work Commission into the use of mediation in bullying and harassment cases and series findings also informed work conducted by the United Nations into their internal conflict management strategies.
Findings from the series will also be taken forward by early career researchers. A symposium for the PhD students who participated in the seminar series will be held at the University of Sheffield in 2015. This will enable new researchers an opportunity to present their work in more detail, and further develop collaborative networks.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C3DB2DA3-D8CC-4404-8186-80F7BA539912</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544689461cf1c1.89933546</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/groups/institute_research_organisations_work_employment_irowe.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Acas - Conflict Management</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>74D7642A-800F-4E7B-BE79-F47AD05DA3F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Acas Annual Report for 2013/14 states that 'the series, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, brought together international academics, policy makers and practitioners to debate conflict handling strategies.
