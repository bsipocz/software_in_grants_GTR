It can also be comic, romantic, comfortable, even comforting. This project argues that both media and academy have hitherto overlooked a powerful counter-narrative within contemporary Gothic - one defined in terms of celebration rather than exhaustion. Contextualising Gothic texts and artefacts amidst the politics and shifting sensibilities of Goth subculture following the Columbine Massacre and Sophie Lancaster's murder, the project explores what is at stake in the suppression of this comic, celebratory narrative and its implications for the way Anglophone cultures deal with subcultural difference.\n\nThe project develops a new argument within the field of Gothic Studies, demonstrating that the apparently diverse, ephemeral and 'trivial' manifestations of Gothic in the twenty-first century contribute to a coherent cultural narrative that has hitherto been overlooked or misunderstood. It seeks to understand this by placing it in specific cultural contexts, relating to the shifts in the way Goth subculture has been positioned in the Anglophone media over the last decade. \n\nContemporary Gothic is conventionally perceived by the media in terms of moral panic: the ultra-violence of video games, for example; the misogyny of 'torture porn' films like Hostel and Saw; the pernicious influences of metal bands. Concomitantly, an academic industry has grown up implicitly reinstating the moral value and social purpose of the Gothic as a medium uniquely suited to exploring cultural trauma and/or anxiety (examples are too numerous to list here, but include Arata 1996, Goddu 1997, Blake 2008). With a different yet related focus, Botting (2008) argues that we are now at the limits of horror, forced to repeatedly view atrocities to the point of banality, and teetering on the brink of a cultural void. The racking up of horror upon horror is, however, only one side of the story. This project argues that the preferred critical narratives of moral panic, trauma and anxiety in relation to Gothic have been privileged in both the media and academia: moral panics sell newspapers; 'serious' issues shore up the cultural prestige of an embattled humanities. Nevertheless, it is striking how manifestations of Gothic in contemporary literature and culture are frequently concerned with pleasure rather than horror, visual aesthetics and performativity rather than 'authentic' trauma, from Heston's Gothic Feast on Channel 4 to Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd. \n\nThis project seeks to draw together these diverse phenomena under the label of 'Happy Gothic': a mode that embraces the trappings of gloom with a light heart. 'Happy Gothic' draws on the genres of comedy, fantasy and romance. This project will argue that Happy Gothic is both a response to the perceived cultural exhaustion of Gothic (Jameson 1991, Botting 2008) and inextricably bound up with the increased media visibility and consequent shifts in self-definition of Goth subculture since the 1999 Columbine Massacre. For example: the resurgence of 'Gothic chic' circa 2007-9 is juxtaposed with media accounts of the murder of self-identified Goth Sophie Lancaster in Bacup, Lancashire in 2007; the preoccupation with assimilation in recent vampire novels by Stephenie Meyer and Charlaine Harris is read in terms of the Goth response to media reporting of Columbine; and the practice of tourism in Whitby is understood as fuelled by the twin drives of commodified heritage and subcultural carnival, embodied in the biannual 'Goth Weekend'. Exploring these phenomena is of crucial importance not only in understanding how this highly visible, global subculture is characteristically narrated in twenty-first century media, but also in interrogating the hierarchies of 'value' ascribed to different forms of cultural production, and investigating the complex relationship between entertainment and fear in twenty-first culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Contemporary Gothic film, fiction, fashion and television have an enormous international fan-base and make a substantial, if unmeasured, contribution to the British cultural economy. However, their very popularity often leads to them being overlooked in academic funding competitions. Post-Millennial Gothic will investigate the place of Gothic in the contemporary marketplace and as such will be valuable to those working in commercial fields such as advertising (I have twice been contacted by the advertising industry on the strength of my previous book Contemporary Gothic). It will also appeal to those non-academic fans mentioned above, including members of the highly literate Goth subculture which the book discusses. My last monograph, Contemporary Gothic (2006), has sold over 1500 copies to date, and has been translated into Korean, demonstrating the subject's ability to reach beyond a strictly academic audience.\n\nI also intend to use my research to make a more measurable cultural and economic impact by working with local arts organisations Litfest and The Dukes. I will be using knowledge gained during the research to advise Litfest on producing a one-day literary festival on the contemporary Gothic. The aim is to create a unique and innovative event that enables conversations between so-called 'literary' and 'genre' writers as well as broadening Litfest's reach to new audiences. A session on young adult fiction will be targeted specifically at local schools. This will, if successful, become an annual event. With the Dukes, I will co-ordinate and introduce a series of film screenings, again related to my research in twenty-first century Gothic. These events are intended to enrich the cultural life of the local community as well as to attract a select audience from further afield, stimulating economic activity in the area. \n\nI have a strong commitment to knowledge transfer and have previously given public lectures in Litfest's Lunchtime Classics series and on contemporary vampire cinema at the Dukes. Both of these were highly successful and led to sharing information with local schools. Gothic is now part of the A-level English Literature syllabus and I regularly give talks to sixth-formers both in my own local area and more widely. I have been particularly proud of the work I have done with students at Cornwall College Camborne (a link formed from connections made at a previous academic post in Cornwall), which characteristically educates students with low educational expectations from a deprived rural area. Discussing contemporary texts popular with young adults such as the Twilight series or Tim Burton's films enables a way in to more 'classic' texts for students, particularly those who may be struggling with the syllabus, and also helps empower them to articulate their own interests and concerns, as well as potentially nurturing aspirations to higher education. I plan to return to Cornwall College for further visits as part of my knowledge transfer commitment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62671</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'An Extravagant Degree of Love': The Trouble with Sparkly Vampires</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C9A7A82-E01A-4547-84E0-A05C31614D39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk on the Twilight phenomenon presented at Gothic Study Day at the British Film Institute, 9 November 2013, attended by 60-80 people.
