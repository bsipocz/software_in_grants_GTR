A post-structuralist perspective was used to provide an original study on how care discourses manifest themselves in the provision of care services. &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>At the international scale, fieldwork trips to conduct interviews in health research institutes as well as carer organisations were undertaken. At the local scale, 47 interviews were carried out in Ireland with carers, statutory and voluntary carer agencies. The international perspective revealed that the construction of social ?norms? regarding the role of family and disability has led to very distinct local practices. &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>In England, the portrayal of the family carer as a major national concern has constructed a landscape of care which normalises the role of the family in sustaining their independence, thus having an elaborate community support system. &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>In the US, the dilemma of rearing a disabled person in a society grounded in values of independence has meant the care recipient is typically the target of social support. Ireland, in comparison, has a unique blend of Catholic ?family? policy and neo-liberal statutory provision, which at the local level has led to ad hoc service provision and weak social rights for caregivers.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50581</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Care Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>025F5266-4CA2-47C7-91B0-469E713EA4AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I organised a day-long conference, 'Debates in Informal Care' related to my ESRC post-doctoral funding. It had a wide audience including national and local carer groups, including Carers UK, as well as those involved in care research and policy-evaluation, including Prof. Caroline Glendinning. I chaired the days' activities and developed questions for break-out groups to debate, relating to my research from the fellowship.

The seminar helped position me amongst national carer stakeholders and senior colleagues in my field of care research. Feedback at the event showed evidence of changes in views and opinions of delegates, particularly around their understanding of the complex geographies of care, and the need for more sensitively designed and flexible services.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f98af49fa01.17083182</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/doc_library/ihr/informal_caregiving_details_nov07.doc</gtr:url><gtr:year>2007</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Geographical Society of Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5114BEAB-41C5-4486-9408-3F20B371EDAC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited seminar, at the Geography Department Seminar Series, NUI Galway, Ireland.

The participation at the RGS-IBG conference helped copperfasten my research profile within the field and bridge connections with other geographers whose work I had read. Many of these people have subsequently become close peers who I have continued to work with together on subsequent events and collaborative projects (e.g. Dr Ed Hall, Prof. Chris Philo, Prof. Christine Milligan)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546338f9a6c415.82178044</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rgs.org/WhatsOn/ConferencesAndSeminars/Annual+International+Conference/Past+conferences.htm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2007</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Liverpool Medical Sociology Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4D1CD37-EA64-4281-AEDE-F3BC637FAA9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a paper from the fellowship research entitled, 'Care and Dependency: the terrible twins?

Presenting my research at this conference was an important step in widen the scope and reach of my work to a wider audience. It also helped stimulate further correspondence and connections between myself and delegates at the conference who attended my presentation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546336e3813432.94572312</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.britsoc.co.uk/medical-sociology/medsoc-annual-conference-archives.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2007</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lancaster Religious Studies Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>164D7BE8-7CC0-463C-A2FA-5CEFF198FFBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a paper, 'In the Arms of the Church: The Religious Discourse of Family Duties and Social Services in Ireland', at the Negotiating Religious Identity Conference at Lancaster University.

It attracted a large international audience of health geography researchers, and helped stimulate thinking around comparative examples of voluntarism and how voluntary organisations can 'jump scale' from local to national and vice versa.

The questions sparked afterwards helped sharpen the comparative focus of my paper, which in turn helped others appreciate the complex geographies of voluntary care provision and the need to be attuned to the diverse networks and funding streams linked to voluntary organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546331a777ca28.42462770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://public.beuth-hochschule.de/~kred/akmedgeo/imgs2007/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Debates in Informal Caregiving Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:end>2007-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Foundation for the Sociology of Health and Illness</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B9AFDF02-2F26-41E6-BA28-4982A5902F8D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f91969a6be0.88799181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings from the geographies of family care fellowship have helped inform research within a range of disciplines, including disability studies, sociology, health research as well as inform wider debates concerning the 'place' of informal carers within the wider social care field. 

Informal caregiving was a previously undeveloped field both within geography and more generally within the social sciences. Indeed, it was a field in which disability studies actively resisted a focus on carers as it feared that care research would undermine work focusing on the primary rights of the disabled person. As a consequence, many disability organisations were reluctant to engage in debates over better care services.

In particular, my work has helped dispel much concern about the motives of carers and gives an account of how carers actively seek to promote the independence of their disabled sons or daughters and identifies support interventions which can help carers better achieve this goal. This central plank from the research framed the focus of my 'Debates in Informal Care' conference and subsequent book, Landscapes of Care, which was given to the CEO of Carers UK who also attended and spoke at the conference. 

I have since continued to develop my research career in a way that has continually sought to build on the work conducted during my fellowship as well as widen the scope of this work within the current context of personalisation and extend my links to policy stakeholders.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D482C729-490D-4A96-B65D-B41938881EFF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545fb97cb56068.53099879</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This postdoctoral fellowship grant was focused on the geographies of 'informal' family caring. Using a geographical approach the research revealed the complex social and spatial experiences of carers, in the home and in public space. It also revealed their experiences of distinct 'carer spaces', including respite centres, local health centres and carer groups. 

One of the first key findings was that carers of young adults with learning disabilities often felt caught in the middle with the tension between promoting independence of their care recipient on the one hand and worrying about being over-protective on the other hand. Carers had thus developed coping strategies to deal with local people's experiences of disabilities, to mediate in difficult social situations with their adult disabled sons or daughters.

A second key finding was that carers often felt frustrated by non-supportive interactions from services that were designed to support carers. These interactions stemmed from services being too provider-led rather than user-led and being inflexible and too risk adverse. For example, many found that respite centres only catered for clients with very mild disabilities and no challenging behaviour or extra medical conditions.

A third contribution from the project was an appraisal of the ad hoc and fragmented nature of the voluntary sector within social care due to its particular local contexts and the scale at which it takes place across a country. And yet, it is this sector that the government is increasingly turning to, in order to fill gaps in welfare services. 

More generally, at the international scale, the work compared welfare services across the UK, the US and Ireland. The comparative focus enabled me to identify the much broader historical, social/cultural and political regimes of care in each jurisdiction, and how caregivers are perceived, recognised and supported differently in each context.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings were taken forward through the publication of three papers in relevant policy-oriented and social care journals as well as the publication of a monograph and co-written book chapter. Finally, an Informal Care conference was organised at the end of the project. 

The first finding identified above - about carers' complex balancing of promoting independence and being over-protective - was published in the top-ranking international journal, Social Science and Medicine. The paper continues to be well-cited by others working in healthcare, disability and geography research, as the findings offer an important counter-argument to the negative portrayal of carers as enforcing dependency of disabled people. 

The second key finding - about nonsupportive interactions- was published in a paper 'It's the the system working for the system' for Health and Social care in the Community. The journal is aimed at those working in and those researching the social care sector. The findings in the paper have contributed to debates over the current experiences of frustration with inflexible support providers which has led to calls for more person-centred services.

The third contribution from the project - on the uneven geographies of the voluntary sector in social care - was a paper for the policy-oriented international journal, Journal of Social Policy. This was centrally aimed at being of use to a social policy audience and focused on the importance of recognising the uneven and at times precarious nature of voluntarism particularly in the context of care services. The paper draws on an Irish case-study, as this is a jurisdiction where the state advocated a 'hands-off' approach in learning disability services from the outset and promoted the voluntary sector as the primary source of support provision.

The final, more broad scale work from the project on the international comparisons of care policy was published in a monograph for Ashgate, Landscapes of Care. This text has filled a gap within the literature, as most work in this field is conducted at very local scales in relation to particular interventions.

During the fellowship, I also co-wrote a chapter with Prof. Christine Milligan on the Geographies of Care for a health geography textbook. This is a student-oriented text and thus has served to disseminate our work on care to a wider audience through the teaching of geographies of health at university level.

In addition to the written outputs from the project, I also organised a conference, Debates in Informal Care, which brought together both academics and national and local carer groups including the national carer organisation, Carers UK. The event stimulated debate over contemporary issues affecting carers. I also established a critical online carer forum, launched at this event which is still active today.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>86DE8668-83D7-4916-89C1-3E6CCF4AD69A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545fb83e39d7e6.33806402</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4E0021EF-FEA2-43BA-B877-F7597FAA8524</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning and Memory Developments and Intellectual Disabilities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/46d807c9d5953699f34863c2003eabd2"><gtr:id>46d807c9d5953699f34863c2003eabd2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Power, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-61122-534-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54633d2a1edae0.99420924</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B3C39E51-DC68-4FBD-BFA6-62DBB803F74B</gtr:id><gtr:title>'It's the system working for the system': carers' experiences of learning disability services in Ireland.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health &amp;
