Despite this, there is no book that deals with the technological side of Venetian Renaissance bronzes: and so this is the aim of my book.\n\nOver the last decade or so, Venetian Renaissance bronzes (as well as those produced in other centres) have come under increasingly close scrutiny from art-historians, historians of scientific theory and practice, historians of material culture, consumption and luxury and by scholars interested in collection history and display. Scientific analysis, namely elemental analyses (via alloy samples and x-ray fluorescence) and historical technology examination (using a variety of radiological techniques, endoscopy and microscopy), is being complemented by experimental and experiential reconstruction analysis and in-depth archival analysis. These diverse approaches are revealing a great deal of new information about authorship, patronage, dating, material, facture, technique, function, reception and subsequent history. \n\nDespite these new disciplinary perspectives, traditional academic boundaries still persist with the result that these diverse approaches are rarely considered together. Moreover, bronzes still tend to be classified according to type (as defined by function) and studied within isolated categories (fine art; decorative art; guns; bells) / despite the fact that they were often made by the same people in the same foundry. As a result, much of the literature on Venetian Renaissance bronzes is highly specialised, narrowly focused and not interdisciplinary. It is also widely scattered and a great deal of the most fundamental and exciting new research is known only to a relatively small circle of scholars. The few books that do consider functional and decorative bronzes together are broad overviews with large geographical and/or chronological limits and, as a result, present very general conclusions that shed little light on the specific situation in Venice.\n\nBy applying a variety of scholarly approaches to the whole spectrum of pieces, my book aims to address this situation, and to provide a holistic view of the bronze industry in Renaissance Venice and to chart its development in terms of protagonists, work-places and working practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18189</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F005261/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
