Since all proteins are made inside the bacterium the extracellular proteins must be moved out of the cell across the normally impermeable cell membrane. This task is carried out by machines termed protein transporters that are located in the cell membrane. One type of transporter moves unfolded proteins, threading them across the membrane like string through the eye of a needle. By contrast, a second type of transporter, which we term the Tat system, moves folded proteins across the membrane. We want to study the Tat transporter in a bacterium called Streptomyces coelicolor. S. coelicolor is an organism that lives in the soil. It lives on dead plant and animal material and to break this material down it needs to export lots of proteins through the Tat transporter. S. coelicolor has a complex lifecycle because it germinates from a spore which grows into structures called hyphae. These hyphae can be thought of as long tubes, and we have shown that the Tat transporter is located at the very tip of these tubes. We have shown this by adding a label to one of the proteins involved in the Tat pathway which makes it appear as coloured spot when viewed in a special type of microscope. In this project we want to understand why and how the Tat transporter is located here. Some of the experiments we will do will find out whether other transporters are also located at the tips of these hyphae by labeling them in a similar way. We want to find mutants of S. coelicolor where the Tat transporter is no longer located in its normal place. We can use these mutants to give us information about the processes that help to locate the Tat transporter at the correct place in the cell.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Tat protein transport system functions to export folded proteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Proteins are targeted to the Tat machinery by N-terminal signal peptides that harbour an almost invariant twin arginine motif. Our studies have shown that the Tat pathway is a major route of protein export in the Gram positive soil organism Streptomyces coelicolor. EGFP-tagging of the essential TatB protein of the S. coelicolor Tat system at single copy showed that this protein is localized at the tips of the vegetative hyphae, This is therefore analagous to tip-localized secretion of proteins previously observed for filamentous fungi. In this application we aim to address whether: 1. Other components of the Tat machinery also show tip-localization, and whether tip-localization is dependent upon a functional Tat system; 2. Whether other exporters and uptake systems also show tip localization; 3. Whether new Tat subunits are added directly to the hyphal tip or if they are synthesized elsewhere and subsequently accumulate at the tip. 4. The mechanism by which the Tat machinery is targeted to and retained at the hyphal tip.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>357327</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of East Anglia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Biological Sciences UEA</gtr:department><gtr:description>MIH</gtr:description><gtr:id>B7A15352-6964-403C-B35F-0F06F444311F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work led to the fuding of a two postdoc grant from the BBSRC.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>1728FBF55B2-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Streptomyces biology</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have identified that Tat proteins in Streptomyces ceolicolor are also lipoproteins.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Magnificent Microbes</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C60C148E-43C5-47A9-958E-30BF42C9785A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two day Magnificent Microbes event that run in association with Sensations, Dundee's Science Centre.

We were able to demonstrate that the Streptomyces coelicolor TatB and TatC proteins co-localize to the tips of emergent hyphae during spore germination.



2. We identified a gene, sco5152, which is encoded in the genetic neighbourhood of tatB (sco5150). This codes for a predicted ParA-like protein and we obtained preliminary evidence that this is involved in the localization of TatB.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>While the grant proposal is hypothesis the work produced potentially has applied impact:

Knowledge of the Tat mechanism will underpin efforts to exploit the Tat pathway for biotechnological purposes e.g. secretion to aid downstream processing of protein products of commercial or therapeutic utility. Streptomyces, the organism in which we undertook these studies, is used in the biotech industry.

The College of Life Science has a great deal of experience of engaging with industry regarding commercialisation of discoveries. Research and Innovation Services have an office within the CLS research complex and a member of the team attends each formal meeting held by the division. The RIS team have a large number of industrial contacts and close links to Scottish Enterprise. This will help to maximise the impact of all findings of commercial value. 

The RIS team also have strong links with the Dundee University Incubator, a facility aimed at housing and nurturing spin-out companies in the biosciences. Related to the incubator, is a collaboration between the publicly- and privately-funded biotechnology sectors in Dundee called Bio-Dundee which aims to connect local academics and industries to allow collaboration. This is achieved through both formal and informal events.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A27DB484-FD9E-4EE9-A9B6-3C6BFB85BDF2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9508919119.3775447772a24c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A446E3EB-7A12-433F-A6C2-8859FE4C927A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic localization of Tat protein transport machinery components in Streptomyces coelicolor.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of bacteriology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/501bde515cd0b2f29d3af4f63de34bd7"><gtr:id>501bde515cd0b2f29d3af4f63de34bd7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Willemse J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9193</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_13645_25_23002216</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5E404A5D-054F-4DF6-9320-D1288FF1DBCB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The complex extracellular biology of Streptomyces.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>FEMS microbiology reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/75d8048e52f817a50972db1230fe8864"><gtr:id>75d8048e52f817a50972db1230fe8864</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chater KF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0168-6445</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc033c033c6eafb</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3B89C7D4-2DAC-4BD6-9DB6-76CCDE2C3BB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spotlight onTracy Palmer.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>FEMS microbiology letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/27a39a45966d32b9c5d05104380446ee"><gtr:id>27a39a45966d32b9c5d05104380446ee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Palmer T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0378-1097</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58999f1114b5f4.38060325</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F002947/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
