An understanding the underlying processes is necessary to promote effective transferable management strategies. This is especially important in the marine environment where there are few obvious boundaries to gene flow. Biodiversity is lost within populations by drift &amp;amp; directional selection, and retained among populations by the same processes. The size of insular populations helps to determine the dominant process, since drift is stronger than selection in small populations. It is known that much natural diversity is divided among conspecific populations by these processes, but the fragmented structure of this diversity is often cryptic, especially in poorly understood environments like the deep sea. 

We typically define populations a priori by geographic distance and according to apparent physical boundaries. However, in addition to spatial factors, environmental characteristics can affect patterns of connectivity by affecting the rate and direction of gene flow, and this influence will vary as environments change over time. Environmental characteristics also drive local selection, and selection can maintain differences among populations even with continuing gene flow. Without knowledge about how local populations may have adapted to local environments, we remain unable to incorporate that type of biodiversity into conservation strategy, and to address its potential importance to the long-term survival of species. Understanding the function and value of biodiversity requires a better understanding of the interacting processes of selection and drift leading to its evolution and loss. While much of the relevant theory is well established, empirical data are required to test theory and determine how environmental factors interact with evolutionary processes in natural systems. 

In this study we will employ second generation sequencing technologies to investigate how environmental factors are associated with the evolution of population structure and speciation in the deep sea, at both neutral and functional loci. The particular focus will be on habitat depth and isolation by distance, however other environmental factors will be quantified at collection sites based on data collected from the same sites during the recent ECOMAR consortium study (during which samples for the proposed study were collected). The study species will be fish in the genus Coryphaenoides, a specious genus of deep demersal fishes, some of which are commercially important fisheries species (including the primary focal species in this study, C. rupestris). Initial studies have shown phylogenetic lineage division correleted to habitat depth. Other work has indicated selection at genes associated with adaptation to pressure in some of these species. Two focal Coryphaenoides species will be investigated in a comparative population genomics study. These species, C. rupestris and C. brevibarbis are sympatric, but the former is found at shallower depths than the latter. We will test hypotheses about how habitat division by depth or other characteristics (e.g. current systems or geographic distance) may determine the evolution of intra- and inter-specific diversity (including among multiple habitat-specialist species in the genus using an extended phylogenetic assessment) both by drift (through differential environmental pressures associated with dispersal) and by selection. Greater connectivity is predicted in the abyssal habitat, which may lead to larger effective population sizes and facilitate adaptive evolution. Taken together these data will provide novel insight into the interactive role of drift and selection during the evolution of diversity, and transferable inference about how diversity is structured in the deep sea.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of this work beyond the beneficiaries in the academic community will be on fisheries management and commercial fisheries working in the deep sea. In the eastern North Atlantic (including the high seas area out to and including the mid-Atlantic ridge) deep-sea fisheries management comes under the jurisdiction of the European Commission and the North-East Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Deep-sea stocks are defined as those living at depths of 400m or greater. Although fishing by factory trawlers and modern longliners started in the eastern North Atlantic in the late 1960s, regulation was introduced only recently, beginning in 2002 with the introduction of the first 'total allowable catch' (TAC) quotas (setting quotas for 2003). This covered eight species, among which was the roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris, a focal subject species in this study). Two further species were later added together with a quota for a collection of 11 deep-sea shark species (considered together) for 2005 and 2006. TAC allowances are now set for a given EC country and ICES fisheries region separately. One recognised problem with this approach is that deep-sea fisheries are typically multi-species in character, based on trawling or gil-net fisheries. A targeted species allowance assumes that there is a simple relationship between the recorded landing records and effort for that species, which is unlikely to be the case in multi-species fisheries. This could mean that there is greater impact from fisheries for a given species than indicated in the catch records, and so greater impact on genetic diversity. In 2009 the NEAFC agreed to adopt a measure that closed 330,000 square km to bottom fishing at the mid-Atlantic ridge, including our core study area in that region near the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone. There are concerns about the effectiveness of this measure as well, as many of the target species have different geographic distributions at different life stages, likely including the grenadier species in this study, due to larval drift on oceanic currents (and regions near the study area at the mid-Atlantic ridge remain a focus of roundnose grenadier fisheries). 

Our data will help to resolve this question. The roundnose grenadier has had the highest quota assigned among all of the managed species, with a total of 12,443 tonnes allowed in 2005 falling to 8,109 tonnes for 2011 (but still the highest TAC quota for a deep-sea fish). However, little is know for any of the subject species about whether or not regional populations should be managed separately. Our study will address this question for the roundnose grenadier for most regions of primary importance to the fishery (ICES areas VI, VII &amp;amp; XII) using a very high resolution methodology, however of greater importance will be the general assessment of drivers of stock structuring in the deep sea, and insight into the best methods for assigning management areas. We will also provide detailed information on the distribution of diversity at functional genetic markers for the first time for a deep sea fish species, and assess their potential relevance in biodiversity conservation and management. Details of our findings will be brought to the attention of the NEAFC and European Commission for consideration. Deep-sea fisheries managers will be among those included in our program of end-user engagement. Other interested end users will include the general public with an interest in life in the deep sea. Through recent involvement in the Census of Marine Life project MARECO (focussed on life in the deep sea at the mid-Atlantic ridge), it was evident that our outreach for that project was highly popular and successful, indicating a broad interest in discoveries about this largely unknown ecosystem. We will establish a web page providing explanations for a lay audience, updates, images and news and also publish in the popular media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>397273</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Liverpool Centre for Genomic Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>Genomics</gtr:description><gtr:id>7C9A1BF6-F901-4523-8204-B2622CA49AFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data generated for NE/J014443/1 on population genomics and phylogenomics (see publications) were an outcome of this collaboration.

Our final meeting with the working group was very productive, and two interactions have continued, facilitating further inference and interpretation. In particular, we are now developing a stronger link between work on the ecology and conservation management of the subject species, studied at Marine Scotland, and our data from genomic analyses. We are finding increasingly compelling evidence for the need to manage population more carefully by habitat depth, and a major publication on the subject is in preparation, including collaborative analyses with colleagues at Marine Scotland.

For this work we are focusing on the deep-sea fishes in the genus Coryphaenoides, of which there are 65 recognized species. To assess the evolutionary relationships among species and test hypotheses concerning drivers of divergence we have produced the most complete phylogeny for the group to date. Using 3,048 bp of Sanger sequence data across 28 species, our analyses show divisions among species that correlate with depth. We have found that species that are able to reside at abyssal depths form a distinct and well supported lineage. The finding that all abyssal species fall into a single lineage indicates that colonization of the abyss happened just once and that movement into the deepest depths of the oceans requires special adaptation. Our manuscript on this topic was published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution in 2016. 

To investigate the processes driving population subdivision (within species) we have produced over 800 billion bases (GB) of genomic 'RADseq' data across approximately 400 individuals in the two focal species in this study (C. brevibarbis and C. rupestris). Using these data to improve our understanding of the way that key environmental factors and geographic features influence population structure and local adaptation we developed 4738 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci across 5 populations of C. brevibarbis along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Our data matrix of 102 individuals is now complete. Analyses of the neutral loci indicate only weak population structure across the region (detected only using ordination methods). In contrast, signals of population structure in outlier loci indicate that selection may be acting on populations particularly across the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone. We decided to incorporate our C. brevibarbis genomic data (see below) into the analyses, and are now finalizing this work and are preparing the manuscript. The C. rupestris dataset includes approximately 300 individuals across 9 populations in the North Atlantic including one population in Skagerak, Norway. We have now completed RADseq analyses both for the 9 regional populations and for deep and shallow water samples around the Hebrides considered separately. For the former we used 4989 neutral SNPs and for the latter 6657. We have mapped the outlier reads against our C. rupestris genome to improve resolution and to identify outlier loci, potentially under selection. These data reinforce the findings associated with differential selection at different depths. We completed resequencing the genomes (5x coverage) of 60 C. rupestris from a single location across a depth gradient (800, 1000, 1500, and 1800m). These genomes were mapped back to the genome assembly (described below) to identify millions of loci for population level analyses. Those analyses identified loci associated with habitat depth with fixed genetic differences within coding genes at non-synonymous sites. Roughly 30 loci showed strong outlier status, based on the comparison by depth, using 'Manhattan' plot comparisons. We have genotyped individuals at some of these loci more widely, and are analysing these data in the context of Hardy-Weinberg expectations. We find that selection based on habitat depth is supported across the species range in the North Pacific. Together with inference about life history, ecology, and the genotypes of juveniles, we are drafting a major paper to be submitted in the near future.

We have learned novel inference about stock structure within and among geographic regions, and tested hypotheses about the implications for the role of life history and environmental factors (especially depth) in the evolution and loss of diversity in this ecologically important species. To more fully investigate the role of depth in driving divergence in deep-sea organisms we sequenced the genomes of 14 species across the genus including 7 species from the abyssal lineage. A high coverage assembly of the C. rupestris genome (0.83GB at 120x coverage - still undergoing final refinement) has been achieved via a combination of PacBio and Illumina sequencing. We also produced RNAseq data for different tissue types from C. rupestis which was used to facilitate annotation of the C. rupestris genome, providing a high-quality genome for this species with annotation to a good level of resolution. Additionally, a 91x coverage assembly of the C. brevibarbis genome and 5x coverage of the other 12 genomes have been produced and mapped back to the C. rupestris assembly. The goal of this ambitious effort is twofold: to produce annotated genomes of deep-sea fishes that will be invaluable resources to the broader scientific community and to identify regions of the genome that correlate with adaptation to depth. By directly comparing the genomes of these species we will identify regions that may have been involved in adaptation to abyssal depths. Most of the bioinformatic work has been completed for this aspect of the project, and initial drafts of the papers have been outlined. As a further extension of this work we are sequencing loci showing evidence for strong selection associated with habitat depth for a broader range of teleost fish found at different depths. This aspect of the project is still underway. It is our expectation that 5-6 further papers will be in review or in press by the time of the next assessment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To ensure that the results of our work reaches end-users we have multiple manuscripts in prep, one in print and are publishing our results as soon as analyses allow. Also, in year 1 we put together a panel of research biologists and resource managers to provide feedback and make suggestions concerning our work. Each is an expert in different aspects of deep-sea biology, fisheries, and conservation. The working group met via virtual workshops and resulted in further collaborations for broader impact.

We will emphasise results from our study, working with stake holders and policy makers, to help ensure improved fisheries management strategies.

We also constructed a website (http://www.deepseaevolution.com/) to help disseminate information both to the public and to relevant conservation agencies. The website has a front end that explains the science in lay terms, describes the problems faced by resource managers, and outlines how our project will address management concerns. The website includes a blog for public feedback, summary of working group meetings and links to other relevant and important websites. 

All data will be made available on public databases, and will provide a significant and novel resource, including high quality genomes for two species living in environments that generate selective pressures associated with physiological and behavioural adaptation to depth. Extensive draft genomic data will be made available for an additional 12 species in the same genus. Our data on specific loci that are associated with living at different ocean depths will provide raw material for those interested in protein function and adaptive change in the context of environmental change.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD68E1AD-37EC-4FAF-9025-C5E3330BCCA5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b931568bbb2.85399445</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.deepseaevolution.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2EB5FF40-8394-4DEC-A89E-57DA20A01ADC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genomics of habitat choice and adaptive evolution in a deep-sea fish.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature ecology &amp; evolution</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d05977f78636e8cb74ce6a7e8f92696f"><gtr:id>d05977f78636e8cb74ce6a7e8f92696f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gaither MR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2397-334X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa235fecf47e4.36394697</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F1DE2A35-4470-41AB-B3D0-C708EDF36D97</gtr:id><gtr:title>Depth as a driver of evolution in the deep sea: Insights from grenadiers (Gadiformes: Macrouridae) of the genus Coryphaenoides.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular phylogenetics and evolution</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d05977f78636e8cb74ce6a7e8f92696f"><gtr:id>d05977f78636e8cb74ce6a7e8f92696f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gaither MR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1055-7903</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d7d3ca55a93.29648127</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D25D3370-BE97-4741-A8F2-64916DC00173</gtr:id><gtr:title>Assessing ecological and molecular divergence between the closely related species Hydrolagus pallidus and H. affinis (Chimaeridae).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of fish biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f98885638ecd8ddf402c964c9f96d5c1"><gtr:id>f98885638ecd8ddf402c964c9f96d5c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Violi B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1112</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa235ff0d5194.61558482</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K005359/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE30777A-E4A8-486B-875D-58CC92FD5525</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2CF6994C-A1AE-435B-853C-2C228927BC9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systematics &amp; Taxonomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
