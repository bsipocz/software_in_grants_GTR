This question has gained salience since the EU has stepped up its role in the region to facilitate these countries' alignment with EU rules, norms and standards (the acquis).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, no precedent exists for EU's promotion of the acquis as a template for development without the concurrent membership prospective. Thus the EU engagement in the post-Soviet states provides an excellent opportunity to analyse the EU's transformative power' outside the context of enlargement.&lt;br />The project examines the domestic process and outcomes of convergence with EU rules in four post-Soviet states: Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The overarching objective is to assess the impact of EU policies against the background of partner countries' domestic structures and policy preferences, and the influence of other external players.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is on four policy fields:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>anti-corruption measures&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>regulation of state aid&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>visa facilitation/liberalisation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the energy sector.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project uses a triangulation of qualitative research methods:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>documentary analysis&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>semi-structured interviews with officials from the case studies countries and the EU&lt;/li>

Four case studies explored four sectors: food safety, state aid, gas market, and visa liberalisation. 

The project generated original and comparative findings providing unprecedented insights into the impact of the EU on domestic transformation in the post-Soviet countries. This resulted in high demand for our expertise and intensive dissemination and engagement with policy makers.

Since late 2013, the events in Ukraine, (U-turn on the association Agreement which triggered mass protests and change of political leadership), has attracted even more attention to our project and intensified interests from academia and policy makers, including EU governments and international organisations.

Academic impact been achieved by a number of scholarly publications (see the list of outputs) and participation in numerous academic conferences.

The project application envisaged delivering 4 briefing papers. Overall, the project produced the following policy-oriented studies, papers and briefs:

Media Commentary
Over 2013-15 Kataryna Wolczuk has commented extensive on EU's eastern policy and the Ukrainian crisis and the war in Eastern Ukraine. She has given numerous interviews to UK and international media, including BBC Radio 4, BBC World Service, BBC News, Euronews, BBC5live, BBC WM, Austrian International Radio, Radio Free Europe/Liberity and various international newspapers (such as the top China weekly magazine). Sometimes, she gave several interviews in one day (for example, on Sunday, 30 March 2014 she gave TV interviews to BBC News, BBC World and two radio interviews to Radio 5Live). 

Finally, as a result of the high-profile in the field, Dr Wolczuk was invited to join the Steering Committee of the new initiative, Ukraine Forum, launched at Chatham House in July 2015 and to become an Associate Fellow at Chatham House.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>587936E9-F0DC-4150-827E-27FAE8FDECC5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5592b064961ae9.63653770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project explored the impact of the EU on domestic change in the post-Soviet countries. The main findings are as follows:

1. Key academic findings:
a) The EU has become an influential actor in the post-Soviet region especially since the launch of the Eastern Partnership (EaP) in 2009 in those countries which negotiated the Association Agreements (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine).

b) Overall, the EU is effective in promoting domestic change even in countries without membership aspirations and/or perspective. This indicates a more limited role of the membership perspective than assumed in in the existing academic literature on non-accession Europeanisation. 

c) EU conditionality related to Agreements and visa liberalisation, combined with targeted assistance, are the key mechanisms through which the EU affects domestic change. 

d) there are considerable differences in the EU's policies towards individual countries. So the EU policy towards the Eastern neighbourhood is not uniform and needs to be analysed through policy-implementation (the country level) rather than at policy inception (EU institutions). 

e) The EU's impact varies considerably across different countries/sectors. This diversity can only be explained by combining EU-level factors with domestic and regional factors. This is because of a combination of factors such as: the economic and political costs induced by EU reforms, the complexity of reforms required by the EU, as well as their political sensitivity in partner countries resulting from strong vested interests (e.g. the energy sector). The EU's mechanisms of policy transfer provided an impetus to reforms when these reforms meet domestic elites' interests (Moldova after 2009, Armenia 2009-13, Ukraine 2014) and/or regional conditions were conducive (Georgia after 2008, Armenia 2009-13). 

f) However, domestic factors largely account for the 'shallow' and fragmented nature of reforms, insofar as domestic implementation is concerned. EU-induced reforms tend to focus on legislative changes (legal approximation) with implementation lagging behind.

g) Regional factors (the influence of Russia) initially played only limited role at the sectoral level (except the energy sector). However, Russia become a powerful 'spoiler' actor during 2013, i.e. during the conclusion of the Association Agreements. In Armenia, Russia dissuaded the President from signing the Agreement. In Ukraine Russia's offered financial incentives to president Yanukovych to not sign - resulting in mass protests and a change of political regime. Yet, ultimately, in the three countries that concluded the Agreement with the EU, Russia's coercive strategies have acted as a powerful catalyst for Europeanisation. 


2. Conduct of research
a. Research on the impact of the EU on domestic change in neighbouring countries requires intensive, country-specific research, involving extensive fieldwork and multiple sectors. Originally, the plan was to conduct fieldwork separately, but upon the launch of the project, with the French partner (funded by the ANR, the French counterpart of the ESRC) we coordinated our efforts and all fieldwork missions were conducted jointly. This required close coordination but greatly facilitated not only a shared understanding and comparative analysis but also the rapid production of policy-oriented publications. 

b. The energy sector (liberalisation of the gas market) was most difficult to research due to political sensitivities and vested interests. Nevertheless, in all the countries, there was a great degree of interest/willingness to interact with the researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) The key findings are especially salient in the context of the implementation of the Association Agreements, which pose a formidable, long-term challenge for the eastern partners (Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia).

2) Russia's role has been defined in terms of blocking integration with the EU in the post-Soviet space. This 'blocking' has been especially evident in the challenge presented to the statehood of Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014). However, the impact of Russia's strategies on domestic change appears more nuanced with both Georgia and Ukraine becoming more determined to pursue European integration and implementing related domestic reforms, as a result of Russia's coercion. Therefore, developments in the region call for re-assessing the role of regional factors, in particular - even though not exclusively - the influence of Russia.

3) Therefore, with the crisis in Ukraine attracting attention to the EU's role in the eastern neighbourhood, more scholarly attention should be paid to the domestic context as well as the role of Russia in hindering and/or facilitating integration with the EU. The diversification in the Eastern neighbourhood calls for a radical overhaul of research design strategy, de-centring from EU-level factors and shifting attention to the 'target countries' and the regional context in which they find themselves.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>186C0366-32C3-4BE9-A007-26A8436EBB80</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3559667536.578763b2f2fdfc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://euimpacteast.org/-English-.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>13168628-DA1A-4B6C-ABC5-A5026450C9BE</gtr:id><gtr:title>EU External Relations - Law and Policy in the Post-Lisbon Era: 2012</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bb1cb566531ffc80df3027ee03515f28"><gtr:id>bb1cb566531ffc80df3027ee03515f28</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dragneva R and Wolczuk K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9789067048224</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-3248132256.09076453b97d11a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>823607CC-485A-4A32-9F68-0C90FA6B46B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The EU's Unexpected 'Ideal Neighbour'?
