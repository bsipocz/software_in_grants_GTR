 &lt;li>In what ways are changes in economic and social policies associated with changes in crime rates anxieties about crime?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do shifts in social values affect national-level experiences and beliefs about crime and appropriate responses to it (such as support for punitiveness)?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What have been the long-term consequences of neo-liberal and neo-conservative social and economic policies for the UK's criminal justice system and crime?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>In what ways do changes in social and economic circumstances lead to changes in crime rates 'downstream'?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Conversely, in what ways do changes in crime rates affect social and economic policies?.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Which social economic groups are most affected with regards to experiences of crime? What lessons can be learnt for the future?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Our aim is to understand the long-term trajectory of crime alongside political, social and economic developments (and in so doing to develop an approach for making such assessments which could also be used by other researchers). Using time series modelling, the project will chart these trends generally as well as exploring the impact of the growing existence and tolerance of economic inequalities since the 1970s on a range of key processes related to crime (such as, for example, popular sentiments towards the treatment of offenders).&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Five impact activities are planned. These are:

* a seminar held jointly with the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, London, aimed at policy makers, people working in 'think tanks', academics and journalists, 

* a workshop held jointly with the UK Data Service, in Manchester, aimed at encouraging the use of the data set which we will have produced and time series analyses generally,

* an email circulation list to keep colleagues and potential users of the data set produced informed of progress, and

* the lodging of the data set with the Data Archive once the project is completed.

* the production of a film about the impact of Thatcherite social and economic policies on crime (in the style of a historial documentary).


We believe that the research project will benefit the following groups: 

* those researching politics, contemporary (i.e. post-second world war British) history, criminology and public policy,

* those with an interest in the long and medium term consequences of shifts in political philosophies and their resulting impacts (those in think tanks and government departments),

* those outside of the UK studying countries where analogous changes have been undertaken.

 
Such groups, we believe, will benefit from this research because we seek to:

* Understand processes of change and policy implementation over a long period;

* Understand some of the unintended consequences of dramatic policy change(s), their unexpected and 'double effects';

* Understand trajectories of change at national and sub-national levels.

They will also benefit more directly from our commitment to lodge the resulting data set with the UK Data Archive, thereby allowing others to use the data we have collated for their own purposes. 


In order to ensure that potential beneficaries have the opportunity to benefit from this research we shall: 

* publicise the research via our own and the ESRC's web sites;

* attend a number of the most appropriate national and international conferences in order to formally present our papers and to present posters relating to our work and to engage in debate with other researchers;

* exploit our existing network of contacts within the UK's policy and think tank communities, including writing commissioned articles for such bodies


All of those involved in the project have a great deal of experience in communicating their research to practitioners and those working in policy and think tanks (see CVs). They are often invited to provide short articles for such audiences and are well connected in this respect. All have experience of working with the media, thereby ensuring a wider dissemination of their research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>262405</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Generation Right is a 42min film which outlines the impact of Thatcherite thinking on the UK's social and economic policies and culture.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BAB428B8-BE3F-4161-B1F8-7CC7DA08D0DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film has been demonstrated to have changed audiences' minds about the period of history which we document in the film.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55892ae3194fd7.97165972</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Generation Right (2015)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medina FIlms</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Making a film called 'Generation RIght'</gtr:description><gtr:id>4B3971E3-4EEE-4511-BDD2-1EEA73626905</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 42min film called 'Generation Right'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55892d23a1f526.96413583-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Directing and producing the film.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We helped make the film; commissioning it and providing ideas on the content of the film.

For example, the film we commissioned ('Generation Right') has been shown to numerous audiences and their responses to it gauged. For example, we have shown the film at a number of film festivals around the world (where it won several awards). We have shown the film at Festivals of Social Science, 6th form colleges, and other venues. After the showings (wherever possible) we ask people to fill in a short questionnaire of 3 questions on the degree to which the film has made them want to find out more about the 1980s, gave them insights which were new to them, and which changed their opinions of that era. This has suggested that the vast majority of viewers wanted to find out more about that period of British history, felt that they understood the key issues better (both around 60-70%) and that around 50% of them felt differently about that era having watched the film. This various by audience, with 6th form college students particularly influenced by it. 

'Generation Right'; has been shown at the following events:

DocFest (2015, UK); East End Film Festival (2015, UK); The Dukes Cinema (2015, UK); Festival of Social Science (2015, UK); Aberdeen Film Festival (2015, UK); Doc Utah International Documentary Film Festival (2015, USA); Cincinnati Film Festival (2015, USA); Oregon Film Festival (2015, USA); Sydney Documentary Film Festival (2015, Australia); Ridgefield International Film Festival, (2016, USA); City Univ. (2016, UK); Birmingham Univ. (2016, UK); Lift-Off Festival, Liverpool (2016, UK); Univ. of Sheffield Women's Network (2016, UK); Oxford Brooks (2016, UK); Derby Film Festival (2016, UK); Honolulu Film Festival (2016, USA). Won Gold Award in the Documentary Short competition at the Oregon Film Awards (2015); Won Silver Award in the Spotlight Documentary Film Awards (2015); won Silver Lei at the Honolulu Film Festival (2016). It has also been shown at various 6th form colleges in conjunction with the Speakers for Schools programme.

With the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies in London, we organised a one-day session on Long-term Trends in Crime, on the 18th September 2015. This resulted in several newspapers covering some of the key findings of the project. For example, The Independent (16/9/2015) ran a story under the headline 'Zero-hours contracts 'have helped to break link between unemployment and crime'', whilst the London Evening Standard (22/9/2015) wrote about the same findings under the headline 'UK and French universities research challenges the link between unemployment and rising crime'. Similar stories were run by The Yorkshire Post (16/9/2015), Science Daily (21/9/2015) and the The Express and The Star (22/9/2015). We have also written blogs for various popular online outlets, such as The Conversation (27/11/2015) under the title 'Thatcher helped people to buy their own homes - but the poorest paid the price' and Now Then Issue 95 (Feb 2016) 'Crime: Thatcherism and the '1980s crime wave'', http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/issue-95/crime/. 

One of the challenges which we faced is that with a historical project such as this and with no one government department with responsibility for crime and the criminal justice system, it is hard to have any impact in terms of policies. Our colleagues in the civil service are understandably simply too stretched to engage with a project about how crime rates were influenced by decisions 30 or 40 years ago.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4F271202-C64F-451B-8607-4D8558D57C9A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5619b55d1c5.03942607</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have discovered the following:

1: That the right to buy council homes stemming from the 1980 Housing Act redistributed domestic property crime from owners to those in the socially rented sector over the 15-10 years after 1980. 

2: That the increase in popular punitive sentiments was a key driver in the increase of incarceration rates. Thatcher responded to this shift in public opinion, becoming 'tough-minded' on crime from the late-1970s. Since the officially-recorded crime rate has come down, so punitiveness has declined.

3: Using insights from punctuated equilibrium theory and the ideas of moral panics and policy entrepreneurs, we have outlined how crime went from being a peripheral issue to a central policy concern following the murder of James Bulger, rises in school truanct rates, wider media attention to crime, parliamentary debates, popular concerns about young people's respect for 'traditional values', Michael Howard's appointment as Home Secretary and Tony Blair's 'tough on crime' approach. 

4: That Thatcher did (contray to previous studies) produce a rightwards shift in social attitudes and values, but that this only took root because Tony Blair's governments did not challenge these values. We have also charted a decline in political activisim amongst later geneations and shown that the anxieties about crime a generation holds are shaped by the political discourses around crime as they came of age (so one's fears are a product of past discourses rather than simply immediate crime rates). 

These results were only possible because we brought together into new datasets continuous runs of the British Social Attitudes ad British Crime Surveys. These new data sets (and additional macro-level data) have been deposited at the UK Data Archive for others to use. We have also run a training day on the datasets with ESDS in Manchester. 

Another major achievement was the commissioning of a film about Thatcherism and its effects on both British society and crime. Interviewees included Norman Tebbit, Michael Howard, David Blunkett, Douglas Hurd, and Baroness Ruth Lister. &amp;quot;Generation Right&amp;quot; (the name of the film, was produced by Medina Films and is 40mins long). It has been shown at various film festivals around the world and won Gold Award in the Documentary Short competition at the Oregon Film Awards (2015) and Silver Award in the Spotlight Documentary Film Awards (2015).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We planned to undertake five impact activites, but actually undertook slightly more than originally proposed:

One of planned activity was a seminar hosted by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies in London and chaited by David Walker of the Academy of Social Sciences. This event led to various articles in newspapers and radio interviews, and as such contributed to public awareness and debates about the legacy of Thatcherism. The film Generation Right served in a similar way, attracting reviews online and sparking debates after showings. Our training day for the datasets produced attracted users from both academia and parliament, and the datasets are available for anyone to use. Our email list of interested parties includes policy makers, people working political parties/pressure groups and private citizens who watched the film and wanted to find out more about the project. We also created a twitter account (Thatcher_Legacy, and which we hadn't proposed) which has over 1600 followers (many being private citizens) and wrote several blogs for popular online magazines (such as The Conversation). After film showings and publics talks we have collected data from the audiences on three issues (listed below):

The film [or talk] made me want to find out more about recent British political history. (67% agree or strongly agree).

The film [or talk] gave me a better understanding of some of the key issues discussed. (68% agree or strongly agree).

The film [or talk] has made me think about that period differently. (37% agree or strongly agree).
