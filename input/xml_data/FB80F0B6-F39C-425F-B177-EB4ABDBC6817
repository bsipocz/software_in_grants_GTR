This excited electronic state is called 'the exciton' and once it is produced in the antenna system of a photosynthetic organism, it is transferred between numerous chlorophyll molecules within the photosynthetic protein complexes. The exciton eventually ends up in the photosynthetic reaction centre (within about 0.000000000001 of a second, or 1 picosecond), where its energy is used to initiate chemical reactions that eventually lead to water splitting and carbon fixation. It is these reactions that ultimately give the plants, algae or bacteria the energy and food required to sustain them.

The emerging field of artificial photosynthesis seeks to engineer man made molecular devices that mimic natural photosynthetic systems. In doing this, scientists and engineers hope to address the world's energy concerns of the 21st century by employing devices that can harvest solar energy for the purpose of electricity and, perhaps more importantly, renewable biofuels that can be used in much the same way non-renewable fossil fuels are used. The field of artificial photosynthesis is multidisciplinary and involves collaborations between chemists, physicists, engineers, biologists, and other scientists and technologists. 

This project seeks to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of the fundamental process of exciton energy transfer (EET), the initial process of photosynthesis, through the development of new types of computer simulations. EET is the process in which photons, originating from the sun, are absorbed by a molecule giving rise to an electronic excited state within the molecule. This electronic excited state, called an exciton, is then transferred to another location within the molecule where this excess energy can be used to do work, generally in the form of driving a chemical reaction. Although scientists have a reasonable understanding of the EET process, there is still much that is not understood at the molecular level, which may have an impact the design principles of light harvesting materials and artificial photosynthetic devices. 

Recent experiments have opened up fundamental questions about the mechanism behind exciton energy transfer (EET) within the natural photosystems. In 2007 researchers at University of California, Berkeley, investigated one of the natural photosystems (the FMO protein) spectroscopically and observed long-lived quantum mechanical in biological systems, even at ambient temperatures. This was a great surprise because it was thought that biological systems were too 'large' and 'warm' for quantum mechanical effects to be present for long periods of time. The question of whether the observed effects are important in facilitating the EET processes is an open and controversial question one. Nevertheless, understanding whether these quantum effects are important in the EET process is vitally important in the race to develop fully optimised artificial photosystems that can be utilized for solar energy harvesting in practical devices that could be used to generate electricity and production of renewable fuels. 

This project involves the development of a mixed quantum/classical theoretical approach that will allow us to simulate EET processes in a variety of molecular systems on high performance parallel computers, similar to those used for weather forecasting. In this work, we will focus on simulating how electromagnetic radiation from the sun interacts with the exciton and how the movements of the molecule in turn affects the exciton's (quantum) evolution.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We envisage impact in several areas beyond the realm of physical sciences: 

(a) Training of the PDR (postdoctoral researcher) - economic and societal impact 

(b) Development of design tools for solar energy devices - economic and societal impact 

(c) Opening new avenues of investigation into renewable energy government policies - political impact 

This project fits into the academic discipline of theoretical and computational physical chemistry. Specifically it involves the development of a theoretical methodology that will be converted into open-access scientific software. The impact associated with this kind of fundamental research outside of the immediate subject area will, in-part, involve the contributions that training the PDR provides. The PDR will be trained to the highest level of practical problem solving using the multidisciplinary skills developed during this wide ranging research project. The project is cross-disciplinary in nature, combining aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science. The PDR will work on high performance clusters and will be encouraged to attend workshops as part of their training. Further, the PDR will learn how to present scientific data in a variety of media including peer reviewed journals and at international conference. The skills learnt by the PDR are highly transferable and would be most applicable in specialist industries where high performance computing is central, such as software engineering, predictive modelling and the financial sector. 

The software that will result from this research will be made open-access and enable any interested party to perform simulations of energy movement in molecules and materials, offering a new tool to help in the development of design principles for solar energy harvesting antennas. Such assemblies have a critical role as energy collectors (antennae) in many proposed solar energy conversion systems. They permit the efficient collection and transport of solar energy, usually to a centre for charge separation. The charge separated state acts like a molecular capacitor where the stored energy is be given up to generate electricity or initiate reactions such as water splitting (to form hydrogen) or carbon fixation (to result in the formation of carbon based fuel). In this way this project will play a significant role in the development of materials for exploitation of solar energy, an area of the widest imaginable impact. 

The importance of sustainable energy and climate change is obvious. Sunlight is by far the most abundant source of energy that the planet earth has available. To put this statement into perspective, the annual solar flux that the earth receives is in excess of 1024 Joules of energy. Wind produces approximately 1022 Joules, and tidal energy only 1019 Joules. The current global consumption is over 1020 Joules/year. The sun therefore supplies the earth with nearly 10,000 times more energy than is needed to sustain the current human population. However, tidal energy only produces one tenth of it. The 2007 White Paper &amp;quot;Meeting the Energy Challenge&amp;quot; by the Department of Trade and Industry states &amp;quot;Renewables are key to our strategy to tackle climate change and deploy cleaner sources of energy&amp;quot; (page 14). However the development of solar harvesting technologies hardly gets a mention in the report. The success of this sort of research is essential if scientists are going to be able to help direct politicians towards long term global energy solutions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98070</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>New software has been developed that has allowed us to gain insight into the role of electronic energy migration in condensed phase systems, and in particular in photosynthetic units.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These finding could have an impact on the development of synthetic energy harvesting materials.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>051DE889-C723-4F4C-B822-35B9D80D1BD9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54525cb04bc5d2.72324520</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C7A4BD8F-C924-4D0F-BE18-5D8D1499361A</gtr:id><gtr:title>A theoretical investigation into the effects of temperature on spatiotemporal dynamics of EET in the FMO complex.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The journal of physical chemistry.
