The project is a collaboration between the Fellowship PI, Kerrie Schaefer, and acta Community Theatre company, a key partner whose work was documented and analysed within the Fellowship research project, and whose professionally- and publically- oriented events provided pathways for impact. acta has secured part funding (from Arts Council England) for a National Festival of Community Theatre to be held in Bristol in June 2016. acta and Schaefer aim to collaborate on producing this event and a series of (three) critical dialogues leading into it. In particular, the critical dialogue series aims to build on acta's Foundation Worker scheme targeting emerging practitioners who might be graduating/recently graduated from University although lacking practical industry/work experience. The National Festival of Community Theatre will feature performances, workshops and critical dialogues covering research themes deemed most relevant to practice concerns by acta and Schaefer. There will be a high profile opening event to the Festival with over 100 people expected to attend including community theatre practitioners and companies from Europe and the UK, students and academics, and public and private commissioners of work. The seminars and Festival will be digitally documented and a documentary film will be made available on the acta website project page. 

These activities, building on established cross-sector networks and relationships, will benefit a great number of user groups, and, together with documentation of the project, will ensure longevity of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from the Follow-On project? 

There are several groups identified as potential beneficiaries from the engagement activities of the proposed project in the UK and internationally: 

1. Community Theatre practitioners - experienced and emerging (including trainees).

2. Public policy makers, especially those working in the areas of arts and culture, and community. 

3. The project partner, acta Community Theatre, and other community-based performance companies. 

4. Community theatre participants.

5. Members of the general public, in particular community groups or community activists.

How might they benefit?

Beneficiaries 1-5 will benefit from participation and engagement in the project activities: the seminar series and national conference. The benefits for each group are expressed in terms of the following impacts:

1. Experienced community theatre practitioners will benefit from demonstrating their work and engaging in dialogue with other practitioners (including emerging ones), researchers, public policy makers and the general public about underlying philosophies, rationales, working methods and processes. Practitioners will benefit from dialogic spaces created to develop even more sophisticated collective definitions of their professional practice that they can then utilise in research, policy and practice contexts to strengthen the impact of their work. Practitioners will benefit from new ways of critically explaining what they do, its relevance and value (beyond the intrinsic or instrumental, and not reduced to the economic) to society. Practitioners will benefit from the recognition of their professionalism and expertise and the establishment of stronger mixed professional networks and events for progressing UK practice. 
Emerging community theatre practitioners, trainees and HE students will benefit from engagement with experienced practitioners honestly and openly discussing and demonstrating their practice, including difficult and challenging elements of it. Students, in particular, will gain insight into some of the issues faced by practitioners in the industry. 

2. Public policy makers will gain deeper insight into how community theatre practitioners define their own practices - philosophically and pragmatically - and what, essentially, drives their work. Public policy makers will benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the difference between community theatre as static, social welfare and a dynamic, democratic performance process in which participants are able to imagine and enact alternative ways of being-together. Public policy makers will thus be better placed to understand how, why and when to integrate theatre and performance into public planning processes and the value that these practices will add to that process.

3. acta Community Theatre will benefit from an enhanced profile as co-producer and host of the seminar series and national conference. Acta and other community theatre organisations will gain increased knowledge of the broad spectrum of practice in the field and be able to establish stronger networks and relationships for supporting practice. The practice field will be able to explore the possibility of (re-)convening a regular national conference to increase future knowledge and understanding of community theatre and performance. 

4.Community theatre participants will benefit from engagement in professionally-oriented events in which there is space to voice their experience and demonstrate their social and cultural learning and expertise. There is great potential for participants to share knowledge, experience and expertise with members of the public who may be curious or committed to changing or celebrating their communities. 

5.The general public will benefit from increased understanding of community theatre practice and being better informed about participatory processes, including difficulties and challenges.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>acta foundation seminar: whose theatre is it anyway?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0830AA80-3928-4367-B954-62C3D331E3C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 50-60 people attended a seminar at acta community theatre, Bristol, on 29 January for an interactive conversation on the topic of ownership in theatre. 

With artistic facilitators and communities working together, who exactly are the experts, and how does individual and community ownership of theatre happen?

 What do we mean by ownership and why is it important in community theatre?
 How does the theatre facilitator work towards creating that, and do they control the means of production?
 What power relations exist between the participant and practitioner?
 Is there such a thing as collective ownership?
 Do processes always end with collective consensus?
 How does the practitioner facilitate ownership of a theatre piece by the people making it?

The seminar was chaired by Dr Kerrie Schaefer, and included presentations from Jonathan Petherbridge, Director of London Bubble, Common Wealth Theatre, acta participants and practitioners, and lots of opportunity to discuss/debate the issues with the speakers and seminar attendees.

The conversation was conducted interactively with presentations leading to discussions on tables feeding back to the floor.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6e2b0981577.84171997</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.acta-bristol.com/2016-seminars/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>acta Community Theatre seminar -</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C64DD6D-1A0A-4879-ABD8-D19E8590C244</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 50 people attended the seminar to discuss the politics of community theatre after short presentations by invited speakers, chaired by Schaefer.

 acta Foundation quarterly seminar series

Supported by AHRC and Arts Council England.

The first seminar, &amp;quot;The Politics of Community Theatre,&amp;quot; chaired by Dr Kerrie Schaefer, actacentre Studio, Friday 13 November, 1.30 - 4.30pm.

Then and Now - When acta started in 1985, it was Thatcher's Britain. Today in 2015, acta's work is thriving under another Conservative government. Over the last 30 years, communities across Bristol and beyond have created nearly 400 original theatre shows with acta. How much of this work has been a political response to the inequalities of our society, theatre and the arts? Is acta a political organisation?

The expert panel will include:-
Dr Jenny Hughes, University of Manchester
Neil Beddow, acta Artistic Director
Declan Mallon, Upstate Theatre Project (Ireland)
Francois Matarasso

Contemporary art-making blends with local, personal and popular heritage in a unique and unsentimental cocktail for the here and now. Under the guidance of artist Feidlim Cannon (Brokentalkers), seven performers develop a contemporary, living history exploring the social history of an Irish town through personal recollections of growing up and living there. The global and the local collide through the prism of favourite TV shows, cinema and song celebrating a peoples' history of themselves. The performance is a real, sometimes surreal, re-presentation of stories, memories and reminiscences. 

Critical Dialogue 1: The politics of community theatre.

We are prompted, in part, by the recent election of a Conservative government and the onward, unfettered march of austerity policies, inequality and precarity (with the ongoing dis-assemblage of social welfare systems) under a Cameron/Osborne government.

We are also prompted, in no small part, by acta's 30th birthday celebrations in 2015. Formed in 1985, acta's historical arc reaches back to a time when Conservatives were last in power. This gives us pause to wonder what we might learn from the study of community theatre practices that have weathered three decades of neo-liberal government. What are the core principles that have enabled acta and others to sustain a resilient praxis in and through turbulent times? Has the work shape shifted to fit political exigencies, has it been steadfastly guided by fixed or deep rooted political convictions, or is it the product of a more pragmatic dance encompassing different constituencies, (un)common partnerships, advocacy, activism, cultural democracy and theatrical innovation?

At the centre of our discussion is the meaning of the term &amp;quot;community.&amp;quot; Whilst the lack of a precise definition was perhaps not essential to the 1970s counter-cultural movement seeking to storm the citadels of high art and restore the means of cultural production to the many rather than the few, critics have pointed out that the lack of a coherent political agenda for community arts has led to the practice being perceived as &amp;quot;something with the status of ameliorative social work for what are pejoratively called disadvantaged groups&amp;quot; (Watt 1991: 56).

Subsequently, some (Kelly, 1984) have sought to ground the concept of community in a British socialist tradition of thought, articulating the dynamic process of (working) class formation and self-determination, and, as part of a collective known as &amp;quot;the Shelton Trust,&amp;quot; to define the core principle of cultural democracy, after Gramsci's critique of 'cultural hegemony' (1986).

Did these ideas stick 30 years ago, what remains of this political agenda today, and how useful is it to the development of community theatre practice in 2015? How do community theatre practitioners and participants today conceive of their theatrical labours? How do political and cultural concerns play out in the everyday practices of making community theatre - grant applications, fund raising, relationship building (with specific communities or audiences), partnership formation, performance methods, advocacy/activism, evaluation, and so on?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6e016274e51.69024122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>acta Community Theatre seminar: getting in on the act</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F082AA0-66D0-48DA-97BD-760DA1C5C186</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar - interactive workshops on 18 March, 2016 @ acta Centre

In a preview to our community theatre festival in June, and with community engaged work trending across the UK, we consider what can be learnt from community theatre? An opportunity to meet practitioners who work with communities, and talk about the key issues at the heart of participatory practice:

Do you wait for an invitation, or do you go and create one?
Are there any invitations you wouldn't accept?
What's the difference between artist/practitioner-led practice and practice that responds to people?
In this latest seminar, we respond to the enhanced interest in the work of the sector and the opportunities it offers. Following a fundamental shift in the Arts Council's approach to diversity, all national funded theatre programmes are working to be more reflective of the communities they serve. A chance for community theatre to share, discuss, learn, celebrate and inspire

 

Dr Kerrie Schaefer (University of Exeter) and an expert panel including:

Ruth Ben Tovim - Encounters, Totnes, Devon;
Graham Jeffery - Culture &amp;amp; Creativity Research Hub, School of Media, Culture and Society; University of the West of Scotland;
discuss the 'cultural politics' of community theatre; how is it 'community-engaged' or 'participatory' or 'socially-engaged' and how can we do more better?

What should we hold on to as the core practice of our sector?

Why do we choose to make community theatre, and how does our sector relate to the Arts Council's &amp;quot;creative case for diversity?&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6e47fbe14f3.80773472</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.acta-bristol.com/getting-in-on-the-act/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National Festival of Community Theatre</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA01E301-9FA2-44D0-99E6-737F3C9E3C01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>National festival of community theatre with some international involvement (from Ireland, Slovenia, The Netherlands)

Over 100 participants attended to share work in the field, to participate in performance-based workshops, watch performances, and to discuss theory and practice of community theatre.

The three seminar series became more and more interactive moving from definition/debate of what it is (in seminar one) to sharing tenants and practices of community theatre making (seminar two and three) with interested attendees (students, arts-based practitioners, government workers and so on). The seminars led to a festival of community theatre bringing together key community/socially-engaged theatre companies in the UK, as well as international practitioners, for three-four days of intensive sharing via showings, practical workshops, and discussions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>10E45A56-0228-47F2-8795-5533F28C1F85</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d629fccb41f9.20049404</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N001230/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB55E3F-FFEA-4BE8-9850-37FB373F4D31</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
