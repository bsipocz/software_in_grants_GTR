disabilities</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M001911/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Confidential Inquiry into premature deaths of people with intellectual disabilities in England (2010-2013) reviewed the deaths of all people with intellectual disabilities in five (former) Primary Care Trust areas in South West England. It reported that men with intellectual disabilities died 13 years sooner than men in the general population and women with intellectual disabilities died 20 years sooner than women in the general population. Almost a quarter (23%) of deaths of people with intellectual disabilities were under the age of 50, compared with just 9% in the general population (Heslop et al., 2013). 

The study highlighted the absence of national information about the age, gender and cause of death (mortality data) relating to people with intellectual disabilities, and that at present in England it is not possible to disaggregate national mortality data to look at information only relating to people with intellectual disabilities. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the extent of health inequalities faced by this population nationally, to monitor a reduction in premature deaths, or to understand where targeted resources could be most effective. 

Discussions with colleagues internationally have indicated that mortality data about people with intellectual disabilities is non-existent or patchy in many countries. As in England, identifying people with intellectual disabilities in national mortality data is rarely possible. 

The proposed seminar series will be led by the academic and practitioner (GP) leads of the Confidential Inquiry in England. It will bring together academics, policy-makers and practitioners from a range of countries to discuss and share experiences of measuring and comparing premature mortality of people with intellectual disabilities. The overall aim of the seminars is to ultimately contribute to the identification and reduction of premature mortality in people with intellectual disabilities. Its objectives are to agree internationally comparable information to be collected about the deaths of people with intellectual disabilities and to discuss with, and support, academics, policy-makers and practitioners to gather, analyse and compare their data, sufficient to allow the development of policies and practical strategies to address common concerns identified by the data.

The proposed seminar series will consist of nine key seminar events, supplemented with a dedicated webpage, twitter account and blogs. A mixed model of seminars is proposed, that combines interactive web conferences, online workshops and two face-to-face meetings. Given the range of international collaborators involved, this would make best use of the available resources to geographically dispersed attendees. Where possible, the face-to-face meetings will 'piggy back' with significant national or international conferences that academic researchers and practitioners would be most likely to be attending, and will be held in Australia (Year 2) and the UK (Year 3). In addition to these face-to-face meetings, interactive web conferences and/or online workshops will be held each year using Webex or Adobe Connect (or similar) supplemented with a conference call line to provide enhanced interactive capacity. 

The proposed seminar series has support from a range of international academics and practitioners (from 12 countries) who are working to enhance the collection and quality of mortality data about people with intellectual disabilities. The seminar series will strengthen links between UK and international researchers, support internationally comparative data about mortality of people with intellectual disabilities to be collected, and offer opportunities for collaborative papers about premature and avoidable deaths in this population and the development of potential strategies to address the issues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal for the seminar series has been led by an academic researchers and a medical practitioner (GP) with an emphasis on making an impact with the work.
Our ultimate aim is to reduce premature mortality in people with intellectual disabilities, so we would expect this population and their families to be the main indirect beneficiaries of the seminar series.
Direct beneficiaries of the seminar series will be 
1. Academic researchers measuring and comparing premature mortality of people with intellectual disabilities, and new researchers interested in this field of work
2. Policy-makers aiming to reduce health inequalities
3. Service managers and practitioners supporting people with intellectual disabilities
4. Charities and third sector organisations providing advocacy, information, advice or practical support for people with intellectual disabilities.

How will they benefit?
1. Academic researchers
It is vital that equivalent definitions and methods are used to collect internationally comparable data. This would include a clear definition of 'people with intellectual disabilities' and harmonious mortality data. Academic researchers will benefit from the seminar series by having a forum to discuss, share and explore cross-national issues in collecting and understanding internationally comparable mortality data. The seminar series would be particularly timely for academics from a range of European, North American and Australasian countries who are now starting to address gaps in mortality data both within and between countries. It would also provide an opportunity for junior researchers interested in this under-researched area to become engaged in exciting, collaborative work in the future.
2. Policy-makers aiming to reduce health inequalities
The seminar series will provide policy makers with an opportunity to debate their need for data with academic researchers to ensure that appropriate data is collected and translated into relevant information. Reducing differences in life expectancy, along with increased healthy life expectancy in the most vulnerable groups in society, are key objectives of the Public Health Outcomes Framework in England. Policy makers therefore require accurate intelligence to understand how health inequalities impact on the health of vulnerable groups, and what the particular national and local needs are in this regard.
3. Service managers and practitioners supporting people with intellectual disabilities
The Confidential Inquiry in England identified that many service managers and practitioners were unsurprised at the early deaths of people with intellectual disabilities. In general, they lacked knowledge about potential contributory factors to premature deaths and how they could effective ameliorate these. The seminar series could directly benefit service managers and practitioners by providing them with accurate information about premature and avoidable deaths of people with intellectual disabilities, and possible preventative measures that could be taken e.g the need for flu and pneumonia immunisations for people with intellectual disabilities at high risk of death from respiratory infection; or the need for appropriate fall prevention strategies to prevent deaths from accidents. In essence, service managers and practitioners would be helping to translate the mortality data into effective practice-related action to reduce premature deaths at the 'front line'.
4. Charities and third sector organisations 
Charities and third sector organisations perform an important advocacy and campaigning role for many people with intellectual disabilities. They will benefit from the seminar series by engaging in discussions about ways to reduce health inequalities in people with intellectual disabilities, that they can then use in campaigning and advocacy interventions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30463</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Massachusetts (UMass)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>University of Massachusetts Medical School</gtr:department><gtr:description>Special Edition of JARID journal about mortality of people with intellectual disabilities</gtr:description><gtr:id>EBB0482A-ABD1-4856-81D9-520CC693601E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Special Edition of JARID was published in August 2015.

As a group contributing to the seminar series, we have been exploring this issue, along with policy makers and practitioners. As an example, in the USA, information about potential excess mortality in relation to falls and aspiration pneumonia has led to targeted training and the development of guidelines for care workers about early warning signs and actions to be taken.

Over the previous year the work undertaken in England has contributed to the development of policy-related guidance about mortality of people with learning disabilities. Thsi has been enhanced by being able to draw on examples from other countries and collaborators in our seminar series meetings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D954E94C-77BF-449F-9BD4-7FDFD2DC3E12</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b8f932d35509.78450044</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have worked hard to understand international data about mortality of people with intellectual disabilities. 
The Leicestershire and Ireland register data suggest higher mortality rates than more recent England figures, as did those from the Massachusetts state monitoring system, which are contemporary. Finnish national figures and data from the two Canadian provinces gave lower rates than in England. A similar study of New South Wales gave substantially less complete identification of people with ID in those aged 70 or older so the lower standardised death rate produced is therefore probably not comparable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See the most recent paper by Glover et al. 2017.
