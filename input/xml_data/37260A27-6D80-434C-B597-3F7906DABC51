&lt;p>It includes the introduction of new production technologies, new organisational concepts in production such as group work or relocation of production. Also important is the question of how new products emerge from process and organisational innovation, such as product-related services.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is anticipated that the fellow will improve our understanding of the determinants, forms, and outcomes of process and organisational innovation in firms and in particular how this relates to other forms of innovation by strengthening the links between existing research activities and organisations in this field and in Europe. This will help to stimulate research that analyses the effects of process and organisational innovation on growth and employment creation. Data collection is carried out as a written survey at company level. The questions on innovation indicators were agreed upon in the European Manufacturing Survey consortium and are surveyed in all the participating countries. Additionally, some countries ask questions on specific topics. Results will lead to new insights that will aid policy formulation and more coherent innovation strategy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be novel in that it will have a study focus on both the importance and contribution of advanced manufacturing innovation to both the recovery as well as the rebalancing of the economy. It will investigate high capability and cutting edge management and leadership practice in leading manufacturing firms across Europe (including the UK, Germany, Spain and Austria). 

There is a unique interdisciplinary focus to the fellowship as it aims to bring together world leading academic mentors from technology and innovation, leadership and supply chains, with cutting edge engineering and manufacturing industrial firms, many of whom are world leaders in engineering innovation. 

It is anticipated that the research investigation will have a major policy impact on UK and European Industrial and Innovation Policy including the following issues:

1.Manufacturing of R &amp;amp; D offshoring activities and related opportunities and risks.
2.Technical and organizational process issues. 
3.Supply chain design. 
4.Value adding process improvement.
5.Leadership and strategy development. 
6.Shifting modes of production. 
7.Future of the European technological base.
8.Trainings and education provision. 
9.Mapping of capabilities and competencies. 
10.Social and flexible network design.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68790</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Fraunhofer Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>EMS</gtr:description><gtr:id>C89A2BAE-59CA-4C7D-B9E6-A1D49B302454</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is multi-disciplinary, connecting the social sciences with technology (engineering and science) on the innovation front.
Outcomes are under production, as most of the efforts so far has been put into setting up the data collection phase.

We in collaboration with those institutes designed a core questionnaire to capture innovation activities of all kinds (process, product, organization) in the manufacturing sector. We act as the UK arm and sent this survey out in UK in 2012 and collected the results.
