However, the main barriers holding back the widespread use of robotics and autonomous systems can be seen as societal: what should the legal framework be for such systems; how can the public come to trust these systems; how can we ensure they are safe; and how do we know such a system will make the decisions we would expect of it? All these are currently impossible to solve with any certainty.

The UK has numerous key research developments concerning the Verification and Validation (V&amp;amp;V) of autonomous systems that can all impact upon this problem. These are clearly of relevance to methods for designing, constructing and deploying autonomous systems but also have importance to Psychology (e.g. social robotics), Philosophy (e.g. machine ethics), and Law (e.g. certification). Constructing autonomous systems without behaviour guarantees can lead to serious outcomes, and may consequently hold back the widespread adoption of these systems. 

This Network will coalesce this activity, drive the research agenda forward, and embed the necessity for V&amp;amp;V firmly within industry, the government, and the public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We aim to engage closely with governmental agencies, professional societies, European and international institutions to contribute to the public debate on issues influenced by the Verification and Validation (V&amp;amp;V) of Autonomous Systems, leveraging and deepening our existing memberships and influence in such bodies. 

Many of the academics involved in the Network, together with their respective universities, have effective mechanisms for dealing with the media, with access to press offices who regularly publicise work nationally and internationally to non-academic audiences. We have already seen how autonomous systems (typically, Robotics) can spark the public's imagination. We will build on this, expand to other forms of autonomous systems (UAVs and driverless cars are natural possibilities), and target public awareness and communication. This is particularly important since V&amp;amp;V provides a viable route towards increased safety, reliability, and public trust.

Our aim, particularly through our Stake-holder Workshops is to engage with a broad range of industries. Although these will initially comprise companies interested in safety, reliability and certification of autonomous systems, we intend to ensure that the message concerning V&amp;amp;V, will be spread and so will aim for publicity across our industrial networks. The Network Portal that will be produced is also important for increased awareness, and showcasing case studies and best practice. It details academic groups within the Network, links to key/new research, case studies in V&amp;amp;V, descriptions of broader application of V&amp;amp;V techniques, material for publicity and opportunities for engagement, and further links to industrial activities. The Portal, together with the Stake-holder Workshops, will provide a focus for material and activity in this area, and will spur further industrial and publicity activities. Finally, we will engage with industrial participants, particularly at these workshops, in order to explore appropriate mechanisms for industrial V&amp;amp;V, ways to stimulate industrial take-up, and sustainable models for the future of the Network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>107724</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Verification and Validation of Autonomous Road Vehicles</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07202DC9-4F18-4C2E-8283-55C366D7908E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-organised with the UK Government's Centre for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) we held a one-day workshop in November 2016 in London, bringing together experts on regulations and standards relating to autonomous road vehicles with those developing verification and validation techniques.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beaf027a0396.85828927</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://vavas.org/events/verification-and-validation-for-autonomous-road-vehicles</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Industrial Perspectives on the V&amp;V of Autonomous Systems</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD2755FF-BC46-491D-8C57-642FB7376945</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop on &amp;quot;Industrial Perspectives on the V&amp;amp;V of Autonomous Systems&amp;quot; held in Sheffield in July 2016, and jointly organised with Innovate UK.
