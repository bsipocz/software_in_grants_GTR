My research will be aimed at revealing the role that knowledge has to play in an account of human agency. Usually a philosophical story about human agency is cast in terms of BELIEF: I shall argue that philosophers have underestimated the role of KNOWLEDGE in action. It is distinctive of human beings to act for reasons; and the idea of a REASON FOR ACTING is widely thought to be definitive of human agency. (We give our reasons for acting in a certain way when we say WHY we acted in that way.) This idea of a reason crops up both in ethics, and in philosophy of mind. Philosophers in these two areas have worked with different conceptions of a reason for acting. In ethics, questions of evaluation are to the fore, and reasons are taken to be considerations that justify acting in a particular way--sometimes called 'actual reasons'. In philosophy of mind, reasons are taken to be psychological states (specifically beliefs and desires) that are causally relevant to an agent's acting as they do. Philosophers who notice the two different conceptions of reasons react in opposed ways. Some prioritise actual reasons, and point out that these are not psychological states. Others prioritise psychological states, and acknowledge that these are not actual reasons. It can then seem as if we had to make a choice: we can EITHER say that people often act for actual reasons OR say that actions are causally explained when agents' reasons are given. But nearly everyone wants to say BOTH of these things. We evidently need a new way to think about reasons of the two sorts. The key, I believe, is to introduce KNOWLEDGE OF REASONS. One is then in a position to appreciate the claim that actual reasons coincide with reasons in the sense of psychological states: there is such a coincidence precisely in the case in which an agent does something KNOWING the reason to do it. In that case, the notions of causation and justification are seen to come together. So I claim. In the work I propose, I shall elaborate on this claim. And I shall explore the consequences of crediting knowledge a central role in an account of agency. In doing so, I shall cast light on a number of areas of philosophical enquiry. A. According to the doctrine of ethical non-cognitivism, ethical sentences are not in the business of being either true or false, so cannot give the contents of people's beliefs. There is a new route into a debate about such a doctrine when knowledge, of various kinds, is seen to play a role in the genesis of action.B. When knowledge is seen to play this role, some new considerations can be brought to bear on a debate in philosophy of mind about the place of states of mind in the causal world.C. When the fact that agents are knowledgeable is brought to bear, there is also a new way to think about various conceptions of what an agent is able to do. And one can enquire which of these conceptions is relevant to a certain debate about freedom of action. D. There is a special sort of agents' knowledge which is contemporaneous with acting: someone who is in the process of acting for a reason can know what she is doing without making use of the observation-based knowledge that a spectator has. Such agents' knowledge needs to be understood in connection with knowledge of reasons. And such knowledge needs to be brought into play in recent debates about self-knowledge (people's knowledge of themselves), and about how self-knowledge relates to knowledge of the world. In sum: I shall reveal the pervasive role that knowledge has to play in an account of human agency. And I shall show in my work that a number of philosophical debates are profitably advanced when its role is taken into account.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-12-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-08-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28880</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D000165/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C3FAF999-8402-446C-8A80-016962744E22</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epistemology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D3297D2-A1F7-4EE8-A676-CD04BB9D7689</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metaphysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>143EF6F8-CF59-4D04-9EA7-40D70FC41177</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Mind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
