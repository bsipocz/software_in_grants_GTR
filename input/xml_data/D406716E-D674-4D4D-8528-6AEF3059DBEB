England Regional Centre for exploring the FWW spans Suffolk, Essex, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire. It will mark the centenary of the FWW through collaborative histories, creative performance, source exploration, practical experiment and digital sharing. We aim to connect academic and local experience, and to build productive community engagement and research partnerships with the capacity to stretch and even surprise all involved.

In developing objectives and a programme of activities for the Centre, the team worked through the University of Hertfordshire's Heritage Hub to consult heritage and arts organisations, history groups and community associations in the region. Reflecting on this process, we selected themes that will bring new angles to familiar stories and inspire an extensive programme of community engagement at regional and (inter)national levels: food; theatre; military tribunals; learning disability; supernatural beliefs; military intelligence; childhood:
* FWW food production, supply and consumption highlight international and local economies, creating a powerful tool in exploring memory, scale and present-day relevance.
* FWW theatre offers participants another experiential route into a past more commonly shaped by war poetry.
* Military tribunals link national institutions of war with individual lives on the Home Front; as conscientious objection (CO) emerges as an 'alternative' perspective to trenches, tribunals put CO in broader context. Reconstructing their proceedings has considerable research and engagement potential.
* The theme of learning disabilities draws on Hertfordshire's distinctive institutional history of asylums and challenges us to think broadly about communities.
* Beliefs in ghosts, angels, mediums and fortune-tellers provide important insights into the lasting psychological impact of disorientation, fear and huge loss of life.
* Academically FWW intelligence is an under-researched area but, because of the resonance of intelligence in popular culture, it is one that is likely to stimulate community interest.
* The impact of the FWW on those born since 1919 allows the Centre to address inter-generational relationships and re-think the meanings of 'legacy'.

Geographical communities are significant to the Centre, but so is the inclusion of communities of interest, belief, practice, circumstance or experience. Through co-produced research, the Centre will develop intellectual and cultural contexts to enrich historical understanding of the FWW. It aims that by 2016 community organisations that have already embarked on research (with or without HLF funding) will have incorporated at least one new question or perspective; that people living in the region who have not yet thought about the centenary will have contributed to it; that the regional dimensions of the conflict will have come into focus; and that audiences and topics of research will have diversified. Micro-histories, documents and artefacts will emerge from local projects to benefit researchers across the board. The Centre will maximize these effects by connecting discrete projects through face-to-face events and digital communities. It will manifest the sheer variety of FWW heritage in Britain today and record it for the longer term.

The centenary of the FWW is an opportunity to probe in innovative ways the historical significance of a period which resonates strongly in contemporary Britain. Looking forward from 2013, the precise form of centenary activities, the relationship between academic and public histories, and the influence of the state and other bodies in shaping memorialisation, are still uncertain. A conjunction of meticulous research, living tradition and multiple end uses, is creating a situation that is itself a fascinating subject for analysis and an occasion for profound dialogue about the nature of scholarship and heritage in 21st-century Britain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>New knowledge and skills will have an immediate impact on the FWW centenary and those involved with it. Transferable skills, capacity building and networks will have longer-term relevance. Case studies will contribute to understanding of a wide-range of community contexts.

*Individuals and community groups in the region. HOW: new transferable skills and confidence building gained through formal training, informal activities, and through the inclusive strategies that give participants a voice in the Centre; structured knowledge exchange facilitated by the Centre's FWW Historypin site and co-produced research. Practical project experience, including appropriate ethical practice. A broader historical context through which to engage with centenary activities; new understandings of the FWW and its complex legacies in the communities and families to which they belong; opportunities for inter-generational dialogue.
* Individuals and community groups, national and international. HOW: skills and new knowledge about the FWW gained via online access to activities and expertise; a sense of inter-connectedness through the processes of remembering the FWW and its legacies; town twinning as a vehicle for face-to-face international community engagement.
*Communities frequently marginalised in heritage initiatives: learning disability communities and migrant workers. HOW: through knowledge of their own heritage and place in history; confidence building achieved through activities that value their experiences and expertise; new skills and networks of shared interest generated by participation in the Centre. Ethical engagement with topics of relevance to their lives.
*Heritage and cultural organisations in the region e.g. museums, arts organisations. HOW: forging new networks that cross county boundaries; opportunities to share expertise, archives and other resources with similar organisations; potential for working with volunteers and communities not previously known to them. New knowledge about the FWW for professional staff; and a forum for raising awareness about their own FWW programmes.
*National non-government groups. HOW: synergies between the Centre's research and outreach programme and their own FWW activities; knowledge, skills and resources exchange.
*Government bodies, local and regional. HOW: scope for meeting core policy objectives of social inclusion, widening participation and community cohesion through a sense of shared heritage. New knowledge about what is distinctive about their locality; opportunities to be 'on the map'.
*Schools involved in the programme and indirectly through best practice. HOW: staff involvement in co-produced research as a form of CPD; formal learning for students via curriculum materials and 'myth-busting' case studies; stronger links between schools and HEIs in their region; opportunities for school students to develop transferable skills through participation in a wide range of FWW activities relevant across the curriculum, including performance, oral interviewing, creative writing, digital co-production. New knowledge for students to ground the FWW in their own localities and families; a voice for young people in thinking about present and future legacies of the FWW.
* HEIs. HOW: sharing experience in community group heritage management and co-production of research.
* Tourism and other commercial ventures. HOW: new, accessible, historically-accurate material on the FWW, particularly its regional impact. Whether their own story or a more generic one, heritage is a powerful resource for businesses in marketing, staff engagement or business strategy.
* Policy makers. HOW: dialogue with communities; case studies on the nature of communities, active participation and social empowerment; insights into the legacies of the FWW and their implications for future policies, e.g. to re-engage with pressing contemporary issues, such as climate change, global insecurity, intelligence gathering.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>609301</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>English Heritage</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>English Heritage Trust (Sharp collaborative project)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B173A94-9A91-48FC-9083-44C6101D40A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As reported in Researchfish (Engagement Activities):

Social Attitudes to Conscientious Objection' was a collaborative project funded by the Everyday Lives in War Centre, led by Dr Ingrid Sharp, University of Leeds.

This work fed into a HLF bid by English Heritage 'Richmond Castle Cells: Voices of Rebellion' (HG-13-12605) centred on the history of those FWW conscientious objectors held in the cells. Some of these COs, known as the Richmond 16, are well-known figures and have been the subject of popular and academic studies. 

A less well-known history is how the Richmond community responded to these prisoners and their stance and this project brought together academics, students and community groups in order to find this out: community volunteers in Richmond will undertake the local aspects of the research using site-specific materials while Leeds University research interns will explore social attitudes to COs as reflected in national newspapers, memoirs, diaries and letters held in the Liddle Collection at Leeds. This collaboration will lead to co-produced outputs on social attitudes to COs and their support networks at a national and local level, specifically those held in Richmond Castle in 1916. 

Academic partners provided training in archival and media research as well as essential background knowledge to the topic. The project leader offered advice and guidance when required.

Postgraduate and undergraduate interns at the University of Leeds conducted research into social attitudes to COs using materials held in the Liddle collection as well as conducting an extensive literature review of existing scholarship.

Academic partners also facilitated a panel of leading experts (Lois BIbbings, Cyril Pearce, Clive Barrett, David Boulton, Julian Putkowski, Nick Hiley and Chloe Waters) to discuss their research into COs and invited community research partners to attend the CO event at the Resistance to War conference in March 2016 and the Peace History Conference in October 2016.

The announcement of the 'discovery' of the survival of the Mid-Staffs Military Service Appeals Tribunal papers made the breakfast news headlines on 13 August 2014 with further items on the Today programme and BBC 1 Lunchtime News. This prompted an extraordinary public response: over 100 people (rather than the anticipated 11) volunteered to help index and digitise the papers at Staffordshire Record Office (SRO). SRO had successfully bid for an HLF award to open up access to these papers, but had not anticipated such a significant response. With guidance from Professor Karen Hunt (Keele), who had provided academic support for the original HLF bid, the project was widened to pursue what the Tribunals could reveal about everyday life on the Staffordshire home front. A wide range of local sources are now being searched not only to index all those whose cases appeared before the Appeals Tribunal but also to explore what the Tribunal papers reveal about everyday life on the Staffordshire home front. This has meant understanding more about the changing nature of daily life on the home front that the Tribunals were a part. Volunteers extended their collection of evidence to include local newspapers, school log books, local authority records, and local solicitors papers (who gave support to individual Tribunal cases). The issue now is how best to handle the much wider range and volume of data in ways that the original HLF project was not designed for: its principal purpose is to index and digitise the tribunal papers.

This research project, 'The Mid Staffordshire Appeals Tribunal: a window onto everyday life on the Staffordshire home front', was a response to these new circumstances. It was the means to explore how best to analyse this wide range of new material to reveal how a particular home front was experienced in everyday life and how it changed over the duration of the Great War. The project brought together an experienced historian (one of the advisers to the AHRC/BBC 'WW1 At Home' project) with the volunteers organised through SRO to produce a different kind of history. By focusing on everyday life on the WW1 home front, the project demonstrated the ways in which neglected sources such as the tribunal papers can be used by the public and academic researchers to create new narratives of WW1. However, it is not just the sources that are distinctive, so are the methods as the project aims to co-produce knowledge from a large amount of un-sifted data from a wide range of different kinds of sources. 

Professor Hunt worked with the SRO Staffordshire Appeals project volunteers to put together a picture of everyday life on the Staffordshire home front. Together they asked how distinctive this home front was and identified some of the ways in which Staffordshire people responded to the demands of a 'total war' as it increasingly encroached on their daily lives.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Manchester City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Henry Watson Library, Manchester (Kelly collaborative project)</gtr:description><gtr:id>B401C135-7512-4E11-97D2-62F6985C5D5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As reported in Researchfish (Engagement Activities):

This project is designed to focus on the over-arching theme of farming, fishing, food supply and agrarian industries of the rural county of Devon during the First World War. It has three key objectives: 1) to examine rural life during the latter part of the conflict from 1916, as food shortages worsened because of the submarine blockade, and conscription and government intervention affected the rural and maritime workforces; 2) to bring together a broad range of local and community history groups to research common themes, share findings and exchange ideas about sources, methods and results; 3) in association with Devon History Society to produce project outputs such as a conference, publications and create a lasting research infrastructure in Devon, with an organisational template and networks between groups that future collaborative research projects can develop. 

'Farming, Fishing and Food Supply' builds upon a variety of existing community projects, including the Lustleigh Society, incorporated in Dartmoor Trust Museum's exhibition at Princetown (Apr.-Sept. 2015), Wembury Local History Group's exhibition on farming in FWW (Nov. 2014), Devon Garden History Forum on allotments and market gardening, Brixham Museum's research on fishing and Poltimore Estate Research Society on residents of the Poltimore estate and participation in WW1, as well as activities initiated since March 2013 by Devon County Council's Devon Remembers initiative (http://www.devonremembers.info/).

Drawing on this expertise (and on interests within Devon History Society's 63 affiliated local societies), this project allows local researchers to identify and collaborate on a series of research themes, hold project workshops to share skills, knowledge and findings, and (through DHS) organise a conference exhibition, in which participants can discuss these themes and produce a variety of outputs and future publications (information packs for schools, posters, exhibitions, leaflets, web content, articles/themed issue for The Devon Historian).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Age Exchange</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Age Exchange (Roper collaborative project)</gtr:description><gtr:id>C6159CE3-5ED9-4C9A-BF2E-CCCDDDA44AD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reported on Researchfish (Engagement Activities):

The heritage activities of 'Meeting in No Man's Land' - particularly the exchange between British and German elders - allowed the researchers to chart shifts in historical consciousness as they occur among the participants, and to demonstrate the broader significance of family histories in the centenary.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>'&amp;quot;Meeting in No Man's Land&amp;quot;: German &amp;amp; British descendants share heritage of the Great War': was a collaborative project funded by the Everyday Lives in War Centre, led by Prof Mike Roper &amp;amp; Dr Rachel Duffett, University of Essex.

Age Exchange, the lead partner, obtained HLF funding for its part of the project in early December 2015. Roper and Duffett's role - was twofold. Firstly, they strengthened the methodological and historical grounding of the project. Roper's background in psycho-social methods and inter-generational legacies was drawn on in order to construct the methodology for the gathering of family heritage, identifying themes and schedules for interviews and developing understandings of the psychological significance of family artefacts. In addition, Roper and Duffett's understanding of the different historical legacies in each country - such as the effects of defeat and victory, and the overlay of the Second World War on memories of the First - helped provide a context for the emerging cross-national comparisons. In this way, the research potential of the project was maximised. 

As well as contributing knowledge to the project, Roper and Duffett's own research benefited from the collaboration. Whilst in Germany Roper consulted with experts in intergenerational therapies associated with the German partner organisations. The direct personal experience of comparative research sharpened their understanding of what is distinctive, or not, about British family legacies of the conflict. This has had an impact on their ongoing research on interwar family legacies in Britain, and specifically Roper's monograph, The Generation Between: childhood, play and the legacies of the Great War, currently in preparation. 

In addition to their inputs to the Steering Group, the January preparatory visit and the interviews and exchange in April, Roper and Duffett kept a diary of their observations. This was published in blog form through the Everyday Lives in War website. They also conducted subsidiary interviews with participants, aimed at establishing how involvement in the project has changed their perception of the First World War and their own family's history. This material, along with the interviews and digitised family objects, will form the basis of an article which evaluates the project's contribution to WW1 heritage in the centenary of the conflict.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Military Intelligence Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Military Intelligence Museum (Beach collaborative project)</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D5ABDF6-02F3-413C-9C7B-FBB4AD5B9444</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project is due to finish in December 2017, The following outputs are already reported on Researchfish (Engagement Activities):

B. Identification of Intelligence Corps materials.* Intelligence Corps materials are held by other archives, but the museum has no record of their content or location. Online finding aids and resources such as searchable newspapers will also open up fresh opportunities to pursue private papers. Collaterally, the museum will probably identify non-First World War materials for other projects.

D. Review previous acquisition process.* In the 1960s the museum corresponded with veterans following newspaper appeals. It is hoped that a comprehensive trawl will identify useful snippets in the letters and the existence of papers/artefacts that were not deposited.

E. Acquiring fresh information.* This fresh appeal will replicate the 1960s process but using social media to reach out, in the first instance, to the genealogy community. The assumption is that family historians with an ancestor's connection to the Intelligence Corps will happily trade their information for context, involvement, and acknowledgement. The museum's normal accession protocols will be followed.

H. Curation.* The project should generate fresh material for the museum's displays. The lead applicant will also continue his previous curation support work.

I. Personnel database.* During the research a large number of Intelligence Corps individuals will be identified. This data will be recorded to allow the museum to better assist with future family history enquiries. It is hoped that, in due course, the database can be made available on their website as part of the virtual museum initiative.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>'Secret Soldiers: The Intelligence Corps in the First World War': a collaborative project funded by the Everyday Lives in War Centre, led by Dr Jim Beach, University of Northampton.

The project has 10 workstreams, five of which are led by the academic partner:

A. Intelligence 'B' Association. The museum holds an interwar membership list of an old comrades association for counter-espionage personnel. The lead applicant found an earlier version in another archive. Using online genealogical resources, a prosopographical study will be conducted.

C. Collection of Intelligence Corps materials. The targeting process will likely identify materials in standard UK military archives (National Archives, Imperial War Museum, National Army Museum). Many of these are in London, so budgeting has assumed short research trips for one or two people. The location of any fresh papers is unpredictable but museum friends living closer to distant archives may be able to assist in the collection.

F. Workshop. To be held at the University of Northampton on a Saturday in November/December 2017. The primary activity will be the volunteers talking about their processes, highlighting key discoveries, and lessons learned for their future work. This will be complemented by invited speakers talking about other aspects of British intelligence in the First World War. As well as the museum's community, it is hoped that the workshop will appeal to a wider audience and advertising will target groups such as the Western Front Association.

G. Writing &amp;amp; publishing. The aim is to submit the article to a journal around Easter, with the bulk of the book being written over the summer. The article has been front-loaded so that it can become an 'early win' and a pilot for later processes and data-management.

J. Evaluation. It is hoped that the project will provide useful lessons on co-production. Therefore data will be gathered for analysis and subsequent dissemination.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Woodbrooke</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Britain Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers): Muers collaborative project</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF1CDAF2-FE87-4BEA-8253-69C45E211CB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As reported on Researchfish (Engagement Activities):

This was a good opportunity to showcase the work of the Centre and also to cover some of the less well-known stories from the FWW and stimulate new research. The Q&amp;amp;A session was particularly valuable as it allowed people to share their own local experiences and to compare with other parts of the county and the wider nation. 

A number of people said they would take ideas back to their communities for further research. The day event also offered the opportunity for further one to one conversations around sources, questions and the current research climate. 

As a result of this day, Dr Moore conceived the idea of a new project into 'Anonymous Women' -- those women who are generally lost to the records but who were doing some of the basic work that kept communities going during the FWW. In addition, Dr Moore was able to introduce members of the St. Albans: Life on the Home Front Project group to the organiser of the HALH 2017 Symposium which will be on the theme of 'Women of Hertfordshire'; they have now agreed to give a talk on the women of St. Albans in the FWW at this event.

Some notable outcomes and impacts resulting from this activity include:
1. a new project which looks at 'Anonymous Women' and which will seek to connect local projects, including completed HLF projects, around this theme.
2. facilitating an opportunity for members of the St. Albans project to share their work with a wider audience</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b3069e39e3b8.71523777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.halh.org.uk/symposium.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>People's History Museum study day, Manchester, 2015 and aftermath (Ex-service organisations)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19519A84-6F5E-4CA3-AEF0-D2061C1C685F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This study day on 'Ex-Service organisations in the Great War and its aftermath' was the final event of the People's History Museum's FWW exhibition, Land Fit for Heroes, supported by funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund http://www.phm.org.uk/whatson/a-land-fit-for-heroes-war-and-the-working-class-1914-1918/ and advised by the CI and David Swift (UCLan), AHRC CDA student see http://beyondthetrenches.co.uk/tag/exhibition/

Each visit was followed by an event held for parents, teachers and children which included examples of work prepared by the children and a talk from Dr Moore on researching local and family stories.

The children were really enthused by their particular themes and produced some great work. They also had a lot of questions which were thought provoking including one child who asked 'How do you know when you have won the war?'

Feedback from one teacher was: 'I just wanted to pass on a huge thanks on behalf of our staff team to yourself for the session held this afternoon. It was great to see the children so engaged in the subject and to share the project with parents'.

Children were really enthusiastic. Working with the Whitfields, who are experienced in delivering education through drama, was enriching for both Dr Moore and the children. In addition to the impact noted below, is therefore the reciprocal learning experience for both the presenter (Dr Moore), the teachers, and the children.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b2f359758d76.91948921</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://watheatre.co/rainbow-forge-primary-school.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition: After Tipperary.

It was on public display. The main purpose of this activity was to share information and to stimulate thinking.

The exhibition Shakespeare and the First World War showed some of the ways in which Shakespeare and his plays were used to boost morale between 1914 and 1918.
The exhibition used rare photographs and documents to tell a variety of wartime stories. These ranged in location from King Edward VI School in Stratford-upon-Avon, whose pupils put on a swashbuckling production of Henry V, to Hollywood where D.W. Griffith produced a lavish version of Macbeth, to Ruhleben prisoner of war camp in Germany where inmates staged The Merry Wives of Windsor because it reminded them of home. The planning and research It involved representatives from the Shakespeare Institute, the Cadbury Research Library and King Edward IV School.

Audience feedback reported that the exhibition raised awareness about a forgotten aspect of WW1. The story of King Edward IV's school pupils who enlisted in 1914 was commented on as being powerful and moving.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ad958f244b88.89115210</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advice to the People's History Museum, Manchester, on Irish Citizens Army uniform being conserved for the Irish Labour History Museum, February 2016 (report by Nick Mansfield)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0397DA9D-DFCB-4520-8286-0E7A519E7168</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Nick Mansfield provided advice to the People's History Museum, Manchester, on Irish Citizens Army uniform being conserved for the Irish Labour History Museum, being displayed the Irish commemoration of the Easter Rising centenary.

A general invitation was circulated around community groups within moderate travelling distance of Hatfield, and the roadshow was advertised on the centre's website as an opportunity to discover more about photos, artefacts or memorabilia that people might have from the First World War or the years immediately following it.

Experts in a range of First World War related topics were on hand to give their insights into what such objects can reveal about experiences during the war and its aftermath. The experts also contributed 9 table-top displays of FWW material. Participants were able to browse objects brought along on the day, and talk to experts on a one-to-one basis. Around 40 people attended from Hertfordshire and adjoining counties with a range of artefacts, including a pair of candlesticks, a watercolour picture, medals, photographs and albums.

The event was a networking opportunity for the experts involved (Centre academics; Western Front Association; National Army Museum; the HLF-funded project Herts at War; Imperial War Museum; RAF Museum Hendon; Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies; Hertfordshire Scouts; IWM; plus an independent researcher into FWW airfields). All of these individuals or the organisations they represented have subsequently been involved in Centre activities (e.g. the county scouting archivist featured on a digital postcard made by the centre https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=1009#more-1009). Researchers discovered new material. Members of the general public learned from one another and from the table-top displays; those new to the Centre joined the mailing list. 

Experience from this first roadshow also informed planning for the second roadshow at Bletchley Park in September 2015 (taking the roadshow off-campus; including a 3-D scanner).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9e38deef5c4.31850880</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=135</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog piece for the AHRC's 'Beyond the Trenches' (reported by Rachel Duffett)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2D9BC38-9576-4411-ACC3-38B4D389AE4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Rachel Duffett prepared a piece requested as part of the Somme centenary activities - an opportunity to consider the battle from a different perspective.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6f79955e376.55435553</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://beyondthetrenches.co.uk/the-stomach-for-fighting-food-on-the-somme/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Everyday Lives in War Centre Website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A1692CB-D57D-401B-A7E1-AA016581BEAC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Centre website, providing introductory articles on research themes, blogs, information on events, guide to resources.

5 volunteers on the project gave confident and engaging individual presentations about research they had undertaken for the project. There were also comparative contributions reflecting on what could be learnt from surviving papers from other Tribunals and from similar community projects. Scholars of the home front from postgraduates to Prof Adrian Gregory also presented their reflections on the value of making these papers accessible, while Prof Hunt's presentation showed how the Staffordshire Appeals papers could be used to reveal new stories of everyday life on the home front and so challenge the traditional narrative of the war. 

An exhibition produced by the Staffordshire Appeals project was also displayed to the public for the first time - it has been displayed at libraries across the county ever since. 

The day before Prof Hunt spoke at the launch of the Appeals Project exhibition 'Gone' at County Hall to an audience of local politicians, archivists from across the region and from TNA, as well as volunteers from the project. Prof Hunt's contribution explained the genesis of the project, underlining its distinctiveness and significance.

Geographical reach was principally West Midlands, but some had come further, eg from Northampton. The audience included workers and volunteers from local museums, archives and community groups.

The event allowed the volunteers to come together and to really appreciate one another's research, and many commented on the value of the project as a whole. One volunteer was subsequently interviewed on local radio about her experience on the project. Links between academics and community historians and volunteers were forged and reinforced.

The event underlined the value of links between community projects and academic historians, particularly through shared recognition that reading against the grain in apparently unpromising sources can provide a vivid sense of the range of experiences on the home front, and can lead to fresh histories anchored in specific localities which can provide the basis for new narratives of the apparently familiar.

Dr Roper provided transcripts from some of his interviews with the (elderly) children of veterans, and these were used by Essex University playwright Annecy Lax as the basis for a piece of theatre using a company of students and a professional director. The two performances attracted good audiences and the subsequent Q &amp;amp; A sessions were lively and engaged.

N.B. The work was funded by an HLF grant. Dr Duffett worked with Barbara Pierson, the theatre's artistic director, to scope and write the application. 

This was an innovative event which explored the legacy of WW1 in a completely new way. It provided new insights into the testimony as well as being a very moving piece of theatre and it was evident from the audiences' responses in the Q&amp;amp;As that many had been touched profoundly by the experience.

Through the three workshops, a group of 15-20 community volunteers have identified a number of research projects which they will undertake, with their local history groups. The most advanced of these projects is a survey of the Annual Returns of Agricultural Statistics for the County of Devon, between 1912 and 1920. These have been identified as a means of establishing the effect of the war on farm production across the county, and a means to compare particular parishes with a more general 'county-wide' perspective. Henry French and James Wallis gathered digital photos of the Agricultural Returns in December directly from the National Archives (TNA), which volunteer groups have been analysing for sample parishes in the county. The first results of this research were reported at the February meeting, and we anticipate more detailed research conclusions will be reached by the next meeting in April. We are also now in the planning phase for delivering some of our targeted outputs scheduled for the autumn. 

At each project workshop we have also had a keynote talk by an expert on farming in the First World War. These have included Dr Paul Brassley on changing agricultural production and the role of government, and Dr Nicola Verdon on the role of the Women's War Agricultural Committees. These talks have provided information on relevant subjects to the volunteer group, and have been very useful in illustrating how to undertake research tasks, and which sources are useful. 

Time was recently spent time developing the project's recent online presence on the Hub's website with blog entries from volunteers. We are also continuing to provide a stream of varied data sets to work on (including recently catalogued material from the Devon Rural Archive at Modbury) as well as additional material from TNA and the House of Commons Research Papers. Furthermore we have scheduled meetings to progress the fishing strand, working in collaboration with community historians from Brixham, Sidmouth and the Teign Heritage Centre. 

The next three topics for groups to research are:
a) Allotments - These have the potential to involve research by groups in urban as well as rural locations.
b) Food - Dr Paul Cleave will give a talk at the next meeting about the study of food, food history, food supply and food substitutes during the FWW.
c) Fishing - Liaising with the Devon Heritage Centre's 'Devon Remembers' Project Officer, Katherine Findlay, we will establish contacts with groups at Brixham, Sidmouth and Torbay Museums to help with the preparation of a travelling display.

Local history groups in Newton St Cyres, Poltimore and Huxham, Blackdown Hills, Lustleigh and South Hams have been undertaking research projects on the agricultural returns of farm production 1912-20, and sharing findings and research expertise at the project workshops and by email.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e06130e21951.75263502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=1287</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Talk at Lincoln Historical Association, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>41DBB6D8-533F-4830-A2BC-8C955103A4A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 50 minute talk (plus questions) on Dr Rachel Duffett's WW1research which stimulated an interesting discussion about the soldiers' experience of war and also the way in which it has come to be remembered.

Io Theatre performed a version of JM Barrie's play about spiritualism and mourning.

Audience feedback (obtained via post-performance questionnaire and email) reported that the play raised issues relating to the war-time experience that audience members had not thought of before - e.g the appeal of spiritualism, the expectations for mourning.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ada95185a3c6.51374142</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=1825</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>From the Trenches to Tendring, HLF funded project - continued support/historical advice and talk at opening of the exhibition (reported by Rachel Duffett)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>287F16BA-99D3-49D7-AE40-503DD168BD8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project combined historical research and artistic outputs in an original and unusual manner; in addition to the more usual displays and banners, there were embroidered postcards and commemorative artefacts produced by a local artist. (The project had a specific remit to work with local schools on the postcards and artworks they'd collected.)

The opening evening of the exhibition was attended by Dr Rachel Duffett (who also gave a talk), along with a number of different groups, from local historians and members of a sewing circle who had worked with the artist to produce modern versions of WW1 silk postcards to representatives from Essex County Council and the WFA. 

Dr Duffett's talk and the exhibit were received with enthusiasm.

In addition to cementing relationships with local groups, Dr Duffett encouraged the project manager to write up some of the details of the project because she believed that it was interesting and publishable. Dr Duffett offered comments on the draft and suggested that it be sent to BALH Local History News, and it appeared there at the end of the year.

Each school was following a different theme around Everyday Life in Sheffield during the FWW, and Dr Moore made three visits to Sheffield to talk to Year 5 children on Food, Entertainment and Conscientious Objection. Each visit was followed by an event held for parents, teachers and children which included examples of work prepared by the children and a talk from Dr Moore on researching local and family stories.

The children were really enthused by their particular themes and produced some great work. They also had a lot of questions which were thought provoking including one child who asked 'How do you know when you have won the war?'

Feedback from one teacher was: 'I just wanted to pass on a huge thanks on behalf of our staff team to yourself for the session held this afternoon. It was great to see the children so engaged in the subject and to share the project with parents'.

Children were really enthusiastic. Working with the Whitfields, who are experienced in delivering education through drama, was enriching for both Dr Moore and the children. In addition to the impact noted below, is therefore the reciprocal learning experience for both the presenter (Dr Moore), the teachers, and the children.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b2f4be6afba6.51056519</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://watheatre.co/st-john-fisher-primary-school.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wheathampstead History Society, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9577F7B8-6EFE-41DD-B104-3039BEA05CF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>16 June 2015 Owen Davies gave a talk to the Wheathampstead History Society on 'Magic, Amulets and Mascots during the First World War'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e09562a471d1.02938770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=158</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk, Home, Food and Family in WW1 day, Avoncroft Museum, Bromsgrove (reported by Karen Hunt)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26993CA1-3ACA-4A04-9A05-526E0F13BC38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Karen Hunt's paper on ''The Kitchen is the Key to Victory; Women, food and the Great War' was the keynote address followed by contributions from other historians (postgraduates, academics and local historians) as well as volunteers from a number of community projects on the WW1 home front. Exhibitions and displays shared findings from a number of projects as well as creative engagements with the historical evidence. There were lively discussions in the sessions and networking between projects and interested groups such as local WIs between sessions.

The geographical reach was principally West Midlands, but some had come further, eg from Oxford.

Some notable impact arising from this activity includes discussions with participants on strategies to evaluate and contextualise the material gathered by community projects on the WW1 home front through comparison with other local projects, such as the Staffordshire Appeals Project, and by making links to current historical research being undertaken by academics and postgraduates.

This activity underlined the value of links between community projects and academic historians, particularly through shared recognition that researching mundane domestic life on the WW1 home front was not only fascinating but could challenge the traditional stories told of the war.

As a tour of one of Barrie's plays, A Well-Remembered Voice (unseen since its premiere in 1918 and which deals with one of the most striking developments of war-time life: the growth of spiritualism.), got underway in autumn 2016, Dr Maunder invited the readers to take a closer look at this neglected writer, not least for his attempts to say something about the trauma of war and its impact on those left behind. Dr Maunder encourages teachers to highlight J. M.

It featured 20 essays by 14 different contributors, and totalled 133 pages. It was printed in colour by Short-Run Press in Exeter, and we commissioned a second print-run of 100, because the first 100 were distributed after the initial printing in Sept. 2016, at the Devon History Society conference.
Although the production of a hard copy of the volume may appear 'old-fashioned', we asked contributors how they wanted the outputs to appear. We had suggested a website, but they all wanted a physical hard-copy, which they could keep, distribute to affiliated organisations and friends, and which was likely to be more tangible, and long-lasting than a website. We also put a PDF copy of the volume on the Devon History Society website and have given an electronic version to our partner organisation in Devon, the HLF-funded 'Devon Remembers' First World War project, run by the Devon Heritage Centre.

We hope that the publication will provide a template for other outputs produced by the 'Devon Remembers' HLF project.

Main purpose of this publication was to share information; stimulate thinking; and improve understanding of others' thinking.

The creation of the research group, and the desire to build upon the work completed, has led to the decision that work within the group will continue in 2017 with DRHP assistance, including a project symposium to be held at Exeter University in May 2017.

At the November project workshop, a number of volunteers recorded their interest in extending their research and contributing articles (including a number of co-authored pieces) to reflect the project's various strands, such as in-shore fishing in a themed edition of the Devon History Society's journal, The Devon Historian. It is duly anticipated that this Special Edition will be collated and printed next year. There are also plans for project volunteers to contribute towards a Special Edition of the Devon Gardens Trust journal, in liaison with one of the existing volunteers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b067cd136b70.17235253</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_R8sY_WBqbtbkVhWmE1QUc3ekU/view</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Feature in The Conversation (reported by Rachel Duffett)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>813517BF-4C42-4DBF-9B9D-292CA3703488</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following discussions with an editor, Dr Rachel Duffett wrote a piece on teeth, soldiers and WW1 - including diet, dentistry, etc.

The presentation, which included a Q&amp;amp;A session, ran over the course of an hour, and was a primary outcome for the project and volunteers. It provided a show-case for the research outputs of the group of 12-14 researchers, and allowed some presenters to both share their research findings, and their research methods. Devon History Society members are, primarily, active historical researchers, so were as interested in the discussion of sources as they were in the research conclusions. In particular, Penny Lawrence's discussion of the historical value of the 1910 valuations for the Incremental Value Duty tax for the reconstruction of historic farming/farm buildings and farmers' businesses aroused significant comment. It introduced a new set of resources to this group.

The 4 presenters were selected on the premise of demonstrating the interlinked strands of the project that related to First World War farming and food (to coincide with the conference's broader theme). The PI chaired this, with the PDRA in the audience. 

Eleven posters were displayed at this event, all of which were individually assembled by project volunteers. A tailored workshop was delivered in September, which sought to provide interested volunteers with the skills and know-how of making posters of their research. Furthermore around forty copies of the project publication were distributed to those in attendance, reflecting a high level of interest. 

The event had a regional reach; Devon History Society has c. 350 members and 67 affiliated local history societies within the county. Approximately 70 people attended the conference at the annual general meeting in October, and were very appreciative of the panel discussion session based on the project in the afternoon, plus the poster presentations in the foyer outside the conference room, and of free copies of the project booklet. We distributed 60-80 copies of this 100-page booklet on the day. 

The feedback from the conference organisers commented upon the 'very impressive' nature of the project's contribution, and that the '[Devon History Society] has received numerous compliments on what was presented - both in the lecture theatre and at the exhibition'. 

Several attendees asked for copies of the project booklet, and at least one member discussed the possibility of doing further research on the Incremental Value Duty records.

The main purpose of the event was to share information; stimulate thinking; and improve understanding of others' thinking. In addition to the significant impact noted below, two other notable outcomes from the activity included: requests about further participation and involvement, as well as plans made for future related activity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adb83e6aadb3.60722587</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.devonhistorysociety.org.uk/archive/food-farming-fishing-devon-first-world-war/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>St Albans Local History Network Day (reported by Julie Moore) 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5FEEDCE0-49FC-43F1-8449-0C5B5AC654AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Julie Moore was invited to attend this community event by the organiser with whom she and Professor Sarah Lloyd collaborated on a Connected Communities 'All our Stories' project.

The meeting arose from an AHRC Connected Communities project run from the Dept of Urban Studies in Sheffield (Translation across borders: Exploring the use, relevance and impact of academic research in the policy process). The meeting focussed on the government's centenary activities. While a number of government departments have centenary strands, DCLG approaches this task as a way of bringing communities together (e.g. the Last Post initiative in 2014 and the Victoria Cross paving stones). It was an interesting window into the thinking and constraints that shape such programmes, including the challenge of finding new material to feed into the process: too often the same examples cycle around. On the civil servants' side, there was a genuine openness to difficult histories and an appetite to locate new angles on some familiar narratives; what we gained from the meeting was an insight into the policy world of DCLG and the necessity of offering material in ways that made it useable (timely, accessible). 
 
As a result of the discussion we put together a FWW document for the policy analysts at DCLG. It included short pieces from the Centres outlining the sort of material or 'story' that the Centre could contribute, contact details, plus information on how a community group or project has already taken up or engaged with the topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9926190feb0.64526862</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Archive Handling Session: on Friday 11th November 2pm-3.30pm in Manchester Central Library (ground floor)  Archive Handling session for the RNCM-led research project 'Making music in Manchester in WW 1' (reported by Barbara Kelly)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E68F42F9-FC6A-4F61-8FD6-74EE75CD08BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Barbara Kelly and her project team arranged for an opportunity for the general public passing through Manchester Central Library on Remembrance Day to talk to project team members and to handle archival material.

In the afternoon William Macalpine, Research Scientist at Rothamsted Research, gave a tour of the National Willow Collection, which was founded in 1922 in response to concerns over the War's impact on willow stocks.

This event launched ELIW's collaborative project on FWW basketry &amp;amp; willows (led by Prof Owen Davies).

Discussion focused upon the development of the primary research questions and the possibilities of partnership and collaboration particularly so with the Everyday Lives in War Project.

Groups contacted included:
Archaeologists - The Layers of History Project.
Film makers - The Ermine Street Project.
Heritage groups - Aviation Heritage, Friends of the Lincoln Tank, Grimsby Heritage, The Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology
Community groups - Long Sutton Civic Society
Libraries - Lincoln Central Library
Museums - Museum of Lincolnshire Life, King's Lynn and Thetford Museums (also discussion of a potential project on 'Everyday Lives and Community in South Lincolnshire Agriculture: 1916-1918')

Following these initial contacts, email discussion between researchers and community groups brokered introductions. Discovery of the POW camp at Long Sutton, led to further meetings, including a tour of the relevant geographical area. A process of project content and research design followed, with the partners establishing the intended outputs for the project including a pamphlet, co-authored academic article concerning process, contributions to online databases such as Historypin, the Centre for British Archaeology's Home Front Legacy website and Lincolnshire County Council's website, and a conference panel paper. 

A contribution was made to the Everyday Lives in War Centre's website and newsletter introducing the research project into the prisoner of war camp in south Lincolnshire, detailing background information and including a number of unique cartoons illustrated by a German POW incarcerated in the camp. A further contribution was made to newsletter concerning the dissemination of the Centre's work on cartoons for Australian audiences by Professor Jane Chapman at the Eurasia-Silk Road-Byzantium conference at Macquarie University, Australia. Furthermore, as a number of collaborative partners read the contributions of the newsletter and website, this has helped to develop dialogue between partner groups.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e05fcb9487b5.51043642</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=764</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>First World War School Logbook Workshop, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A1C7E00-FE9A-470C-8077-8EDBBDD8E2FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A half-day workshop on First World War school logbooks; held at Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies on 2 February 2015. Workshop aims: to suggest possibility of applying for HLF funding; to connect groups to flag up differences and similarities of experience for a bigger project; to alert participants to the value of log books as a source for social history and an insight into everyday life.

Centre researchers had reported back from events in 2014 that a number of individuals and local history groups were looking at these sources as a centenary project. The workshop responded to these interests by providing an opportunity to compare findings and set the logbooks in broader context, with a postgraduate student explaining the legislative framework that had created this material. Participants shared research interests, collaborated on an exercise analysing a sample page and in some cases brought along logbooks currently in private collections. The county archivist addressed a major source of anxiety among the groups -- copyright and data protection; he also created a small exhibition of logbooks from the archive. The event was also an occasion to provide some ad hoc training on the use of electronic sources (notably Find My Past). 

There was extensive discussion and networking on the day. Participants suggested a follow-on event; information on copyright etc was circulated afterwards. One group from the workshop gave a talk, 'School log books: a rich resource for local historians' at the next meeting of the St Albans and District Local History Network in October 2015.

The participants ranged from descendants of COs or WW1 pacifists, community historians, filmmakers, museums, local and national peace groups and WW1 history or art/theatre projects. Most had an interest in peace history or peace activism, some had an interest in recovering the history of family members who had been prosecuted for pacifist activities during the war. National organisations, campaigning groups and NGOs such as WILPF, MAW, CND, PPU were represented as were our partners English Heritage, Leeds Museums and Galleries and museums such as the Bradford Peace Museum and York Railway Museum. Cultural and youth groups such as the Preservative party, filmmakers and theatre companies were also represented. Some gave presentations of their work, others displayed their materials on tables at a 'peace fair' that accompanied the conference. A panel of leading academic experts were invited to give the plenary session to a mixed audience. The conference was widely publicised on peace history and local networks, with flyers distributed nationally.

Each of the audiences interacted and engaged with the others through panels, talks, film showings and displays.

The aim of the conference was to raise the public profile of those who resisted the First World War as conscientious objectors or their supporters, or as religious, socialist or feminist groups. The year 2016 had been identified as an opportunity to intervene in the public narrative surrounding the centenary of the First World War and to shift the emphasis away from military topics by focussing on the introduction of conscription in 1916. The target audience was as mixed as possible and talks were aimed at an academic and non-academic participants. 

A key aim was to bring a range of approaches together to explore the topic from a variety of perspectives. The mix of university academics and postgraduate researchers, interest groups, local history groups, activists and organisations was an important part of the planning. 

The funded project with English Heritage explored social attitudes to COs using archival material and this knowledge was enhanced by plenary talks, films and panels as well as by the displays and exhibitions that accompanied the event.

The impacts were many: the success of the event convinced several UK and international academics of the value of co-produced research. 
The popularity of the event brought groups together and fostered collaboration and sharing of ideas and good practice. 
The City of Leeds and Leeds Museums and Galleries, who supported the event, were convinced that there was an audience for peace history, leading to the first Peace History Conference in Leeds in October 2016. 
Several local and community groups who presented their work at the conference found the interested and informed audiences who engaged with their presentations a validating experience. It also reinforced the connections and collaboration of the Peace History Working Group, who all attended the conference and drew lessons for the October Peace History Conference from the programme and activities.
The conference also raised awareness of the on-going campaign for justice for Alice Wheeldon, a supporter of COs during the war who was convicted on scant evidence of plotting against Lloyd George. Chloe Mason, who spoke at the conference, was able to recruit supporters for her campaign.
The interns who were involved in the research and organisation of the conference gained valuable employability skills and experience of working beyond the academy.

The was a good deal of overlap between attendees of the March and the October conferences, and there are plans for future activity to mark the centenary of the release of COs in 1919. There is also a commitment to foster Peace History Conferences in Leeds in future to complement those already held in London and Manchester.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c19f9828e6d0.11520395</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Englesea Brook Museum of Primitive Methodism, nr Crewe</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>99463283-04BF-4A08-80E5-EF73827B472A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Oh what a lovely war-resistance!' The ELIW Centre financially supported Englesea Brook Museum's musical evening on 15 September 2016, exploring the stories of those who, for a variety of reasons, stood against the First World War, with Clive Barrett from the Peace Museum, Bradford. A scratch choir of 25 local people was recruited for the event, who met for two rehearsals beforehand, and there was audience participation. As the Museum was too small to host the event, the nearby Alsager Methodist Church was hired for the occasion. 65 people attended.

The geographical reach was both local, regional and national. The articles are available online too. See links below.

The main focus is the general public. Schools were also aware of the research. Prof Kelly received an invitation to speak at a local high school as a result of the online publicity.

A notable impact of this activity was the awareness of the general public of the project. This would have made them more conscious of any subsequent activities, including the exhibitions and concerts. The project team received some correspondence from people who were interested to know more about the project.

In Germany, WW1 has been all but overwritten by the trauma of 1933-45 and stories of veterans and their post-war family life have received little attention. The new project aims to bring together a group of British and Bavarian elders in order to explore those very different family experiences and consider what that might mean in terms of our understanding of how the war has been remembered.

There have been a number of meetings with David Savill, Age Exchange's artistic director, and also a one day workshop in Blackheath with the Bavarian organisers on 20th April 2015 when Roper and Duffett discussed their research and the links between that and the project.

The continual development of this exciting and original project (awarded significant HLF funding in December 2015) should offer an insight into different national perspectives and new possibilities for working with memories of the war.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df12c14e3f84.89858704</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.age-exchange.org.uk/what-we-do/arts-projects/current-projects/meeting-in-no-mans-land-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>HLF East of England Regional Office meetings 2015+</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0E1CDB9-2037-4EBD-8F9C-02E387950BFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Series of meetings and contacts with HLF East of England team: initially to introduce the Everyday Lives in War Centre, discuss how the Centre could support local FWW projects, and review contacts we already had with HLF-funded projects in the region.

The preview attracted a good audience and wide coverage in the local press. 

As well as being a staple of the army's diet, some of the biscuits were creatively re-fashioned by soldiers in the trenches and sent home to friends and family with personal messages. Rather than being consumed, the biscuits were transformed into picture frames, postcards and canvases. These army biscuits have formed the inspiration for The First World War in Biscuits, which is a stunning audio-visual, object-centred installation that explores the relationship between food, creativity and conflict. Included is a unique collection of 100 year-old ration biscuits, personally modified by soldiers, alongside a range of archival materials, interviews, photographs and film-footage.

As well as being able to see examples of how these biscuits were crafted by soldiers, this exciting installation provides an opportunity to hear historians talk about the army biscuit and the significance of food during the war, including Dr Rachel Duffett, author of 'Stomach for Fighting: Food and Soldiers of the Great War' (Manchester University Press, 2012), who discusses her research on the significant role food plays during times of conflict and reflects on the ration biscuits displayed in the exhibition. Duffett reported: 'The Minories did us proud and the exhibit looked great, it's a fascinating combination of modern multimedia and very old hardtack biscuits- we were most grateful to the Museum of Reading for loaning their wonderful objects'. 

Outcomes and impact from the exhibition include; developing links with local arts groups regarding commemoration activities; establishing a relationship with Teresa Murjas at Reading University with a view to future events including the potential for the exhibit to be included in the National Archive for the conference in September 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df17dc2bd8c8.02776697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to Basketry Collection, IWM Duxford</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F783346B-8BE8-4546-B55A-02F9B9A1CF7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A small group of basket-makers, willow-growers and members of the heritage craft community visited IWM Duxford on 29.9.16 to view items held in store.

The diary was retrieved via house clearance and was not known to the group. It offers a fascinating picture of everyday life in which war is somewhere in the background but not at all prominent. The diary created great interest and has since been sent to the group to study in detail.

The group has extensive knowledge of the places mentioned in the diary. As a result of the meeting members expressed an interest in developing a follow-on HLF-funded project based on the diary, particularly relating to Edward's passion for the local countryside and books, and revolving around young people 'tracing' his footsteps and creating their own video diaries. The project and application are currently under discussion, and would include ongoing support from the centre.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d95b00d64168.78857743</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=938</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Email correspondence with HLF funded First World War projects (reported by Jane Chapman)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A02610A-3A01-4D23-8A7F-8AD4768DCD12</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Jane Chapman reports an email dialogue with a large number of regional HLF funded First World war projects.

The Exhibitions attracted various audiences at the two institutions. People commented on the items on display and sometimes asked for further information. Short explanatory notes accompanied the displayed objects. The Exhibition moved to the RNCM in time for the three days of concerts and discussions. 

General public, students and staff indicated that they had learned something from seeing the Exhibition.

It has generated interest within the college about the musical history of the city and also of the college during WWI. It has informed plans for a major collaboration with the Paris Conservatoire in 2018 on Manchester and Paris in 1918. It has influenced senior decision makers about this future project.

The geographical reach included both local and regional. The audience was the general public which attends the lunchtime concerts at the RNCM. This project was able to benefit from the RNCM's regular concert schedule. It provides a great opportunity for reaching the concert-going public. The Carole Nash Recital room was full. The students organised and performed the works in the concert.

The audience of 95 people was made up of business people in their lunch break; parents with young children, and retired people. It was mainly the latter group who were able to stay for the 'meet the team' session that followed the concert.

The purpose was to present new knowledge to audiences and to engage them in reflection and discussion.

Students were active in selecting the programme. Some audience members were able to stay afterwards to discuss the project with the team. This group was forthright about their thoughts on our short presentations; they also provided suggestions about how they might like to be involved and what might interest them. They were keen to have a participatory session with amateur choral groups performing some of the repertoire.

Prof Kelly and her team's contribution included 3 talks on aspects of the project; live performance of Debussy's Sonata for Cello and Piano; handling of archival materials and open discussion with the public.

Members of the public (including visitors from the North West who regularly attend events connected to the Manchester Histories Festival) attended this event and there were many opportunities for discussion and for the public to ask questions of the materials on display and the project findings. A few members of the public indicated their links to some of the people we were studying. Audience response was enthusiastic. After the event, audience members had greater understanding of music-making in Manchester during WW1.

The event was attended by a photographer from the Manchester Histories Festival as well as by a film maker, who was preparing a film on research at the RNCM.

The event was selected as one of the five top events of interest by the Manchester Wire:

The three workshops were held on 29th Apr, 27th June, and 7th Nov 2016. The first two events were at a meeting room at Exeter Central Library, the final meeting was at the Devon Heritage Centre. Each followed the same format, of a discussion structured around a particular research theme, and involving an invited speaker. The meeting on 27th Apr focused on Fishing and Market Gardening and Food Supply; the meeting of 27th June focused on Inshore Fishing and Oral Histories of the Home Front; the meeting on 7th Nov was a summary event, focusing particularly on agricultural statistics and recruitment of farmers during the First World War. Guest speakers were Samantha Little on Brixham fishing; Paul Cleave on food during wartime; Richard Batten on recruitment of farmers. The workshop on 27th June was also designed to discuss the template for essays to be included in the project publication, which was completed in Aug 2016, and printed in Sept &amp;amp; Dec 2016.

Participants included members of local history groups in Newton St Cyres, Poltimore &amp;amp; Huxham, Blackdown Hills, Lustleigh &amp;amp; South Hams, Teignmouth and Brixham, Sidmouth, Topsham, and Throwleigh (Dartmoor). 

Main purpose of activity was to share information; stimulate thinking; and improve understanding of others' thinking.

Some notable impacts that arose from this activity include:

? Group interaction - described as 'project workshops and conference/ exhibition designed to be 'show-and-tell' events' in the original funding application. Feedback gathered suggests the project was successful in its focus on group interaction through bringing together participants over time into a functioning, productive research group; '...the project has brought together the separate strands into a cohesive whole with each participant having a better understanding'. There were numerous mentions of 'increased collaboration' and how this had strongly contributed towards the overall success of outputs, especially as the project had progressed. This level of group interaction was deemed successful because of the variety of group members and their motivations for taking part. One respondent observed that the 'right people were in the room' to effect co-production; '...it was good to work with people from a range of backgrounds: and who have experienced research from a range of sources. It was good to see and hear from local historians as well as professionals'. Another commented upon the fact that 'Informal workshops and conversation of both 'amateur' local researchers and professional historians very useful'. A further reaction was that 'being part of such a learned group made research between meetings all the more stimulating. Everything happened at just the right pace'. Thus for this participant, the balance between setting tasks between the project workshops and the length of time between meetings operated successfully. 

? Enabling knowledge - the funding application had stated that this would be achieved 'through workshops to share research finding and presentational styles, discussing research approaches and interpretations, identify problems in source availability, interpretation or presentation'. This objective was met predominantly through the delivery of six workshop meetings, all held in Exeter over the course of fourteen months. The intention behind these was a focus upon shared interaction and involvement within the group; as much as about presenting findings and knowledge as it was formal presentations. Specialist external speakers were recruited e.g. Dr Nicola Verdon (Sheffield Hallam University), who gave a talk on female agricultural labour at the third workshop in February 2016. Experts based in the local area were also utilized, such as Dr Paul Brassley (University of Exeter), who is a leading academic on the subject of war-time farming. In this instance, Paul provided the group with an understanding of First World War farming from the national perspective, before delving into some of Devon's regional nuances. We also drew upon researchers who had conducted work over a number of years, such as Dr Jacqueline Sarsby, who shared her insight into the experiences of one farmer on the fringes of Dartmoor. 

Respondent feedback on how useful the project group was for sharing research findings and source availability follow:
o 'workshop sessions mainly useful and thought provoking - made me aware of aspects that I was unaware of. Gave access to online sources not easily available, i.e. through university library'.
o 'To search for the more obscure sources, for example parish magazines'. 
o 'the availability of national statistical sources e.g. parish agricultural returns and relevant national publications e.g. MAF agricultural and livestock returns'.

? Sharing expertise - this was originally listed as &amp;quot;Community Partners drive the project by accumulating, sharing and evaluating research expertise (those with substantial relevant research expertise will provide a 'beginners guide' to such research) and academic partners will offer a planning framework, project timetable and contextual historical information.&amp;quot; According to one participant, the project &amp;quot;evolved and developed partnerships between members and their organisations. And has encouraged sharing and dissemination of knowledge&amp;quot;. 

All researchers mentioned the workshops in a positive light at some point within their feedback. To dwell upon this further, the feedback is now themed specifically into the organisation of the workshops, response to the talks given a number of internal and external speakers and, finally the opportunity to collaborate with other group members:
? Organisation of workshops and outputs: 'The workshops have been well organised and managed'...'The workshops have provided a forum and exchange' and '[I] am impressed by the speed with which 'food farming and fishing in Devon in WW1' publication was produced' 

? Useful Speakers: 'Workshop seminars mainly useful and thought provoking - make me aware of aspects of courses that I was unaware of', '...excellent and very useful to have a range of speakers to promote thought, across the subject matter'. The majority consensus was that the volunteers enjoyed hearing keynote speakers at each workshop, which were able to provide an in-depth presentation to an aspect of at least one of the project's four themes.

? Collaboration and encouraging group work: 'Research can be a solitary occupation, sharing ideas is very beneficial' and 'After enjoying Richard Batten's thesis it gave me some ideas, and I realised I could bring some information to the project'. The fact that slots for open discussion within the workshops - allowing members to report on their progress in a friendly and unintimidating manner - was appreciated, and served as a method of enabling constructive conversations between project members. One particular example was an exercise prepared by Dr Neville at the second project workshop (February 2016). Its purpose was to allow all present volunteers to partake in an exercise that used the Kelly's Directories, at a suitable pace, which could then be applied independently for future research. As the project grew, interaction between members was increasingly common (Dr Paul Cleave spoke at several members' local organisations about his research on wartime food, at their request). 
When asked about whether improvements could have been made to the project, eight respondents could not think of anything which could have been done differently. The remaining three provided positive statements instead - this seems to denote a good reception amongst those who took part: 
? 'From my point of view I have been impressed by how the project has developed'.
? 'I felt it worked successfully as it was a good balance of group activity, expert speakers and enough time in between workshops to yield quality personal research'.
? 'Would have been good to get funding to continue the project and develop themes identified so far'. 
One possible area of development would have been to provide further guidance on statistics, so as to encourage more consistent approaches across the researchers: 
'Possibly further guidance on the available stats and handling/ analysing them as to some extent we all invented our own wheels.' 
This was largely due to the initial challenges of sourcing the material (from the National Archives at Kew) and subsequently the pace at which people carried out individual research. As the project started to blossom, some members were happy to focus predominantly upon a niche area (e.g. the agricultural statistics of their locale), and it sometimes proved tricky to balance the needs of those working on individual project strands with the group as a whole. The recruitment of volunteers interested in fishing, who had expressed their respective interest through the 'Devon Remembers' Heritage Project, proved difficult to reconcile until the spring of 2016. Following the brokering of introductions and the successful recruitment of these individuals, this meant that we could feature a number of workshop talks to account for the research areas they were interested in exploring. Fortuitously, their introduction helped to garner the group together in forging a cohesive identity as a collective body of researchers. What operated well was the fact that existing members were very happy to interact with findings being presented by those working on other strands - this philosophy of mutual respect helped to create a positive atmosphere amongst the group as a whole. Though fostering and nurturing in this way took time - over the course of a year - it certainly seems to have paid off in the longer run.
On that same theme, the very nature of co-design and co-production proved tricky to explain as a principle, without the risk of coming across as patronising! Some volunteers had clearly identified the requirements that higher education institutions must now do more to interact through the concept of 'public engagement'. However, the open-ended scope to allow for members to design the purpose and ways of working within the project was not conveyed as effectively as it could have been. One member recorded their struggle to understand this approach; 
'The original outline as presented to me was exceedingly sketchy, I almost did not proceed - I'm glad I did.'
In the future, more support should be provided to members of co-production groups to help them come together more effectively, and to realise that this ambiguity at the start of the project is essentially a core benefit of the mantra behind such research projects (rather than a hindrance). The model of presenting a range of material to members, allowing them to respond to it, and thus granting the opportunity for them to map out their own interests within the confines of the project framework, is one that worked eventually in this instance. However now that these academics have a clearer understanding of how it operates in reality, more could be done to iron out any initial concerns from volunteers. 
In spite of this, it is important that such slight improvements do not overshadow the positive project feedback expressed by those involved. Overall, it is best to summarise the success of the workshops and success of the overall project management in a quote from one particularly satisfied researcher: 'Stimulating workshops, supportive leadership, and opportunity for group members to report back and create concrete outcomes. An involving and enlightening experience.'
From the post-project skills audit, 10 out of the 11 (91%) volunteer researchers mentioned that their skills had increased from the start of the project to now and had learned new knowledge or techniques, and the remaining researcher had expanded their existing skills. Most comments referred to improving the quality of their research techniques, how to better interpret and display findings and to be critical of sources:
? 'Amount of care and checking required when transcribing. Thinking about different ways to prevent figures and statistics.' 
? 'Use of computer programmes to analyse and present results.' 
? 'Introduction of academic rigour - ensuring option-fact based - going into greater depth.' 
? 'To be critical of sources and to question perceived views of what happened, for example the governments and national understanding.' 
One respondent commented on how their confidence had grown due to participation in the project to expand their research focus further; 'Skills developed to have confidence in new research topics'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b06cf72d0c76.65543130</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FWW briefing for HLF Staff, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FE5410D-69D2-419F-A9E3-D7F62D45D943</gtr:id><gtr:impact>4.12.15 Dr Nick Mansfield gave a Knowledge Briefing on 'Working Class people and the First World War' for Heritage Lottery Fund staff dealing with FWW projects.

Dr Ingrid Sharp reports that English Heritage was very eager for the University of Leeds staff and interns to feed into this content and in particular to provide some of the contextual information needed to understand the cell block. Charlotte Tomlinson wrote a well-received article, 'Attitudes to Conscientious Objection' and Cyril Pearce contributed a vital article, 'Conscription and Conscience in the First World War'. A new article based on the final report would allow us to think more specifically about attitudes in Richmond as opposed to more general responses to the First World War.

The project's findings will inform the context of the larger EH project on the Richmond Castle Cells. This was the first analysis of local press coverage of tribunals and the issue of COs, so will provide a useful starting point for further investigation.

This was excellent for the postgraduate researchers, who developed skills in writing for a general audience and showcased co-produced research, as the contribution of the volunteers and interns was shared in these outputs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2ca18b9b2a6.54469835</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/richmond-castle/richmond-graffiti/attitudes-to-cos/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Volunteer Study Session - Preston, 7 July 2016 (reported by Keith Vernon)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3729EC54-816F-4FE4-A7A9-1349051D2F93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Keith Vernon reports on a study session, which was arranged to bring volunteers working on the project together and encompassed a range of activities, including setting up research activities and agreeing on approaches, training in research methods, addressing queries and problems, and discussing research findings.

Such positive stories arising out of a wartime experience challenged the prevailing view among the volunteers of the war as overwhelmingly associated with loss and sacrifice.

This was an opportunity to compare experiences and share stories, sources and ideas for new questions to ask. A film of the day was made and posted on the ELIW website to reach those who were unable to attend but had expressed an interest in connecting with other groups. 

Some notable outcomes and impacts include:
1) Those attending swapped contact details and expressed a desire to connect up their research.
2) Request for further information.
2) Development of a network of researchers interested in the theme of Resistance to War.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b0987e056836.66041940</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=2252</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imperial War Museum Centenary Partnership Meeting, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C02BA36A-5697-4494-A673-3192EC9F0228</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sarah Lloyd attended the Centenary Partnership meeting at the Imperial War Museum, London, on 10 November 2015.

Ca 60 people from the Colchester and NE Essex area came to a screening of the Battle of the Somme 1916. Seeing the film projected on to a big screen was the reason for many participants' attendance, and Ian Hook's talk on the Essex Regiment's experiences of the battle was also a strong draw. The event provided the opportunity for the FTTTT HLF project to showcase their terrific (and unusual) outputs and we were also able to display recent research from the Essex WFA branch.

It was a wonderfully lively evening with a terrific mixture of the old and the modern - the film's documentary footage contrasted with the artistic interpretations from FTTTT. A great discussion was had following Ian Hooks' presentation, and getting a local perspective on a global event was fascinating. The audience found the film especially moving - it was the first time that many had seen it on such a big screen.

The Forum was designed to enable public discussion and support the activities of the Centenary Hub. The pilot was structured to explore if and how a forum could prompt and support the online conversations that contribute to community research and to the aims of the Engagement Centre programme. The team developed 7 discussion threads: each one focused on a topic known to be of interest to community groups (including conscientious objection, food and farming).

Both Historypin and the Everyday Lives team observed very low levels of engagement and contribution, with much a higher number of visitors viewing but not joining the discussion. This was despite very targeted active outreach and personal follow ups with a range of individuals and groups explaining how to use the Forum and inviting them to participate in relevant topics. Invited participants have given a range of informal responses about this might be. Responses largely coalesced around the following concerns: time management, other commitments and priorities, reluctance about publishing 'work in progress' on an open online environment, copyright concerns, and a general dislike of social media amongst invited participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac50e4451551.03888184</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.historypin.org/en/first-world-war-centenary</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Performance of JM Barrie's A Well-Remembered Voice in collaboration with IO Theatre, OSO Arts Centre, Barnes, 7-8 October 2016 (reported by Andrew Maunder)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>151F4FE6-A448-4409-A354-A2B9F1874A84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Andrew Maunder reports a staged performance of JM Barrie's play A Well-Remembered Voice (1918).

Those attending reported a change in how they understood the FWW and one member of the public gave this feedback

'We all found the morning extremely informative and very enjoyable.

Centre researchers Jim Beach (military intelligence) and Owen Davies (supernatural beliefs) were joined by panellists from the Imperial War Museum, National Army Museum, Historypin and Bletchley Park itself.

Over the course of two hours around 90 visitors came to the Roadshow. Most of these were visiting the museum and encountered the Roadshow in the course of their tour. Bletchley Park offered free admission to anyone coming specifically to attend the Roadshow, including 5 people with FWW memorabilia to show the experts. Owen Davies's collection of FWW protective charms and talismans offered an insight into less familiar aspects of the conflict, with the display eliciting several family stories, including one man whose Australian grandfather was considered so 'lucky' in battle that other men tried to join his regiment. From a research point of view, it was interesting that several members of the public knew about the swastika being a positive ancient symbol. 

The event gave us an opportunity to hear the views of those who had not sought out a FWW event, rather than the more usual self-selected audiences. Experience at the Roadshow will inform plans for future events (e.g. inclusion of displays) and will feed into understanding of the centenary.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d70074c7f561.41727697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=822</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition and Event held by East Herts WW1 Group 'Seeing it Through' (reported by Julie Moore)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A3869843-6A21-46A1-8380-58118D2B6323</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Julie Moore was invited to give a talk on Everyday Life in War at an event and exhibition set up by the East Herts WW1 group for their HLF project entitled 'Seeing it Through'.

Continuing interest beyond the life of the HLF project into researching stories around food during the FWW and maintaining contact between the project members and the ELIW Centre.

As a result, she was invited back to meet a 'gifted and talented' group on 9 Feb 2016. The teacher emailed subsequently: 'The students are really inspired and enthused which is lovely to see and I hope it will result in some interesting research.' Both classes focused on everyday life during the FWW and provided a contrast with the soldier's diary the school has already used (funded by an HLF grant).

The Everyday Lives in War Centre has offered to make a digital postcard with the students, based on an Everyday Lives in War topic they select and research. This will be along the lines already created by a work-experience student from a different school. 

Through 2016, the Centre remained in touch with the School inviting students to attend performances of FWW theatre in April and October 2016. In October, the teacher emailed detailed feedback, plus the following: 'Thank you so much for thinking of us and we would certainly like to be invited to future performances, I love to see what the students take from it and they always surprise me!' (Justine Marcham).

Following the second visit to Onslow St Audrey, the 6th-form coordinator has asked about bringing students to the University library to access support and sources for their projects. We ran this in March 2016 &amp;amp; Jan 2017.

The classes were a fascinating insight into young people's lives, their understandings of the FWW and the contrasts between 1917 and 2016. These observations will feed into work with the Swindon Great War group on Edward Taylor's diary (assuming that project finally gets underway)

2. observing the meeting activities for research purposes (two articles forthcoming)
3. contributing historical context for the participants

There are two principal outcomes:
1. two academic articles on the project, one about family history and the motivations for First World War commemoration, the other on Age Exchange and the relationship between reminiscence work and oral history. Both have been drafted and will be submitted by end of April 2017.
2. input to the Meeting itself, and the resulting film. Outputs are listed at this url:

On the closing Sunday, Dr Roper gave a public lecture in Rosenheim on British legacies of the First World War. There was wide interest in the lecture among the German audience, and the resources from it were widely circulated.

Prof Roper chaired an evaluation which was filmed and in which organisers discussed the overall impact. A similar filmed evaluation also took place for the 24 participants from Britain and Germany.

It had a strong focus on community-led research: 'Voices of the Home Fronts is a great opportunity to hear about recent and ongoing research, inspire you to conduct new research and foster collaborations both nationally and internationally. Topics will include military tribunals, conscientious objection, prisoners of war, voluntary organisations, racial and ethnic experiences, life under bombardment, refugees, international home fronts, women's employment, health, food, dissent, newspapers, literature, profiteering, advertising, fashion, family life and more.' Formats included poster presentations, theatre performance, films made by community groups on FWW topics, talks and papers.

12 poster presentations
57 talks (including 20 by heritage professionals; 9 by community groups; 16 by independent researchers).
98 registrations in addition to speakers, plus 3 early career researchers awarded bursaries to attend and tweet from the conference.

During the conference, the conference website received 150-220 visitors a day (with c.300 page views a day), much of this traffic coming via Twitter. The ELIW website also reported increased traffic.

The conference website will continue in 2017 to build a community of researchers following on from the conference and towards a 2nd event in 2018.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac608f80c7d6.25583396</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.voicesofthehomefronts.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk, Sopwell Residents' Association, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F48B8ECD-C438-4ADA-9E3D-594D5D80DC67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Julie Moore was invited by Sopwell Residents' Association to give annual talk to attendees on possible HLF projects that could be pursued as well as the wider work of the First World War Engagement Centres.

Main purpose of this activity was to stimulate thinking.

Io Theatre performed a version of JM Barrie's play about spiritualism and mourning to groups of Year 8 students and above. The event generated discussion about a) Barrie and b) the role of spiritualism in the WW1. Students were asked to complete a writing activity on the play as a follow-up.

A notable impact, in addition to the below, was that the School continued to work on the play text, and reported increased student awareness about the issues and also about ways of staging theatrical performance.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ada2af1e0803.18781045</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=1825</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop for Minorities Stroke and Aphasia Group, North London - the group have been awarded an HLF grant to explore food on the battle front (reported by Rachel Duffett)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5BF205C2-D009-4044-A042-47F41D1CCAA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Rachel Duffett held initial meetings with the group leader and project manager to set up an afternoon workshop on WW1 army food for the whole group (ca 20 participants). Dr Duffett showed them materials from the conflict, and they had a lively discussion about researching food matters, e.g. archives, museum visits, websites, etc.

The audience was made up of ca 50% 'patients' (or rather, ex-patients, as some would go on to be receiving post-stroke care), who were linked by their medical experiences, as well as ca 50% carers.

This was a relatively unusual group in that there was no specific history interest in it; Dr Duffett was not wholly clear how they came to the subject. However, the experience was hugely rewarding because the group was approaching the project with such enthusiasm and regarded it almost as a therapeutic activity - an opportunity to keep their minds active, learn new skills, uncover information etc. Very different from any other group that Dr Duffett has worked with.

The group had limited understanding of how to research such a topic, but following the event they felt much better equipped to do so. They were also enthused by the subject and keen to explore it on their own.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6f3016a0a28.94618154</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Schools workshop: Produced in collaboration with Orleans Gallery as part of the After Tipperary project, 2016 (reported by Andrew Maunder)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>970FCC4C-3209-4590-880F-298AFB07BD20</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Andrew Maunder co-produced a workshop for primary schools in the borough of Richmond.

The first relates to the collaborative work with Age Exchange in preparation for the Meeting in No Man's Land in April 2016. 

From 11-13 January 2016, Prof Roper and Dr Rachel Duffett took part in a two day workshop in Rosenheim Bavaria with Age Exchange together with their two German partners, Caritas in Rosenheim, M&amp;uuml;nchner Bildungswerke Programme, Die Lange Schatten des Krieges De Munchenburg in Munich. This entailed a presentation by Prof Roper in which he set out the context of legacies in Britain for the other organisers. 

In addition, Prof Roper and Dr Duffett also contributed to the planning of activities and interview schedules at this meeting and in subsequent meetings with Age Exchange's Director, David Savill, at the University of Essex on 25 February 2016, and via email. Roper/Duffett recorded blogs from this and subsequent meetings. .

The geographical reach for these two activities was across London, Essex, Munich and Rosenheim.

Prof Roper's and Dr Duffett's input contributed to the overall focus on the project on family legacies, and the Interview schedules and other legacy-related activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2f8c59bbed9.73431416</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=1235</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ECR conference IWM North</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2870B78-5CF7-4DC5-B6FA-0E5234631F65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On the 26 &amp;amp; 27 February 2016, IWM North played host to the inaugural event organised by the First World War Postgraduate and Early Career Researchers Network (FWW Network). The conference committee comprised Philippa Read (Chair), Chris Phillips, David Swift and Oliver Wilkinson, with Nick Mansfield from the Everyday Lives in War Centre acting as a mentor. The group, set up in January 2014 as a self-sustaining off-shoot of IWM North's Academic Network is dedicated to connecting early stage researchers working on any aspect of the First World War, in order to facilitate new debates, ideas and collaborations relating to the study of the conflict. We further aim to create partnerships between these scholars and organisations, groups, and individuals operating beyond the academy who can offer alternative insights and agendas, opening possibilities for the co-design and co-production of research. Our event, held in the Libeskind Room of IWM North was, therefore, designed to be inclusive.

It combined the latest academic scholarship from established and emerging researchers (30 research papers were delivered in parallel sessions over the two days alongside three keynote addresses by leading scholars in the field), with participation from heritage agencies, libraries, museums, archives, funding bodies, community groups and individual researchers. The academic contributions, which included substantial postgraduate involvement supported by Royal Historical Society bursaries, were augmented by information stands representing important archival repositories (The National Archives), museums (IWM; Leeds Museums &amp;amp; Galleries), organisations (Historic England), funding bodies (The Heritage Lottery Fund; AHRC First World War Engagement Centres), and ongoing commemorative projects (IWM Lives of the First World War).

Meanwhile, the conventions of the traditional academic conference were stretched thanks to performances and displays from creative artists inspired by the First World War. Social media was mobilized both to promote the event and to carry the ideas and debates taking place in Manchester to a wider audience via the network's Twitter account (@FwwNetwork) and conference hashtag (#fwwcm16). As of 28 March 2016 the network's Twitter account has 777 followers, is following 1,314, and has made 336 tweets). The five AHRC First World War Engagement Centres, who co-funded the event, were represented throughout the conference and contributed to the discussions and debates that it facilitated. Their participation consisted of papers offered by researchers linked to the various centres and an illuminating roundtable discussion between scholars, community researchers, archives and funding bodies. The conference was almost full to capacity with ninety two participants attending across the two days.

Following the success of the conference, the Network approached ELIW for help in developing opportunities for early career and postgraduate researchers. A successful bid to the AHRC has funded the Network for a further 3 years, with a programme including community engagement and research co-production.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac541f9e9c07.26993646</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://fwwnetwork.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Welwyn Hatfield Heritage Fair, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3220A7F8-C23A-4847-BEB8-43EE6460FEA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The First World War Centre had a stall at the Welwyn Hatfield Heritage Fair on 17 October 2017.

In October 2016, the project displayed exhibition panels at the University of Hertfordshire, including material from the First World War period. The project team ran a related drama and mask workshop with 9 undergraduate students.

We engaged around 100-120 directly though the exhibition, and indirectly the number was closer to 400-500 with posters, plasma screens, social media (twitter), University news items and email circulations. There were a number of students and staff who had expressed interest in the stories, many writing a postcard of their own heroines and signing the guestbook. Overwhelmingly positive responses from those that engaged with the project. There were some responses singling out a particular heroine and questioning why they were included, three individuals questioned Boudica's inclusion in the exhibition - this gave an opportunity to discuss in depth aspects of HHH and the project themes.

It was an occasion to discover the largely untold story of how the tribunals worked and the circumstances of those who came before them. The day featured talks from volunteer researchers who revealed the richness of the surviving sources and the remarkable extent of appeals against conscription. Academic researchers in the field contributed a broader context to the discussion.

Following the event, the Centre received a number of enquiries about the workshop. In response we posted contributions from other military service projects on the Centre website and commissioned a film of the day for wider viewing and participation. The Centre will hold a studyday on conscientious objection on 7 May 2016. Many of the participants from the first workshop have expressed an interested in attending, with representatives of 2 community groups agreeing to talk about their findings.

Participants in the sessions recorded that their understanding of the topic, and of the nature and impact of the First World War on local communities, was revised by the work they had done. The project focussed on the lives and experiences of predominantly younger people, many of whom were found to have long and productive lives after the war. Such positive stories arising out of a wartime experience challenged the prevailing view among the volunteers of the war as overwhelmingly associated with loss and sacrifice.

Requests were made about further participation and involvement, and plans were made for future related activity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beefefecdb59.33330942</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference 'Staffordshire Military Appeals Study Day' (reported by Julie Moore)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>59FFE622-D2E0-40DA-BE93-CBB9CCBEF725</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invitation to speak at this one-day event came from members of the Staffordshire Archives who had contributed to the Everyday Lives In War Military Tribunals Workshop held in September 2015.

Each event offered talks from university- and community-based researchers, and a variety of stalls and exhibits. The events also included some undirected networking time as well as lively roundtable discussions.

These three events aimed to bring together community groups and other organisations developing or working on projects around the heritage of the First World War in order to share experiences, exchange ideas, learn about resources and explore possible sources of funding. The roadshow was a collaboration with a broad range of community project representatives, local historians, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the First World War Centenary Partnership, Lives of the First World War, Historypin, and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis (CDDA).

Contacts made at the events created links between projects (e.g. introductions via the Centre to projects in different geographical locations with similar interests), consolidated partnerships through networking and suggested new project ideas (e.g. through use of the Council for British Archaeology's Home Front Legacy tools). Contacts are still emerging some 5 months after the roadshow.

Experience in 2015 will feed into plans for cross-centre activity in 2016. These will attempt to widen the demographic profile of participants, build on feedback received (e.g. include more practical information), and expand the use of social media to support and share the roadshow.

As a result, 38 delegates attended the concert. It was an excellent way to communicate the research to an audience from several continents.

This was a concert of repertoire at the centre of the project. It was repertoire that was performed by students at the Royal Manchester College of Music during WWI. The project has been tracing a number of these students. One was Frank Tipping, who was a prize winning violinist at the RMCM and a member of the Hall&amp;eacute; orchestra who died in action in 1917. The PI gave an introduction to the concert outlining the project, the research and explaining the choice of repertoire.

After the concert and talks, members of the audience engaged in discussion about music during WWI, making comparisons between Manchester and other cities, such as Paris and London. Some students involved in the performances said how interesting they had found it and how it had increased their understanding of the RMCM and also music during the First World War. Requests were made about further participation and involvement, and there are plans for future related activity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bdac4e998871.66768851</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.rncm.ac.uk/uploads/RNCM-Autumn-2016-brochure.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>`Berta Ruck: A war-time best-seller', Story Room, Everyday Lives in War, 9 July 2016 (reported by Andrew Maunder)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>65CAA471-5529-4687-A936-3DAFA7BB9FFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Andrew Maunder contributed an article on the then popular (and nowadays lesser known) First World War novelist and best-seller, Berta Ruck, for the Everyday Lives in War Story Room.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1ad606fb5c9.76093789</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?cat=30</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting in No Man's Land film screening, Sunday 13 November 2016 (reported by Michael Roper)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>081B7E32-B91E-4DAE-BCBB-5B8973390D4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Michael Roper reports that the film from the April event of the Meeting was premiered at a community cinema in Rosenheim on 13 November 2016 to an audience of around 100, including participants and their families, schools and members of the general public.

Centre members gave presentations at the Anglo-American Historians Conference (London, July 2014). Among the specialist meetings that have taken place are discussions with theatre companies, religious groups and members of a learning disability forum.

These activities have helped us to design a responsive programme of Centre workshops which will run from November 2014 to summer 2015.

The Social Attitudes group of interns and volunteers prepared a newspaper style handout with the findings of the project and a display presenting the project. As PI of the project and co-organiser of the event, she was interviewed on BBC Radio Leeds and gave a talk on German Conscientious Objectors..

This was mainly UK-based, but we had a focus on German resistance to war and invited a leading German expert to the panel. Contributors came from all over the UK but there was a large contingent of local/regional groups and individuals.

Groups and individuals with an interest in peace history and peace activism were the main audience for this event.

The Peace History Conference has been held in London and Manchester for the last 10 years. This was the first year we brought it to Leeds and the aim was to expand the reach of the conference. Thanks to the support of sponsors, the costs could be kept very low and a local audience could attend without the expense of travel or high fees. The event was well-attended, the speakers excellent and the interns did a superb job of organising the conference and presenting their work. Leeds Museums and Galleries arranged for the room to be offered without charge and provided technical support for the entire day, also free of charge. This was the second time that a peace history event was held in Leeds and a feeling of community has started to emerge. The relationship between the local and national peace organisations and the University is now excellent, to the benefit of all concerned. In terms of content, many people were surprised to discover the extent of anti-war activism in Germany during and after WW1, and this was followed up with another interview on BBC Radio Leeds specifically on German anti-war activism.

In particular, the message about German anti-war resistance was new to many, but the research into local press coverage of COs was also new and revealing.

In addition to the significant outcome/impact noted below were: requests for further participation/involvement; plans made for future activity; colleagues reporting change in views and opinions; and requests for further information.

Introduction by the PI. The concert was performed by a group of c.80 students. This group benefitted from participating in the project. It also involved Masters-level student conductors

The geographical reach included both local, regional and international audiences. The international audience were participating in a conference on Nationalism and Translationalism that was organised by the PI. There were 330 people at the concert in the RNCM Concert Hall. 

This was an orchestral concert, which was programmed during the regular lunchtime slot at the RNCM. It meant that we were able to reach a committed audience. The concert was preceeded by an introduction given by the PI. The purpose was to share the findings and repertoire of the project to a range of audiences.

Members of the audience indicated that they had been informed by the concert and the introduction. The project team was able to combine past and present in programming a more recent orchestration of a work that was performed by the Hall&amp;eacute; orchestration during the war. The orchestration was by Colin Matthews and he wrote it for the Hall&amp;eacute; nearly 100 years later. It was a useful way to link past and present and make the concert very relevant for Manchester. Students involved in the concert were informed about the repertoire that had been performed during the war by the Hall&amp;eacute; orchestra. 

This orchestral concert has and will inform a Manchester-Paris Conservatoire project, which will take place in Paris, Manchester and London in 2018. The programmes for the orchestral concerts will be informed by the project and will reflect music performed by the Hall&amp;eacute; during the war.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bdb0ffcb36f6.00776439</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.rncm.ac.uk/uploads/RNCM-Autumn-2016-brochure.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk for Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham (reported by Rachel Duffett)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EDDBCF79-D35E-40EF-ACD0-D0D337CF19A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ca 25 people, including museum volunteers, attended Dr Rachel Duffett's talk on WW1 army food.

Event outline: In the context of the growing sophistication of community archiving, this day-long meeting aims to create a space for discussions about what further initiatives are needed to connect up community archives. 

The day will open with short contributions offering a review of some past initiatives around connecting community archives and what can be learned from these. The afternoon with have a more open format for in-depth attention focused on identifying and addressing current challenges, and how we can take the day's discussions forward, through network grants and other funding opportunities. 
Key questions for the day include:
? How can we connect up different community archives? 
? Can we create shared or collective repositories? 
? Are cloud-based repositories one possible solution?
? What other new infrastructures and standards are needed?
? What can we learn from previous efforts to create infrastructures for connecting community archives?
? What tools, platforms and workarounds are community archives currently using?
? What can we learn from analogous fields - eg the archiving of academic research, the creation of library data repositories? 
? What are the challenges currently facing community archives in developing their facilities and services?
? What are the challenges around ownership, control, access, funding, sustainability and constantly shifting digital worlds?
? What possibilities and demands can be harnessed to scale up the work of community archiving?

The aim for the day is to produce a Position Paper summarising discussions on connecting community archives and to offer a review current funding possibilities for taking any emerging ideas forward.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b00dea8add14.91725655</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meetings with community partners (reported by Jane Chapman)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8278672E-7FB1-42DA-B559-9205A6867AD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Jane Chapman reported meetings between PI and community partners involving travel to south Lincolnshire area.

The trust organised a series of collection days across London where they interviewed the now very elderly children and some grandchildren about their memories of the legacy of the conflict in their families. The project, funded by the HLF, also entailed photographing objects that had been passed down and with which important memories were associated. The information and film have since been uploaded to the Europeana 1914-18 website. The film was very well received by a mixed audience and the screening stimulated a rich discussion which covered both historical and artistic issues. 

Since the event, there has been continued development of links with community groups, e.g. discussions with an attendee from the Essex Records Office has resulted in a close working relationship with the HLF-funded project, 'From the trenches to Tendring'.

The performance was inspired by Everyday Lives in War research. Cap a Pie chose to explore the role of fortune tellers during the First World War and used a University &amp;pound;3000 Sparks Might Fly grant, on-campus creative space and the expertise of the UHArts production team to develop a new piece. 'The Important Man in a White Coat' was premiered at the University's Public Engagement conference in Hatfield on 23 June 2015.

The performance was watched by around 150 people, a mixture of academics from a broad range of disciplines, including Health Sciences, Law, Business, Engineering as well as colleagues from Humanities. The audience also included a Patient Research Group, postgraduate students, local councillors and dignitaries. A film of the piece is available on the Everyday Lives in War Centre website.

By de-familiarizing conventional understandings of science and magic, the piece challenged ideas about what was historically significant in the period 1914-18 and brought little-known stories to wider public notice. The process and outcomes of working with the theatre group gave the researcher fresh insights into his work, and stimulated discussions across the centre team and with research partners.

The Sparks Might Fly model pioneered by the Centre in 2015 will be extended to researchers across the university in 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d958463eb203.56067605</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=1259</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press releases sent to the Centre newsletter (reported by Jane Chapman)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CC65887B-CF0F-496C-8EF0-1CEF2278D4DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Jane Chapman reports two press releases concerning project findings were sent for publication in the Everyday Lives centre's newsletter.

The event was both regional and national; it was attended by anyone associated with Maggie's Centres. This is a charity that supports families that are touched by cancer. 
https://www.maggiescentres.org/culturecrawl/ 

Over 50 people attended this event at the RNCM. The participants and organisers from the Maggie's Centres were fascinated with the musical performance. They were free to sample the music, rest and reflect. They were handed a leaflet informing them of the significance of the work and its link to music-making during WWI at the Royal Manchester College of Music.

Here music served as a form of entertainment, relaxation, meditation for those taking part the fundraising. We were able to discuss our project in more detail with the organisers during the evening. It felt important to be part of this charity event and to communicate aspects of our project to a very different kind of audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bda4d43727c8.90643962</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.rncm.ac.uk/news/rncm-takes-part-charity-culture-crawl/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition at University of Hertfordshire Public Engagement event, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F31AD43C-92C2-4003-82E8-802BFB6DDED4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Julie Moore was invited to attend an exhibition and series of talks on public engagement within a University environment.

Dr Rachel Duffett reported that the collection day was a great success. Sixteen volunteers came forward, an amazing variety of objects were brought along to the event along with some remarkable stories to go with them. 

There were some notable highlights. One interviewee had just a single artefact with him, a scanned image of his father and uncle in uniform; another brought in a crumpled letter that her returned soldier father had written to her when she was on holidays with her mother. Playful and affectionate, it presented a striking contrast to the supposed 'stiff upper lip' of the war generation. The day finished with an interview with a woman whose grandmother had lost her husband whilst she pregnant. 

Those that participated felt pleased that their family stories had been heard and would be shared through future research outputs and via Europeana. The event engaged community participants and enabled further development of the Centre's relationship with the talented team at Age Exchange</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb49738b1a3.77227966</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://everydaylivesinwar.herts.ac.uk/?p=599</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Introduction to HLF funding collaboration with HLF East of England 19.11.16</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0AC08D57-5F28-40DF-9FA0-9FEC993EC24C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Everyday Lives in War, First World War Engagement Centre and the Eastern Region of the Heritage Lottery Fund presented an afternoon of talks and activities on 19.11.16.

Julie Moore &amp;amp; Sarah Lloyd from ELIW introduced the Centre and raised awareness of diverse FWW stories, and how a focus on everyday life can open new perspectives on the conflict. We also discussed ways of creating a permanent record of a community project, and Ciara Meehan (ELIW) shared ideas on negotiating social media. There was also an opportunity to ask questions of HLF staff and to have help with completing an initial enquiry form.

All researchers funded by the centre are working with community groups, heritage organisations and national bodies, including the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Centre has funded an additional 14 collaborative projects to co-produce research on topics lined to the Everyday Lives in War theme. Five of these commenced in early 2017. 

In some cases collaboration takes the form project design (e.g. Roper &amp;amp; Duffett with Lakeside Theatre); in others it involves in-depth research collaboration (e.g. Moore, St Albans). In many instances there is light-touch involvement: e.g. answering queries, giving a talk, providing research materials and introductions. In addition to Researchfish, these activities are detailed on the ELIW website and through regular reports to the AHRC. 

The team has also been committed to outreach, bringing the theme of everyday life to people who may not have previously expressed an interest in the centenary (e.g. Bletchley Park Roadshow; HLF showcase). During 2016, the Centre continued to deliver workshops around specific research topics, including military tribunals and resistance to war.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0D96A091-BF9D-4E57-8EEA-5393B4B6A7A1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460caf9c5c481.88719943</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Centre has now completed Phase 1.
