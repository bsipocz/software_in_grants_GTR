Triterpenes are one of the largest classes of plant-derived natural products. They protect plants against pests and diseases and are also important as drugs and anticancer agents. Arabidopsis and cereals such as rice do not make protective triterpene glycosides. These species are therefore excellent experimental systems for proof-of-concept experiments involving metabolic engineering of triterpene pathways into heterologous species. The aim of this proposal is to engineer triterpene metabolic pathways into Arabidopsis and rice by genetic modification, using recombineering and synthetic biology. At the end of this project we will have the necessary knowledge to devise strategies to introduce multiple genes into diverse plant species for control of plant pests and diseases based on synthesis of protective triterpenes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118711</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SAW workshop at Barford Primary School 11 March 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BCD9F713-8DDA-4BC6-B195-BE6A6D30964A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Saw (Science, Art and Writing) project in Barford primary school together with Jenni Rant, Gemma Farr&amp;eacute; Martinez, James Reed, Chris Hann (artist) and Mike O'Driscoll (writer).

The image library has the potential to attract new traffic to the NRP institute websites and research group homepages and will allow groups such as the media, schools, the general public and other researchers to gain a glimpse of the great depth and diversity of research that is being carried out in Norwich. Although all the images are freely available to download and use, people are required to sign up to use the library and are asked to enter information at the time of download about their intended use of the image. This helps to capture who is using the library and where the images are being used. So far images have been downloaded 582 times and have been used in presentations, publications, on websites, for education and advertising. We ran an image competition to raise awareness across the NRP site and then assembled a judging panel to select the top 12 images which were used to create an NRP calendar for 2016. The calendar was sent to politicians, business leaders, industry and academics at institutions in the UK and internationally. The competition featured in the local paper, the Eastern Daily Press and an overall winner was picked and used to make a large canvas which is hanging in the new Centrum building. We have received many positive comments about the libraries ease of use for finding good quality, copyright free images to use in presentations from fellow researchers across the site. In October 2016 we put on a two-week, large scale image exhibition at the Forum in Norwich as part of the first Norwich Science Festival. The images attracted a lot of interest and several artists have been in touch with scientists whose research images were on display to set up new collaborations using science to inform artistic practice. We will post outcomes of these endeavours onto the image library website to widen our exposure to new audiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda59d056da6.17761102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://images.norwichresearchpark.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has contributed to the generation of a customised toolkit of genes and enzymes for metabolic engineering of triterpene synthesis in plants.

These promoters have been patented and licensed to academic researchers and to industry.

Triterpenes are one of the largest classes of plant-derived natural products. These compounds protect plants against pests and diseases and they are also important as drugs and anticancer agents. Arabidopsis and cereals such as rice and maize do not make triterpene glycosides, which are associated with protection against pests and diseases. These plants were therefore excellent experimental systems for proof of concept experiments involving metabolic engineering of the triterpene pathway into heterologous species. Within this project we have established a customised toolkit of genes and enzymes for metabolic engineering of triterpene synthesis in plants and validated this toolkit by heterologous expression of single and multiple triterpene biosynthetic genes in Nicotiana benthamiana. We have also demonstrated the production of triterpene scaffolds in Arabidopsis and rice. We have developed sets of domesticated regulatory and coding sequences for plant engineering. Importantly, we have also shown that the promoters from a root-expressed pathway in oat can be used to drive the co-ordinate expression of multiple genes in roots of other plant species.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The triterpene toolkit that we have generated represents a valuable resource for engineering of high value compounds in plants. The Leaf Systems technology developed at the John Innes Centre has proved very powerful in enabling us to produce hundreds of milligrams and even up to a gram of triterpene using this transient plant expression system. This opens the way for engineering of high value compounds in plants using synthetic biology approaches. We have also recently published on a proposed common plant syntax for plant synthetic biology, i.e. a universal design format that will enable the exchange of parts, which will accelerate the ability of the community to engineer new plant metabolic pathways and other traits of commercial importance</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>66F7E3D1-FAEB-4B16-B4B8-67A5D184B58E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7459294778.36768290</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Creative Economy,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.jic.ac.uk/directory/anne-osbourn/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/J/000CA516</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
