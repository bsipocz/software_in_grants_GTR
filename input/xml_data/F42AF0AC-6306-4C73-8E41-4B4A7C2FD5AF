The focus of academic and media discussion so far has been on the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the Bush administration also undertook many other smaller military interventions around the world as part of the 'war on terror.' These interventions took place in locations including the Horn of Africa, Georgia and the Caspian Sea region, the Philippines and the countries across the Sahara region including Mali, Niger, Chad and Mauritania in West Africa. These interventions were part of a global counter-terrorism strategy that encompassed not only conventional warfare--as in Iraq and Afghanistan--but also what the Bush administration called 'war in countries we are not at war with.' By this it meant unconventional small scale operations that would be carried out primarily by Special Operations Forces rather than conventional military forces. This research will examine these interventions to present a more complete picture of the Bush administration's response to 9/11 and the ensuing 'Global War on Terror,' as the administration began to refer to it.\n\nIn doing so, this work invokes the Cold War strategic framework of the 'core' and the 'periphery.' During the Cold War, US policy makers used this framework with regard to Soviet communism: the 'core' region was the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites, and the 'periphery' was the developing world (such as Vietnam), where the US was engaged in a competition for influence with the Soviet Union. The premise of this work is that the 'core' countries of the 'war on terror' remain Afghanistan and Iraq but that, for reasons of both security and political expediency, the 'war on terror' became a global framework that reached well beyond those two countries and encompassed 'peripheral' regions too. The project will consider the diplomatic, economic, military and intelligence dimensions of these 'peripheral' interventions and, in doing so, it will offer new conclusions about the nature and scope of the 'war on terror' and US foreign policy after 9/11. It will examine the way in which the Bush administration moved from viewing terrorism as a 'state-sponsored' phenomenon--the rationale used to justify the invasion of Iraq--to viewing it in some regions of the world as a transnational problem that was not confined to the borders of one state but which crossed borders and was not necessarily sponsored by any particular state. It will consider the way in which the administration sought to tackle this transnational threat: by using Special Operations Forces and unconventional warfare techniques (as opposed to conventional military forces) on the 'periphery.' It will also offer new perspectives on the Bush administration's foreign policy more broadly, including the extent to which there was a guiding framework that transcended the 'war on terror'--in other words: do these interventions in 'peripheral' regions show that counter-terrorism was the sole purpose of the Bush foreign policy or was it guided by other interests too? The project will consider the extent to which these operations on the 'periphery'--which were undertaken (and received funding) as counter-terrorism operations--were advantageous in other ways that often transcended the 'war on terror.' In many cases, these deployments coincided with the existence of long-standing or newly identified strategic interests, which were vital to what policy makers perceived as America's global primacy. This research will examine the way in which counterterrorism became part of a broader global strategy aimed at preserving America's primacy in every region of the world, not just the Middle East. Finally, the study will also briefly consider the Obama administration's continuation--and in some cases escalation--of many of the Bush administration's operations in these periphal regions, even as Obama looks to wind down the war in Iraq.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is considerable potential for this project to make an impact beyond academia. This work is timely, original and very relevant to contemporary international relations since it deals with events and phenomena that are ongoing. (The project will conclude by examining the Obama administration's continuation--and in some cases escalation--of many of the Bush administration's operations in peripheral regions.) The contemporary nature of the subject matter means that the findings from the project can be targeted at key journals that are widely read not only by academics but also by policy makers in the US and UK. Such journals include International Affairs (where I already have an article under review) and Survival, both of which reach an international audience, which is not limited to academia. There is real potential, then, for this work to make a contribution towards contemporary political discourse and to begin challenging the existing narrative of the 'war on terror' through highlighting overlooked cases of intervention that are set to continue even as the US and UK begin to wind down the war in Iraq. In other words, the research will emphasise ways in which there is continuity in US foreign policy between Bush and Obama.\n Once I begin my first semester of School-supported research leave, I will begin to disseminate material from the project via my page on the School's web site. This will serve as a focal point for other interested academics and lay people. It will include an explanation of the Global War on Terror project, links to some of the key unclassified documents from the Bush administration, links to articles that I have written on the subject and posts from myself based on information uncovered through this research. The objective of this website is to create a space where interested non-academics can find out about the war on terror on the periphery and provide some information and links that they can follow up themselves.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48641</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My book sheds new light on the following:

- The United States 'war on terror' in Africa, the Philippines, and Central Asia. It therefore examines the 'war on terror' as a phenomenon that was global in scope rather than just regional (i.e. Middle East-based).

- It explains why these particular regions became 'fronts' in Washington's 'war on terror' - in other words, what was the combination of interests that made these particular regions important to Washington after 9/11?

- It offers a new interpretation of US defence policy in the 21st century, in particular the development of capabilities in 'irregular warfare' - meaning unconventional or asymmetric types of conflict, as opposed to conventional state vs. state warfare. I demonstrate that US policy makers believed that, in the 21st century, irregular challenges such as terrorism and insurgency would become much more common. Thus in order for the United States to retain its position as the world's preeminent power, it was essential to complement its existing strengths in conventional warfare with new capabilities in irregular warfare. The Department of Defense referred to this as &amp;quot;full spectrum dominance&amp;quot; - meaning dominance across the entire spectrum of warfare from conventional through to irregular conflict.</gtr:description><gtr:id>76D30AC8-52AC-40D3-AC97-94D25ABD18F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56a8cdb15e1830.59034246</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I00274X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
