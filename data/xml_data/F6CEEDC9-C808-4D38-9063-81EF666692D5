appliances using novel technology based on magnets and magnetic materials. This technology
has been developed at Camfridge and with our partners over the last 5 years.
In both developed markets and developing countries energy usage is increasingly subject to
intense regulatory scrutiny. In temperate climates cooling consumes 15% of all generated
electricity, rising to 45% in hot climates. The domestic fridge consumes between 5% and 8%
of all generated electricity. In fossil fuel based cars up to 10% of fuel consumption is
associated with passenger cooling; indeed in electric vehicles this rises to 50% in extreme
conditions (for either heating or cooling).
New regulatory regimes are being structured to promote the development of energy efficient
and gas free appliances. Camfridge technology will enable appliance manufacturers to comply
cost-effectively with these increasingly stringent requirements.
Magnetic cooling technology is sufficiently developed to enable the next generation of high
efficiency domestic refrigerators helping our customers to meet the new A+++ standard in a
cost effective manner. This project will develop concepts for the next generation of highly
efficient AMR designs. By increasing cooling power, through increasing operating frequency,
rather than increasing the amount of refrigerant, and thus maintaining cost, weight and size,
Camfridge technology can meet the needs of higher power cooling applications massively
expanding our market potential.
The payoff from a successful project, coupled with Camfridge?s existing market and
technology development, could have a significant impact in three key markets. In particular:
? Electric Vehicles. Enable efficient heating and cooling in electric vehicles, extending the
battery and thus operating range of these vehicles, key for their commercial success.
? Conventional cars. Help conventional car manufacturers better comply with new automotive
energy efficiency regulations that will require fuel efficiency to be measured with climate
control turned on.
? Commercial cooling. Help reduce refrigerant leakage and the energy efficiency of
standalone appliances in the commercial sector (which is facing new regulations).
The timeliness is ideal. The first generation EV market is not projected to significantly grow
until 2015, the automotive energy efficiency regulation is expected from 2016, and the EU
energy efficiency Directive (2010/30/EC), which is only now creating the A+++ domestic
fridge category, will progressively extend energy efficiency requirements to the commercial
sector over the next few years.
The most interesting market, representing a new and high growth opportunity is climate
control for electric vehicles.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710049</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
