The partnership with the Migration Museum Project (MMP) brings together this diverse body of research and disseminates it to public. It is important to consider British migration as a historical and ongoing, dynamic and dual process of outward and inward migration. Knowledge transfer from social science academics to the MMP on this topic will therefore address this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The objectives of the scheme are designed to achieve these outcomes in a focused way across a period of six months. Beginning with an&amp;nbsp; academic and MMP workshop and then working with social scientists existing research and professional museum curators and cultural heritage practitioners, an attractive and engaging online exhibition and learning resource will be created focused on 'The British Diaspora: Histories, Lives and Identities of the British Abroad'. This will include case studies from different countries/regions, pictures, stories and links to further research and resources. The online exhibition and learning resource will draw directly from existing social science research and reflects the different geographical, disciplinary and methodological approaches of the academic network.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This knowledge exchange proposal is designed to secure maximum impact of current research on the British Diaspora and the lives, histories and identities of the British abroad. The proposed knowledge exchange scheme's partnership with the Migration Museum Project (MMP) will enable existing academic research on the British diaspora/British outward migration to reach relevant cultural heritage sector and the wider public beyond. Making impact in this area is important because there is a need for understanding the contemporary and historical dynamics of inward and outward UK migration. At present cultural heritage sector and other 'non-academic' resources on inward migration are much better covered than on outward migration and settlement. The MMP can work with museums, cultural heritage bodies and communities to reinterpret existing collections. Whereas, there has been a growth of social science academic research focused on outward migration and the lives and identities of the British abroad, this is not matched by collections on outward migration in the cultural heritage sector. Public understanding and public debates about the dynamics and history of British migration reflect this gap and predominantly focus on inward migration.The knowledge exchange scheme will fill this gap for the MMP, who will be able to connect with not only the cultural heritage sector, but also relevant school, media, law and policy communities. The outcome of an online exhibition and learning resource will be invaluable for teachers, university and school students, as well as to members of the public interested in migration, family history and of course, the 5.9 million British citizens who live abroad. This is an achievable ambition and well within the scope of available funding. 
There will be a number of beneficiaries from this project. The first will be the MMP, who are a charity comprised of volunteers from the cultural heritage, law and policy sectors and aim to create the first National Museum of Migration. The knowledge exchange proposal will create a productive synergy between the academic network and the member of the MMP, the outcome of which will be the curation and creation of an online exhibition and learning resource focused on the British diaspora and covering the history and contemporary extent of outward British migration. The first step in this knowledge exchange process will be a two day workshop to be held at Loughborough University and attended by relevant academics working on this area, members of the MMP and also relevant museum curators, cultural heritage sector and other interested participants. 
The second phase of impact will be the curation of the online exhibition and learning resource which will be hosted by the website of the MMP. It will be possible to use pictures, stories, relationships with objects, animals, food and everyday life to highlight, create understanding and help people reflect on the history and continuing relevance of British emigration and the 'British Diaspora'. Academic network members will be encouraged to use podcasts, images and draw directly from their research. The website would include not only extracts of existing research, but also link to the further publications of the academic network members, the location and extent of existing archives and online resources relating to British emigration. This will be an attractive, professionally produced and engaging resource for the public, media and school and university students.
On completion of the online exhibition and learning resource a high profile public event and reception, hosted by the MMP and held at the Royal Commonwealth Society, London will be held with a maximum number of 100 attendees. The MMP will use its extensive database and media contacts to publicise this launch.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12116</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The knowledge exchange was first between the academic network and the members of the MMP (drawn from cultural heritage, policy, legal and political communities) and then to the MMPs supporters network and more broadly the wider public via the internet.

In 2015, the MMP will hold a public event to discuss British emigration and key members of the academic network will speak at that event. This will further publicise the project, the online resource and achieve knowledge transfer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The MMP will maintain the online resource, there is possibility for the website to be added to and developed in future and the MMP can draw from the material for any future exhibitions or events. Also, by clearly highlighting the scholarship of the academic network and providing links to further publications and contact details. There is opportunity for the academics in the project to be contacted by members of the public, policy communities and the media. Individual members of the academic network are already exploring opportunities for future collaboration with the MMP. For example, Professor Karen O'Reilly is organising an exhibition about British emigration to be held in Hong Kong in 2015 and has involved the MMP in these preparations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BCE52722-524A-4FC6-8A06-1B8713977D94</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546476720869e8.56778703</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.britishemigration.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C086311F-09CE-4A55-91AC-5158579FF62C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Migration, Space and Transnational Identities: The British in South Africa</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6176f925a75e3cbf9e108b990c5fba4d"><gtr:id>6176f925a75e3cbf9e108b990c5fba4d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Conway D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781137319135</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58c6be61881390.71511397</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005367/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
