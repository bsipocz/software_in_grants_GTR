Values for manufacturers are changing from production to technological knowhow and design; ownership models are changing from outright ownership to collaborative and long term partnership; media are continuing their shift from physical to digital; there is an increasing focus on distribution of work and service; and the partnership between the manufacturing sector and the technology sector is increasingly key. This shift is taking place in the societal and business context of the UK in the 21st Century. In order to harness the potential from this shift, the changes in human skills, capabilities and working environments needs to be considered, alongside the development and change in business models that underpin industry and innovation. 
European colleagues have responded to this notion with a systems approach by coining the term 'Industrie 4.0'(or Industry 4.0). Changes to future industrial systems in the digital age demands funded research in order to ensure that the UK is well placed within an international context to respond to the challenges presented from industry and to implement new science and engineering into real world systems as quickly and effectively as possible. 
This proposal outlines a Network Plus activity that will bring together core colleagues from the Manufacturing, Digital Economy, Design, Human Factors and Business communities to build new collaborations between leading academics and industry partners. The network will move beyond Industry 4.0 to develop new 'state of the art' perspectives on future industrial systems, which will encompass technology advances, and human, business and social perspectives, to ensure a full understanding of the realities of implementing digital technologies into future industrial systems. There will be a particular focus on ensuring that challenges addressed within the Network Plus are driven by the current and future industrial context. 
The Network Plus will a) identify relevant elements from these existing activities to conduct international benchmarking and establish the UK lead in specific elements of relevance to Future Industrial Systems in the Digital Age; b) enhance cross-sectorial learning; and c) identify new, discipline-bridging, agenda-setting opportunities for feasibility studies leading to scientific insight and future funding applications from national and international funders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Network Plus will generate impact for the following groups:
- Industry: through new knowledge generated in feasibility studies, including new insight into data sets examined via feasibility studies, new partnerships formed through industry participation in networking events, new research potentially directly funded by industry, and competitive advantage both for specific industrial network participant and industry within the UK as a whole. Industry will benefit through participation in Network Plus events, supporting academic placements in industry, and feasibility studies, and through the resources produced by the Network Plus, including a road map and accessible demonstrations of Future Industrial Systems in a Digital Age. These outputs will help industry identify suitable collaboration partners for future research, and determine opportunities for investment in new technologies. 
- Policy makers: through identification of key challenges and opportunities for the UK in future industrial systems, demonstration of potential technologies to be deployed within industrial settings, and prioritisation of requirements for research and capital investment, and use of the road map produced as part of the Network Plus which will identifies strengths and opportunities for UK industry and academia for future Industrial Systems in the Digital Age. This will enable them to decide on financial priorities, encourage partnerships between key industrial and academic stakeholders, and influence standards and regulatory frameworks. 
- General public: through new insight into the future notions that will be embedded in digitally-led industrial systems. This will be achieved through accessible dissemination resources such as videos.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1003586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Network Plus Kick Off Meeting (Oct 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F713CFA-8C39-460B-B0F6-1AD35A996613</gtr:id><gtr:impact>59 delegates representing UK universities, Catapults and industry attended the Network Plus kick off event on 17 October 2016.
