England</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L013975/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Domesday Book (DB) is one of England's most important historical documents: arguably the nation's single most significant record. In 1086 William I's commissioners set out to record the taxable assets of the newly acquired kingdom, settlement by settlement and county by county. Without the account of the survey preserved in DB we would know almost nothing of the social fabric of rural England in the eleventh century, of its landscape and resources and their monetary value; we could not map secular and ecclesiastical lordship, and neither could we estimate the scale of resources available to the ruling elite. DB in itself it constitutes remarkable testimony to the reach of central government. However DB is a much truncated version of other records generated by the Domesday survey of 1086 which served as its source. Only one collection of such records is extant: Exon Domesday (EDB), which survives in its original form, and contains vital evidence relating to the way the survey was conducted and recorded. The aim of this project is to publish the contents of EDB for the first time and to unlock the evidence which the book contains for the conduct of the survey at both local and central level. 
In 2011 the manuscript's 1816 binding was removed, permitting photography and detailed technical examination. The project will create a series of freely available electronic resources for the use of the scholarly community and the general public, including text, translation and a digital facsimile or `virtual codex'. This last item will pioneer an innovation in digital codicology which will allow users to rearrange the units of the volume and so to reconstitute its contents in different orders: unlike other DB texts the true order of EDB remains a matter of controversy. A detailed examination of the composition of the book and a reconstruction of its creation and history will be published in printed form as a permanent record of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The current project is designed to reach users across and beyond the English-speaking world by making available on the web in a global language the evidence of a text whose importance is widely recognized beyond the immediate scholarly fields of the project team. 
1. The English translation and, for university users, the printed Companion, have the potential to have a transformative effect on the study of the Norman Conquest at university and school level by providing pedagogical materials. The study of EDB promises to reveal much about the conduct of royal and local government and the structure of local society and to shed new light on GDB, an existing curriculum text. The relational database constitutes a research tool for projects and dissertations, as does the translation. 
2. The text and translation will enable local and family historians to research south-western localities and families in a manner hitherto impossible because the detailed evidence of EDB was simply unavailable. 
3. Cathedral talks across southern England and the Arts and Humanities festival in London will bring the researchers into contact with interested members of the public and will attract the interest of local press and so further publicise the project and its findings. The project contributes to the cultural life of the locality and sheds light on an important period in national history.
4. The publicity surrounding the project, and the research findings of its members, will significantly affect the profile of Exeter cathedral inside and outside the locality. Until recently, the custodians of the manuscript were unaware of its full importance. The web presence of the project and its outputs will bring tourists and school parties to the cathedral. 
5. The Dean and Chapter will use the images generated by the project to create educational materials, such as a printed facsimile for use in the visitor centre. 
6. As a draw for visitors Exon has applications for tourism and can be used by local institutions, such as the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, whose activities are already linked with the outreach activities of the Cathedral. All these elements (4.-6.) promise to have an economic impact for the cathedral and museum in Exeter, in increased visitor numbers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>829808</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Law School</gtr:department><gtr:description>Draft entry: XRF scanning and microscopy of the Exon Domesday Manuscript</gtr:description><gtr:id>A855F620-949E-4CAB-A089-32BDF623DB44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication is planned.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d01adaee75b4.35425569-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Scientific investigation of the chemical composition of the spearhead stain and ink; experimentation with the use of an Axiovert high-resolution microscope for analysis of parchment and ink.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Analysis of spearhead image in the manuscript was one of our research questions at the time of application.

The event organizer reported afterwards
Dear Chris
I am most grateful to you for all the trouble you took to be with us at the Museum of Somerset yesterday and for providing us with such a fine and illuminating lecture about the Geld Inquest and Exon Domesday. I know from what others have said to me how much your lecture was appreciated. The fact that we could have sold twice as many tickets if we'd had the room is a testimony to how much Exon Domesday has captured people's imagination. The exhibition has also been a great success (more than the Becket Casket last year) and I am very grateful for all that your contribution has added. Thank you once again for your kindness in agreeing to give the lecture. It is very much appreciated by us all. I look forward to seeing the outcomes of your research in published form.

Email from organiser Zarah King (zarah.king@cabinetoffice.gov.uk) after the event:

Good morning,

I just wanted to say a massive thank you for taking part in our History Week.

I hope you enjoyed the experience, I know the talk went down very well with those attending, I must say the facts were great, I passed on the names you gave such as Humphrey Goldenbollocks to my sister who did history at uni and she absolutely loved hearing that, it makes history that bit more real in a way.

Many thanks again and if there is anything you need in the future etc please just let me know.

Kind regards
Zarah


And from Jonathan Heath (jonathan.heath@culture.gov.uk), an attendee.


Hi Lois,

I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed your talk on Domesday at the Treasury today - it was very informative and interesting to understand how past governments attempted ambitious projects.

Thanks also for answering my questions on intentional under-reporting and the extent to which Domesday exploited the existing highly developed bureaucracy of the English state.

Many discoveries have been made about how the Domesday survey was conducted and how the book was made. The scribal hands have been described and enumerated. We have new data with implications for the timing and conduct of the Domesday Survey, suggesting that Exon Domesday was completed within a matter of months of the commissioning of the survey in December 1086. The new Latin edition of the text makes plain that the pre-existing edition, of 1816, was faulty. The new English translation, the first ever of Exon Domesday, will make the text full available to a general audience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have plans for 6 regional talks to take place soon after our research findings have been substantiated and after the launch of our website in September 2017. The exhibition at the Museum of Somerset (February to April 2017), which arose from the project's Knolwedge transfer board and draws on the project's translation of the text and palaeographical description, has generated considerable local interest among the general public, attracting increased visitor numbers. Members of the general public will be able to access Exon Domesday using our website. We are planning to write a short booklet to interpret Exon Domesday for the general public and to bring our conclusions to a wide audience. The plan is that the booklet will be used and made available for sale by the custodians of the manuscript. Other spin-offs are expected or planned, for example, future exhibitions at Exeter Cathedral Library and in the locality, demonstrations to schools and other members of the public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E22B9A24-1E82-41A7-B254-2D4CADFF890F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dde0b3046847.75962342</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.exondomesday.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The DigiPal framework was originally developed for the ERC-funded DigiPal project but has received significant extensions and improvements through the AHRC-funded 'Conqueror's Commissioners' and 'Models of Authority' projects.
