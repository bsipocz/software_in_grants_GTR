Nevertheless, little critical attention has been paid to the most fiercely contested region of the archipelago, the north of Ireland. A series of related crises unfold in Ulster throughout the course of the seventeenth century, including the almost total disappearance of aristocratic Gaelic culture, the Anglo-Scottish Plantation, the Rising of 1641, and the Siege of Derry. As an archipelagic context makes clear, these are not insular phenomena but are instead related to the ongoing religious and political upheavals across the island grouping. But the footprint left on English literature by the Ulster crises of the seventeenth century has not to date been investigated in a rigorous manner. \n\nThis project aims to explore both the English-language texts written or circulated in seventeenth-century Ulster, and those which comment on the situation from other regions of the archipelago. In doing so, it aims both to elucidate in more detail the relationship between literary production and the various identities forged along political, religious and ethnic lines in Ulster, and to examine the political significance of literary engagements with the Ulster crises in other parts of the archipelago. \n\nThe monograph will consist of seven chapters. Chapter One, 'Introduction: Archipelagic Regions / Localising Ulster,' will serve as a theoretical and methodological introduction to the monograph. Chapter Two, 'Staging the O'Neill: The Nine Years War and the Flight of the Earls,' will examine the large body of texts concerning the controversial figure of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. Plays and poems beyond Shakespeare's Henry V engage with O'Neill and the Nine Years War; moreover, most critics have failed to engage in detail with O'Neill's Jacobean exploits, including his flight from Ireland, and attempts to raise continental military support. Chapter Three, 'Planting Empir(e)icism: Writing the Ulster Plantation,' will pay attention to the texts composed around 1609-10 - including the work of Francis Bacon, Thomas Blenerhasset, John Speed, and the fashion for British Romance on the London stage - to argue that the Plantation of Ulster left a greater mark on metropolitan English literary culture than has hitherto been realised. Chapter Four, 'Episcopal Identities: Archipelagic Armagh,' will examine in detail seventeenth-century disputes about the cultural and ecclesiastical centrality of the city of Armagh to the province of Ulster and the island of Ireland. Chapter Five, 'Bringing Milton to a Head: The Aftermath of 1641,' will build on the growing recognition among Milton scholars that the representation of the rebellion of Lucifer in Paradise Lost is in part conditioned by Milton's reaction to the 1641 rising in Ulster. Chapter Six, 'Sieging the Initiative: London-Derry and the Anglo-Irish,' will examine literary representations of, and reactions to, the Siege of Derry. Critics have too frequently made the mistake of treating the Siege of Derry as a primal scene, as the beginning of a set of political relationships in the archipelago. This chapter aims to shift the critical emphasis by relocating the literary response to the Siege in the context of the seventeenth-century Ulster genre of 'crisis narrative'. Chapter Seven, 'Epilogue: Redefining the Ulster Canon,' will argue that critics of Ulster literature have, perhaps understandably, been distracted by the political crises of the twentieth century, particularly Partition and 'the troubles': as such, the canon of Ulster literature has been unnecessarily foreshortened. This chapter willargue that the notion of &amp;quot;Ulster literature&amp;quot; has a longer, though less traumatic, history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries of the proposed research include:\n\nThe UK government's Department for Media, Culture and Sport. The Department has responsibility for 28 UNESCO World Heritage sites, only one of which - the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast - is located in Ulster. A thorough examination of Anglophone literature relating to Ulster in the seventeenth century may well shed light on how early moderns viewed this unique geological feature. Evidence which arises over the course of this project will be offered to the DMCS, for potential use in informational/promotional contexts.\n\nThe Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI). The ACNI's current five-year strategy includes the commitment to 'highlight ways in which the arts and artists can play a role in addressing issues such as racism, discrimination and sectarianism'. The focus of this research project on the relationship between literary production and the development of ethnic and sectarian identities in early modern Ulster has the potential to provide a research-informed historical backdrop to the contemporary work of ACNI. Contact will be made with ACNI to explore ways in which this research project may make a positive contribution to the current strategic priorities.\n\nThe National Library of Scotland (NLS). The NLS has significant archival holdings relevant to this project, due in large part to the close cultural links between Ulster and Scotland. The 'digital library' section of its website contains a number of publicly accessible 'web features' related to the library collections; none of these, however, examine the relationship between Scotland and Ulster. The applicant will approach the NLS to explore potential interest in developing such an exhibition, given the significance of the library's holdings.\n\nThe Ulster Museum. The Ulster Museum, part of the National Museums of Northern Ireland consortium, includes in its print collection an important series of Dutch engravings charting the progress of the Williamite wars of 1688-91. While these are already publicised as one of the Museum's high-profile holdings, the work undertaken as part of this research fellowship will allow for an archipelagic reading of these continental depictions of seventeenth-century Ulster. Contact will be made with the Ulster Museum to explore the possibility of integrating some of the research findings of this project into display material/published catalogues, and/or arranging a temporary exhibition devoted to print culture in the late seventeenth-century conflicts. \n\nThe Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI). To an even greater extent than the NLS, PRONI possesses a wealth of resources relevant to the study of the literature of seventeenth-century Ulster - and, by implication, to the 'archipelagic' study of early modern Britain and Ireland - including significant quantities of manuscript resources unavailable elsewhere. But there exists no permanent exhibition - physical or virtual - related to the political and cultural crises of the seventeenth century. Again, the applicant will approach PRONI to discuss any interest in developing such an exhibition.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33330</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I001719/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
