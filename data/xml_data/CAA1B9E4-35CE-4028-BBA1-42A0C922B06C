This initiative will be delivered through C8 - a collaboration of eight leading professional bodies involved in the construction and operation of the built environment and infrastructure in the UK and overseas. The eight bodies are the: Association for Project Management (APM), British Institute of Facilities Management, (BIFM) Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE - the lead applicant), Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB), Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE), Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). 
C8 brings engagement with the widest range of senior industry specialists actively engaged in the development of the digital plan of work, classification and the other elements of the Level 2 BIM delivery framework. The C8 approach involves wide contacts and connections with all aspects of the infrastructure, built environment and operational industries, with groups, organisations and individuals across the whole supply chain, as well as the members of the C8 institutions as key stakeholders and as customers for the data cube and associated products and services.
id3 aims to deliver a clear, holistic definition of the ?digital data cube?, defining ?what needs doing?, to what level of detail, by whom and when for all stages of projects and operation, providing a coherent integrated approach for the whole built environment, covering the whole life of the infrastructure asset or building.
This will enable application to organisations with single assets or portfolios, to asset management programmes and individual projects of all sizes ? while maintaining and respecting the disciplines and directions of Level 2 BIM. C8 specifically aims to enable cross-sectoral, multi-professional, industry-wide collaboration to support the transition of construction, infrastructure and built environment sectors in the UK to a digital, data driven economy and to give their 450,000 members and other stakeholders in the UK and approximately 100 other countries the knowledge, guidance and professional recognition and development needed to operate in this new business environment. 
Phase 1 will deliver a detailed specification for the Digital Plan of Work (dPoW) and classification system (CS) and their integration with the existing elements of the level 2 framework. It will also provide a clear business plan and specification for the platform required to deliver the dPoW and the full id3 vision through Phase 2.
Phase 2 will coordinate and consolidate the seven elements making up BIM Level 2, including the BS 1192 series, contract protocols and Government Soft Landings (GSL), as well as the newly developed definitive digital Plan of Work and Classification System. This will be delivered through the web, available free of charge and maintained and developed over a 5 year period, on a stable, resilient platform.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">972190</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
