Focusing primarily on the French colonial settlers from Algeria repatriated en masse to France as refugees in 1962, it will expose the roots of France's most urgent current social issues, demonstrating how the settlers are part of a longer, connected history of the Mediterranean, in which questions of culture define the experience of refugees and the response of host societies. This is the first systematic study in English of representations of and by the French settlers of Algeria in a relational framework joining the fields of settler colonialism, and refugee and diaspora studies. Furthermore, it will bring together academics, artists and professionals to analyse comparatively the experiences of Algeria's settlers together with refugees fleeing former settler colonies and post-war situations in Germany, Angola, ex-Yugoslavia, and those having recently crossed the Mediterranean from Syria. Evidence-based academic analysis of the experiences of forced migration presented in an accessible form is now urgently needed to foster public understanding, and the findings will be widely disseminated in a broad range of accessible media.

The community of settler origin repatriated in 1962 has been a powerful political lobby in calling for a positive assessment of the nation's colonial past, a sensitive subject in France even today. To fully grasp the impact of the colonial past on present-day society, this population must also be understood relationally, as they cannot be not easily categorised. They were French citizens but many had non-French origins and had never visited France; they were regarded as exploitative colonisers, but most were primarily working-class who became refugees; they were white Catholics but spoke a North African patois and were regarded with suspicion by French mainlanders. The project will address this paradoxical dimension by examining the community through the prism of two distinct fields of study: 1) settler colonialism, a burgeoning field of primarily Anglophone study which has been little applied to French colonial history; and 2) refugee and forced migration studies, which emphasise that the post-displacement identity of a community is shaped by the experience of host country reception, and exile. This will also be explored in a broader timeframe from the colonization of Algeria by pioneers from across Europe, through the forced migrations of twentieth-century Europe, to the current Mediterranean migrant crisis. The project will 1) map and evaluate the traces of Algerian settler colonial culture within mainstream French culture; 2) identify the contextual and relational factors which shape the experience of migration for both settler refugees and the host society and 3) set the repatriation of Algerian settlers within a wider context of Mediterranean migration. These will be achieved through interdisciplinary analysis of a range of cultural representations including witness testimony, literature, film, graphic novels, autobiography, print media, documentary, campaigning websites and music in order to examine how this community make sense of their own experiences, and the host country's response. The project leads the development of the emerging field of settler colonial studies, and also provides new directions in studies of refugees and forced migrants, contributing to scholarship on questions of national identity, memory, diaspora, nostalgia, state authority and political violence, trauma, melancholy, terrorism, religion, and intergenerational transmission of memory. Working with a range of museum, artistic, local government and academic partners and practitioners, the outputs will communicate the contextualised testimonies of former settlers and refugees to the public, with the aim of fostering understanding of the experiences of migration and integration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the post-war period, the phenomena of colonisation and Mediterranean migration to Europe have proved enduringly contentious issues, associated with a range of assumptions which have proved remarkably persistent. The project will work to destabilize the categories of victim/perpetrator associated with Mediterranean displacements, replacing them with a more nuanced understanding, by communicating in an accessible form the academic analysis of France's Algerian settlers. By presenting them in a context which relates them to the current Mediterranean refugee crisis, it will challenge the common assumptions about those trying to enter Europe, using a range of media forms to encourage us to listen to their stories and to see them as individuals situated in and reacting to complex historical circumstances. 

Local art gallery visitors and the University community will benefit from: 

1. An exhibition, 'Experiences of Exile', to take place at the Pathfoot Art Gallery, Stirling. The exhibition will present the 1962 experience of repatriation of France's settlers in Algeria through visual media (photography, video installation, filmed and subtitled testimony, and art), loaned period artefacts, supported by academic analysis. Similar testimony and visual media (photography, video installation, filmed testimony) of the Syrian refugees currently arriving in Europe will also be presented, to prompt viewer reconsideration of the way in which these refugees are categorized.

2. Interdisciplinary responses to the exhibition:
 a. A commissioned artwork produced in response
 b. Original Creative Writing pieces and created by postgraduate students taking Stirling's M.Litt in Creative Writing 
 c. Original short films by Honours students studying Video Production

3. A Public Art Lecture on the subject of Mediterranean migration by Professor Alison Phipps OBE.

Communities across the central belt of Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling) will have access to 

4. A special season of films on the two case-studies of the refugee crossings of the Mediterranean, each with an introduction by the PI, to be shown as part of the French Film Festival, UK.

Local government officials working to resettle Syrian refugees and members of the general public interested in learning about experiences of migration and integration of refugees arriving in France and the UK, and in developments in contemporary Europe will benefit from accessible scholarly research presented through a range of online resources:

5. An open-access online Digital Humanities 'Story-telling Soundscapes' website, hosting a compilation of oral testimonies in the form of brief stories and recollections, available as a series of short podcasts. This will enable the voices and memories of an ageing generation of settlers to be captured and heard more widely, together with the testimonies of recently arrived refugees from Syria.

6. An open-access online Digital Cartography of migration, comprising video, sound recordings, photography and visual images of sites and experiences of migration, between Algeria and France, and Syria and Europe.

7. A blog to be hosted on the project website, which will provide details and news about the project stages, interviews with academics and curators involved, and link to the Story-telling Soundscapes and Digital Cartographies sites. 

For local government and NGOs involved in resettling Syrian refugees, the project will provide a relational study of a previous wave of Mediterranean refugees, and a diachronic record of the perceptions of France's Algerian settlers and their evolution over time. In addition to academic analysis of the testimony from recently arrived Syrian refugees, local government will also benefit from a broader understanding of the integration process, and the means employed by a migrant diaspora to create a sense of identity and community over 50 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202130</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R006997/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD9F0C26-AA57-4235-8010-AEBAF429C756</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
