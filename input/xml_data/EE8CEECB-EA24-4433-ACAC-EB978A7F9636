Common symptoms are chronic pelvic pain, fatigue, heavy periods, and pain experienced during sexual intercourse. It may also affect fertility. There is no consensus on what causes endometriosis and there is no definitive cure. Despite the chronic and potentially disabling nature of endometriosis, along with its impact across a wide range of life domains, there is relatively little work on what it means to live with this condition.&lt;br />&lt;br />The overall aim of this study is to explore the impact of endometriosis on couples in particular, and to enhance the well being of people living with endometriosis by providing an evidence base for improving couple support. This is a qualitative study in three phases.&lt;br />&lt;br />Phase One is a contextual phase consisting of interviews with key informants including healthcare providers, patients, and support group representatives.&lt;br />&lt;br />Phase Two includes in-depth interviews with heterosexual women and their male partners.&lt;br />&lt;br />Phase Three involves a Stakeholder Workshop which will collaboratively explore the findings and discuss how insights from this work contribute to improved support for couples and also inform theories of chronic illness more generally.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries include:
1. People living with endometriosis. The study will provide new evidence of the impact of endometriosis on women and their male partners. It will enhance an understanding of what it means to live with this condition, and to live with people who have a chronic condition which can affect fundamental normative processes such as the ability to work and the ability to bear children. The research will be sensitive to the impact of potentially different cultural contexts in the experience of endometriosis. This will enhance the development of appropriate and sensitive couple-centred management, counselling and other forms of support, recognising the cultural and relational aspects of chronic illness. It will add to the ability of those who provide support to people living with endometriosis to understand and respond more effectively to relational aspects of this condition and thus ultimately improve the well-being of women and their partners. Findings will be of direct interest to individuals with endometriosis who are often 'expert patients', highly cognisant of research in the field. It may also provide insights useful for couple support in other chronic conditions. The project will have a dedicated (non-university) website, accessible by the public. Regular newsletters will be posted and the outputs will be available here. People living with endometriosis will be key participants in the stakeholder workshop and advisory group, ensuring their perspectives on the project are represented throughout.

2. The Public Sector: Health Care Professionals (doctors, nurses, counsellors). The study will add to the knowledge of health professionals of the social and psychological aspects of this chronic condition and generate insights to improve the effectiveness of their practice and ultimately improve patients' quality of life. This will be facilitated by the inclusion of a medical consultant with extensive networks in the field (e.g. RCOG) as co-investigator. Additional professional groups (e.g. RCN, Counselling Associations) will be represented on the advisory group and be involved in the stakeholder workshop. 

3. Third Sector/Voluntary Support groups. Several support groups have been consulted in the course of preparing this proposal. They are very supportive of this research and confident that they will be able to use the findings to improve their support to women with endometriosis and their partners. Thus, the research is supported by Endometriosis UK and the SHE Trust, who are major sources of support for people with endometriosis. They (along with patients) have been consulted on the research design and will have an ongoing role in the project advisory group. This group will also include representation from the South Asian communities in Leicester with which team members have excellent links. This will enhance ownership of the findings and their potential utilisation in practice, supporting women and men and advancing our empirical and theoretical understanding of endometriosis. The support groups will also assist with recruitment via their membership and websites [Letters of support are available]. They will play a key role in the stakeholder workshop, where the findings will be discussed and an action plan devised. This will allow the maximum impact on the activities of these groups who currently provide support for substantial numbers of people. Activities will be publicised on their websites. 
Members of the team (LC, NH, ED in particular) have a strong track record of working with community support groups and with health professionals and in undertaking research to inform their work. e.g. the ASFERT study of infertility (Culley) impacted on the work of health professionals in infertility clinics and counsellors (via BICA). The Endocul Study (Denny/Culley) has produced DVD resources on endometriosis targeted at women and an online resource on cultural diversity for health professionals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71255</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6CC3B7C1-8A3B-4E12-9952-767B6D3BB3CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>A qualitative study of the impact of endometriosis on male partners.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human reproduction (Oxford, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/129e89a1e1bbf760dd4cb64327c12f9a"><gtr:id>129e89a1e1bbf760dd4cb64327c12f9a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Culley L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0268-1161</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a350c68422ac2.52157910</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DEB9F582-28DA-4336-B263-AF2D73929C52</gtr:id><gtr:title>'We needed to change the mission statement of the marriage': biographical disruptions, appraisals and revisions among couples living with endometriosis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociology of health &amp; illness</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f2860582c9a02cff3bf91e34c1dc3949"><gtr:id>f2860582c9a02cff3bf91e34c1dc3949</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hudson N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0141-9889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d55cf840da2.06624896</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>507A8083-503D-44A3-95D0-63D05135C353</gtr:id><gtr:title>The social and psychological impact of endometriosis on women's lives: a critical narrative review.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human reproduction update</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/129e89a1e1bbf760dd4cb64327c12f9a"><gtr:id>129e89a1e1bbf760dd4cb64327c12f9a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Culley L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1355-4786</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0460468d9858f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J003662/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
