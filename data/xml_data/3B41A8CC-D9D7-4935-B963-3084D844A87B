It affects a quarter of children aged 5 years, increasing to nearly 40 in every 100 children living in deprived areas. These young children with tooth decay suffer from toothache, sleep loss, problems eating and absence from school and nursery. In England, the most common reason why children have a general anaesthetic is for the removal of multiple decayed teeth. Treating tooth decay accounts for a large proportion of the &amp;pound;3.4 billion spent each year by the NHS on dentistry.

Tooth decay can be prevented. One of the best ways is to encourage &amp;quot;Parental Supervised Tootbrushing&amp;quot;, this involves establishing a good routine with parents brushing their infant's teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste as soon as the first tooth appears. 

Our earlier research found that &amp;quot;Parental Supervised Toothbrushing&amp;quot; can be a difficult routine to start and even harder to keep going. Parents are aware it is important to brush, but struggle for many different reasons. Health visitors can play a key role in supporting parents to adopt good oral health practices, such as Parental Supervised Toothbrushing. In England, health visitors carry out a home visit to all families when infants are aged 12 months and this includes a discussion about good oral health habits. Our interviews with health visitors have shown there is a wide variation in what they cover and discuss with families. Many do not feel confident discussing oral health. Health visitors receive minimal training and guidance on how to encourage good oral health habits. Our study will test if we can improve how health visitors support parents to adopt good toothbrushing routines, namely Parental Supervised Toothbrushing. 

AIMS: (A) With health visitors and parents we will produce resources and training to support the habit of Parental Supervised Toothbrushing. (B) We will then test if the way to support Parental Supervised Toothbrushing delivered by health visitors is acceptable ad practical. (C) We will study different ways of checking whether parents are performing Parental Supervised Toothbrushing. 

DESIGN: In a deprived area, we will recruit 30 parents of infants aged 12 months who are about to receive their home visit from a health visitor. Before this, our research team will visit their home and assess how they care for their infant's teeth. Parents will then receive their 12 month home visit which will include the health visitor delivering support for Parental Supervised Toothbrushing. 

At 2 weeks and 3 months after the health visitor's home visit, our research team will visit the parents again to collect further records of how parents are caring for their infant's teeth. We will ask parents how acceptable they found both the Parental Supervised Toothbrushing support and the collection of information about their infant's toothbrushing. We will also ask health visitors how acceptable and practical the Parental Supervised Toothbrushing support was to deliver. Finally we will compare the different ways of checking whether parents are performing Parental Supervised Toothbrushing.

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: We have worked closely with many different members of the local community at each stage of our research. They suggested incorporating the Parental Supervised Toothbrushing support into the health visitor home visits. They will help with the development of the resources to support Parental Supervised Toothbrushing and with writing a lay report at the end of the study. 

OUTCOME: This early phase study will ensure the support for Parental Supervised Toothbrushing is suitable for health visitors to deliver and acceptable to parents. We will find out which way is the best to check that Parental Supervised Toothbrushing is taking place. We will use the results to design a larger study to test whether the Parental Supervised Toothbrushing intervention can prevent decay (effectiveness) and save the NHS money.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Preventing dental caries is a key public health priority. UK guidance strongly supports Parental Supervised Toothbrushing (PSB) using fluoride toothpaste twice-daily from first tooth eruption (around 6 months). Infrequent brushing is associated with higher caries prevalence in young children especially those living in deprived areas.

We have identified many barriers to PSB and, using MRC guidance, developed a complex intervention to maximize PSB adoption by parents.

The Healthy Child Programme with universal home visits by health visitors mandates a discussion of oral health behaviours with parents of infants. There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of this discussion and significant variation in practice. There are no standard materials or frameworks for this discussion and inconsistent training for health visitors.

Work Package A- AIM:(1)To co-produce training and materials with health visitors and parents to maximise PSB adoption. METHOD: Detailed specification of the PSB intervention will be developed through an iterative process with mixed groups of health visitors and parents.

Work Package B- AIMS:(1)To explore acceptability and feasibility of the PSB intervention to health visitors and parents of infants; (2)To develop an objective measure(s) of PSB adoption. METHOD: 30 parents of infants aged 12 months will be recruited. The research team will collect self-reported and objectives measures of PSB at baseline. Parents will then receive their health visitor home visit including the PSB intervention. The research team will then collect further PSB adoption data at 2 weeks and 3 months. ACCEPTABILITY of the PSB intervention and measurement of PSB adoption will be explored with parents through qualitative interviews. ACCEPTABILITY and FEASIBILTY of delivering the PSB intervention will be examined with health visitors through focus groups. UTILITY of 3 objective PSB measures will be compared with each other and with parental-self reports.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>144644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P017185/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
