These mutations can be small or large. The latter typically involve whole chromosomes or large parts of chromosomes, and can take the form of losses or gains or material, or movement of material between or within chromosomes.

These big changes in the genetic code are not well understood, although many of them are almost certainly important in driving the growth of a cancer. Some cancers seem to have many large-scale changes and these cancers are said to have &amp;quot;chromosomal instability&amp;quot;. No-one knows exactly how or why chromosomal instability occurs, and it is difficult to distinguish the changes driving cancer from background noise.

This research project will attempt to recreate chromosomal instability in a mouse to answer these questions. The first part of this project will be to analyse the mouse genome and use a special genetic &amp;quot;scissors and tape&amp;quot; to cause random large-scale mutations. This will be done by inserting small sequences called loxP sites that can then make random cuts in the mouse genome and join them back together. This will mean that some chromosomes are backwards, some put in the wrong order, some have bits of other chromosomes mixed in with them, some are duplicated and some are missing. This loxP vector will artificially make the mouse genome have the changes seen in human bowel cancer. Changes that promote growth of a tumour will be selected and hence we can detect these as recurrent changes when analysing a large number of tumours.

The use of this genetic &amp;quot;scissors and tape&amp;quot; technique to model chromosomal instability has never been performed before. I will see whether creating chromosomal instability does indeed promote the growth of bowel tumours in mice. Also I will see if the cancer becomes aggressive and spreads to other parts of body. I can look to see if damage to certain areas of chromosomes is important in causing bowel cancer in mice. Understanding the importance of which changes occur will help me to find areas of chromosomal instability that cause bowel cancer in humans. This knowledge will enable scientists to target future drugs at stopping bowel cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Chromosomal instability (CIN), characterised by large-scale structural and numerical mutations, is a feature of many cancers. However, the specific causes of CIN and selective consequences of specific CIN mutations (such as single-copy deletions or duplications) are largely unknown. I propose to develop a mouse model of CIN using transposons to deliver loxP sites pseudo-randomly throughout the genome. Recombination between distant sites has been demonstrated previously, and will result in a variety of deletions, duplications and translocations. These may drive tumorigenesis ab initio, but I shall also cross the CIN mice to Apc-mutant mice to investigate the effects of CIN subsequent to tumour initiation. I may also cross the mice to Cenpe mutants to cause numerical chromosome abnormalities in addition to the structural abnormalities caused by my mouse model. I shall assess the effects of CIN on tumorigenesis in the mouse intestines in terms of numbers and types of tumour, including the promotion of invasion and metastasis. Specific, recurrent chromosomal-scale changes that promote tumour growth will be identified and compared with the equivalent changes in human colorectal tumours. These data will provide evidence for chromosomal regions that affect tumour growth through copy number change, or specific alterations such as the production of fusion genes or gene-gene translocations.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The objectives of this research project are to firstly to develop a new mouse model of chromosomal instability (CIN) and determine if CIN initiates tumour growth, and promotes proliferation, invasion and metastasis. The second objective is to identify recurrent, chromosomal-scale mutations that drive tumorigenesis in mice and compare human and mouse colorectal tumour data. 

There are a number of potential beneficiaries from this research project. 

Scientists and clinicians specialising in the field of colorectal cancer research have the most potential for impact. The area of chromosomal instability is an area of active and important scientific research with a number of existing animal models including the Cenpe and Bub1 mice. However, these models are very limited and the mouse-model of chromosomal instability used in this research project has the potential to supplement and replace these previous models and re-focus colorectal animal research. 

For oncologists, this research answers important questions about chromosomal instability. It has been widely assumed, but never proven that chromosomal instability is a driver to tumour growth and it is clear from clinical trials that patients with chromosomal instability have poorer outcomes. In the short term, this research project will help answer why the outcomes are poorer. In the medium-long term, the information from comparisons of human and mouse colorectal tumour data to identify common chromosomal-scale drivers may be used as a biomarker to tumour prognosis or tumour responsiveness. In the long-term this information will enable a whole new field of colorectal research to develop which may allow further drugs targeting tumorigenesis as well as new chemotherapeutic agents. 

Other fields of cancer research will also indirectly benefit from this research project. Chromosomal instability occurs in most major solid tumours and plays an important role in breast, prostate and lung cancer amongst others. Knowledge gained from this colorectal cancer model may be transferred to other fields of oncology in the short term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>209959</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oxford genomics forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A0A18D4-856D-4287-A314-9A92187FC929</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion about genome engineering tools developed during this fellowship, gave training about how to use them and advice about future plans.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589f1bc36f42f0.92394570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MRC doctoral program</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0D9A441-9FD5-4BFF-89A9-8B76476651D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talked about my experiences of my MRC fellowship, given advice and talked about research outputs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589f1b7e69a257.21215909</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>64092</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>NIHR Biomedical Research Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>BRC Clinical Research Career Development Fellow</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Institute for Health Research</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>BCD21B1C-CFB2-42B4-B2C3-480C90B2D2CC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>589f1ad2ee8d08.39692727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Development of a mouse orthotopic transplantation model</gtr:description><gtr:id>ABD2C72A-3B0A-447B-B88F-963819AACA39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This technique is now in used by two research groups in the UK and awareness is increasing amongst the Oxford region.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589f1c3c681ad9.15251503</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Mouse orthotopic transplantation model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/L001713/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
