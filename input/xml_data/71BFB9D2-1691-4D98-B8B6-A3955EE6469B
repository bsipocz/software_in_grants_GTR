Our first generation of products are anthocyanins ? natural colorants found in plants. We have demonstrated that anthocyanins can be used as highly-desirable semi-permanent natural dyes for coloration of hair. For effective commercialisation, we have successfully sourced the optimum feedstock for our extraction and concentration process, which is currently a major waste-stream from the UK juice pressing industry (blackcurrants for Ribena). We have ensured that a full, reliable supply chain is available for future scale-up. Successful pilot-scale production of anthocyanins was conducted in collaboration with our processing partners, Critical Processes Ltd. (SME), with whom we have a long established collaboration. The novelty of this application is based on the precise polyphenols isolated, methods of stabilisation within a highly controlled chemical environment, and production of desired coloration effects when incorporated in hair care formulations. We have patented the application of anthocyanins as hair dyes; further IP is held as knowhow within the company, and it is envisaged that additional patent applications will be filed. The competitive advantage we have is in providing an effective solution to an unmet need in the hair coloration sector, where there is a global demand for wholly natural colorants ? this need is met by our products. The products successfully dye hair, with colours of red, purple, or blue depending upon application conditions, and display appropriate levels of fastness to washing and light. Successful blue coloration is extremely desirable, as it is notoriously difficult to achieve from natural dyes, offering added value. We are able to complete the colour palette through novel mixtures with other coloured natural extracts (Figure 1, Annex A). Diversified applications of this technology in hair and skin protection products or as beneficial nutraceutical ingredients are new opportunities; existing partners have expressed interest in such diversification in order to strengthen branding opportunities. The Project herein would run for 12 months to develop the concept into a viable commercial proposition; resources are required to:
? Initiate new and develop existing collaborations with partners
? Ensure our IP has substantial and quantifiable value
? Establish license agreements
? Attract and develop follow-on investment streams
? Quantify product volumes required and cost to volume ratios
In order to support these efforts, the Product Development Team will work directly with
partners to:
? Ensure product efficacy
? Meet regulatory requirements
? Develop the product cost model
? Optimise processing and product consistency
? Complete an accurate scale-up feasibility study of production technology
?
