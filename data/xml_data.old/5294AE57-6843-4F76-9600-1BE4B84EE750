transformations in superdiverse wards in four UK cities</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L007096/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The aim of this project is to understand how people communicate multilingually across diverse languages and cultures. We define 'translation' as the negotiation of meaning using different modes (spoken/written/visual/gestural) where speakers have different proficiencies in a range of languages and varieties. When speakers do not share a common language they may rely on translation by professionals, friends or family, or by digital means. Such practices occur in 'translation zones', and are at the cutting edge of translation and negotiation. We view 'cultures' not as fixed sets of practices essential to ethnic groups, but rather as processes which change and which may be negotiable. In our previous research in
multilingual communities we found speakers are not confined to using languages separately, but rather they 'translanguage' as they make meaning. We will look closely and over time at language practices in public and private settings in Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, and London. We will investigate how communication occurs (or fails) when people bring different histories and languages into contact. Outcomes will impact on policy on economic growth, migration, health and well-being, sport, cultural heritage, and law, by informing the work of policy-makers and public, private and third sector organisations.

The aims of the research are to:

1. understand translanguaging as communication in public spaces;
2. understand translanguaging as communication in private spaces;
3. understand translanguaging as communication in digital and social spaces;
4. understand local histories of communicative practices;
5. develop transformative, interdisciplinary approaches to researching translanguaging as communication;
6. develop the capacity of researchers to conduct high quality research in the arts and humanities;
7. inform local, national, and international policy in relation to superdiverse community settings.

This study takes an interdisciplinary approach to understand communication in and beyond community settings, focusing on interactions between people engaged in legal advice centres, migrant business, sport, and libraries and museums. These community sites are selected because they are contexts in which multiple languages and varieties are in daily use in superdiverse cities. 'Superdiversity' refers to the interweaving of diversities, in which not only 'ethnicity', but other variables intersect and influence the composition and trajectories of urban centres. Multilingual speakers who have institutional roles and make regular use of digital and online technologies will be selected as key participants (librarians, solicitors, migrant business people, sports coaches). They will provide access to other multilingual speakers, and to communication in private
and digital spaces.

Ethnographic fieldwork will be conducted by researchers in four superdiverse wards in Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, and London. Key participants will be 'shadowed' in their workplace by researchers. In each site initial observation will be followed by audio recordings, interviews, and online and digital data collection. Photographing of the linguistic landscape of each ward will continue for 26 months to map the changing cultural and linguistic environment. A succession of published reports and working papers will follow a series of research events including: thematic workshops, network assemblies, city seminars, public engagement showcase events and conferences.

A full and differentiated training programme for practitioners, research assistants, early career and doctoral researchers is put in place for capacity building, which will be a key feature and legacy of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
TLANG's design puts in place a strategic network of collaborators whose significant expertise and experience will make visible the benefits and constraints of translanguaging in rapidly-changing, superdiverse settings. Beneficiaries of the research will include individuals, local authorities, businesses, third sector groups and international partners. The project design links people in four city wards with academic and non-academic institutions which share a mission to represent multilingual voices and strengthen local communities. Society will gain from new learning about multilingual communication in British life and its contribution to health, business, social justice and social inclusion. 

How will they benefit from this research? 
Outcomes of the research, and associated outputs, are:

(1) Enhancing the knowledge economy through documenting how multilingualism can increase economic growth and social well-being.
(1.1) Achieved through Thematic Workshops, Network Assemblies, Conferences and Showcase Events highlighting the role translanguaging plays in families and communities for health, work, heritage and justice.
(1.2) Achieved through a series of user-friendly reports, media and policy briefings widely disseminated to commercial and public organisations, through third sector partnerships and academic networks: e.g. Migrants' Rights Network provides the secretariat for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration
(1.3) Achieved through active web-based presence, including exhibition space for audio and video recordings, maps, photographs, narratives and artefacts; project blog, facebook and Twitter updates; postings of research findings on partners' websites; use of existing websites on multilingualism for dissemination. 

(2) Building strategic networks of partnerships across private, public and third sector organisations at city, national and international levels. 
(2.1) Achieved through strengthening existing partnerships with city-level institutions across private, public and third sectors in Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and London. 
(2.2) Achieved through tactical new partnerships with 7 high-profile non-academic partner organisations. The research team will work with them on community engagement and knowledge transfer activities through co-producing media and policy briefings, joint presentations on policy platforms and Network Assemblies, and co-organisation of 4 national Showcase events. 
(2.3) Achieved through establishing a Steering Group constituted of non-academic partners, international academics and AHRC colleagues
(2.4) Achieved through accelerating impact by building a community of scholars engaged in progressive understanding of translanguaging through attendance at regular workshops, conferences, seminars, research training, and assemblies. 

(3) Investing in individuals by supporting their linguistic skills, lifelong learning and workforce development
(3.1) Achieved through training, development and dissemination opportunities and events. 
* 80 private, public, and third-sector participants complete OCN Network Level 3 award for research training
* 4 RAs and 2 DRs undertake research development training 
* 40 participants attend one-week residential training programme, 'Doing Transformative Research in Translation Zones' 
* 100+ participants register at final conference

(4) Expanding social inclusion, social tolerance, empathy and respect for linguistic diversity. 
(4.1) Achieved by developing inclusive language policies and improved access to libraries, museums and city services. 

(5) Creating a sustainable legacy of confident and articulate practitioners, new researchers and informed professionals able to influence policy on language in society.

Together we work to drive international research collaboration and address issues of global significance.

WUN is the most active global higher education and research network with 90 active research initiatives, engaging over 2,000 researchers and students collaborating on a diverse range of projects. These initiatives are committed to addressing some of the world's most urgent challenges and are supported by prolific partners such as the United Nations Foundation, World Bank, OECD and World Health Organization.

We focus our research on four globally significant themes that drive our programmes and ignite our teamwork:

Responding to Climate Change
Public Health (Non-Communicable Disease)
Global Higher Education and Research
Understanding Cultures.
Within each of these areas is a collection of high-quality collaborative research programmes involving a number of WUN member universities along with other academic institutions, government, international agencies, foundations and industry.

In order to achieve collective objectives, WUN draws upon the combined resources and intellectual power of its membership. By creating new opportunities for international collaboration, WUN enables members to extend the reach and scope of their research and establish lasting partnerships that enrich their work.

WUN also fosters the next generation of researchers through its Research Mobility Programme (RMP). This program provides opportunities for early-career researchers, including postgraduate and postdoctoral students, to expand their knowledge, gain international experience and broaden their professional networks. The RMP provides access to expertise and resources that are not available within the awardee's own institution, while exposing them to ideas and cultures different from their own. WUN researchers can also apply for catalytic funding from the WUN Research Development Fund to spark collaborative activities.

WUN is proud of its ability to effect positive results in areas that impact both our immediate and long term futures. Through international collaboration, we will continue to create new knowledge, nurture emerging research talent and ultimately transform the world for the better.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>James Simpson, Jessica Bradley and Mike Baynham have contributed to the network's seminar series:

Bilingual researchers as intermediaries of translation in a research team

(Translation and translanguaging: Investigating linguistic and cultural transformations in superdiverse wards in four UK cities)

Trying to capture the experience of fieldwork within Birmingham's bustling indoor market, Adrian Blackledge writes in a research vignette, 'This is Mandarin. I cannot understand. Rachel transcribes. I can understand. Teamwork works'. The comment captures the importance of bilingual researchers like Rachel for research teams working in multilingual contexts, and yet (in deliberately foregrounding the immediate relief of being able to understand) downplays the complexities of the translator's role. What does it mean to 'transcribe' and to translate? What does it mean to 'understand'? How is understanding negotiated, performed and contested through the process of translation within a large team project?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ceeb62b96481.65570524</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://multilingualuniversity.wordpress.com/seminar-4/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panelist at Transnationalizing Modern Languages: Reshaping the Discipline for the 21st Century (Professor Li Wei, Project CI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A74EA80E-99C9-4163-A831-5230570D36DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk engaged in theoretical conversations about superdiversity/translanguaging and presented innovative ideas for new methodologies to research in changing city landscapes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cee264e426d1.42306012</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.transnationalmodernlanguages.ac.uk/2015/12/15/transnationalizing-modern-languages-reshaping-the-discipline-for-the-21st-century/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited research seminar, Jessica Bradley (Project Doctoral Researcher), University of Jyv?skyl?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E9503AD-8464-4C83-9AA3-4B45971305B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited research seminar:

Witness interviews are tiny but influential segments of long trajectories from crimes to legal outcomes which echo throughout criminal law. Witness interviews archetypally consist of a trajectory from the witness of the crime, through a police officer and onto a written page. This paper examines how this ostensibly inevitable trajectory operates in practice. It identifies a distinctive way of traversing the trajectory through which the inner workings of the trajectory itself are put on display by the interviewing officer and through this display come to recursively influence the trajectory's onward travel. This display of the trajectory draws on four discursive means which I label, collectively, &amp;quot;frontstage entextualisation&amp;quot;. I show that by recruiting frontstage entextualisation, the writing process comes to be used as a resource for both producing text and involving the witness in text production. The paper identifies three forms of activity which are accomplished through this recruitment: First, writing together through drafting aloud; secondly, tackling authorial challenges through written-ness and finally, facilitating participation though the artefactuality of writing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d58b2164b4c5.77747263</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar: The superdiversification of Global English, Professor Christian Mair from Universit?t Freiburg</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A3367EED-0BA6-4F95-91BF-D09A1F25C978</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From Nigeria and the Bahamas but ... currently living in Belgium: The superdiversification of Global English

The e-seminar set out to engage an international collection of different participants including students, professional practitioners (teachers, educators, lecturers) and researchers in themes emerging from the project including 'commonplace diversity', 'conviviality' and cosmopolitanism. 
The e-seminar recruited 83 new members or 11% of the total membership The group Linguistic Ethnography Forum reported it as a 'major recruiting tool, with wide interest'.
The starting point for discussion was the first chapter of a book 'Metrolingualism: Language in the City' by Alastair Pennycook and Emi Otsuji, published by Routledge in 2015. The text, made available courtesy of the publisher, was distributed to all list members on the 13th April. In their chapter, Pennycook and Otsuji introduce the term metrolingualism to describe everyday language practices in relation to urban space. As a result of long ethnographic work in Sydney and Tokyo, they demonstrate the everydayness of multilingual practices in a city. In doing so, Pennycook and Otsuji, focused on workers in a produce market, which corresponds to one of the Tlang project sites - the Birmingham Bullring Indoor Market.

Following the two texts - the book chapter and the response - the e-seminar opened for general discussion on the 20th April. In total, 19 members made their contributions. Participants in discussion were asked not to exceed 1000 words. The contributors came from all over the world, including Australia, North America, Africa, Asia and Europe. The themes addressed by the participants included the issues of transcription, the changing nature of spaces where linguistic practices take place, as well as the question of diversity. Following Creese and Blackledge, a number of people also expressed the view that the focus on the city might be limiting. Others also pointed out the importance of gesture. Another point of discussion was viewing languages as social constructs, which has implications for our understanding of multilingualism. Alastair Pennycook and Emi Otsuji also joined in the discussion at some point, reacting to some of the remarks a number of participants had, especially with regards to making the city the foci of analysis. 
After a lively discussion the e-seminar closed on the 1st May. It was a great opportunity for people from around the globe to exchange views on some of the most current research in the area and make some valid contributions. Given the wide audience of the Linguistic Ethnography Forum, the e-seminar managed to create an interest in some of the concepts explored by the Translation and Tralnslanguaging project and gave it a great visibility internationally. The contributions can also be still accessed on the mailing list archive as a great resource.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b0960b9bdae2.49860579</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lingethnog.org/2015/04/10/2015-e-seminar-metrolingualism-translation-translanguaging-led-by-creese-and-blackledge/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited speaker at Sociolinguistics Symposium 21, June 2016 (James Simpson, CI &amp; Jessica Bradley, Research Fellow)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BE0F5D4-E4DA-4A5D-B7FA-BCB95D2291DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited speakers at Sociolinguistics Symposium 2016, Universidad de Murcia, Spain, June 2016.

Of these, an estimated 1,000 are 999 calls. 1,200 of these calls will result in the creation of a police incident. 
Call handlers use their expertise to elicit from the caller what has occurred, where it has occurred, what offences have or may have been committed and the level of threat harm or risk present. This information is represented within the new discourse domain of the police incident and is passed to a dispatch operator for the allocation of police officers via the radio.
Incidents are a construct created by the call handler of the events represented to them by the caller, and are rarely a verbatim account of the call received.
Dispatch operators allocate officers via the radio with their understanding of events, they will typically create yet another version of the event to represent to officers a picture of what has or is occurring. The police officers' knowledge of events unfolding is based upon this final representation. 
This series of constructions and representations form recontextualizations (Rock, Heffer and Conley 2013) of events as information travels through a series of discourse domains. Using the notion of recontextualization and textual travel (Rock, Heffer and Conley 2013). We present examples of emergency calls, the incidents created and radio speech that accompanies them. Taking up ideas raised by Garner and Johnson (2013), we will show how representations, constructs, recontextualization and textual travel have a significant impact upon the callers reporting the incidents, the call handlers, radio dispatch operators and attending police officers. We demonstrate what is represented as real is often not, that what is constructed can miss the real threat, and that the outcomes can have dire consequences. This provides for a rich view of expertise as situated and in flux.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d588bf77e910.78119084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/call/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/08/Symposium-schedule.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar: Scalar Approaches to Language, Time and Space: Further Directions, Peter De Costa from Michigan State University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB8B8637-D8E3-4629-AC9B-E48CC842E24F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Scalar Approaches to Language, Time and Space: Further Directions

23 April 2015

With speaker Peter De Costa from Michigan State University

Macro-micro models in sociolinguistics have come under criticism recently (e.g., Collins &amp;amp; Slembrouck, 2009) because they offer only a partial understanding of how language resources are mobilized in language practices. Common among these criticisms is the need to move beyond the rather dichotomous reasoning that local language practices are constrained by broader processes and that, conversely, these practices sometimes change global processes. This criticism has generated efforts (e.g., Blommaert &amp;amp; Dong, 2010; Canagarajah, 2013; Collins, 2012; Collins, Wortham &amp;amp; Rhodes, 2012) to better understand the complex temporal and spatial dimensions that underlie language use. In light of the growing interest in scalar-based models, this presentation examined the use of scales to investigate complex, dynamic, on-the-ground realities of language use in a variety of contact zones. The presentation, at the University of Birmingham, aimed to take scalar analysis in new directions, recommending useful social and educational implications, and generating new questions for further investigation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf0d2c1f7116.98565561</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tlang/events/previous-events.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of conference paper at the University of Aston (Jessica Bradley, Project Doctoral Researcher)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F8A8A309-46EA-41F2-89F1-397FA690DE3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper title &amp;quot;Researching performance and performing research &amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cedee37a5ec9.19497542</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch seminar for Golding Series, University of London (Goldsmiths) 2015 (Zhu Hua, Project CI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5DAFDBF8-B4CF-42EB-AC80-5D34EF6240EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Launch Seminar, Golding Series, University of London (Godsmiths): Translanguaging practices among multilingual speakers</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c1b66a9a9ab0.92281992</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gold.ac.uk/calendar/?id=8383</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Studying the workplace using Applied Linguistics'  British Association of Applied Linguistics Annual Conference  (Aston University) Frances Rock (Project CI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EDD9EEBC-C083-4C13-8AA6-034376F575DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Abstract: This paper presents linguistic ethnographic research on various areas of language in policing. The focus is on communication between police officers and the lay people who they come into contact with, particularly when that contact requires explanation with the aim of producing 'understanding'.

Abstract: In this session, I will examine ways of working with data from a range of institutional sites within the domain of policing. This domain is rich with sites for fascinating data collection but also brings its own particular challenges around such issues as data security, ethics and one's position as a researcher. These challenges have potential knock-on effects for analysis and theorising.
I will initially introduce a range of different forms of data to illustrate the diversity of material I have worked with over the past 15 years. This will make it possible to review some of the contingencies which figure in potentially sensitive policing environments.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d588444d1812.93664699</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited presentation, Committee for Foreign Language Assistants in West Yorkshire, univeristy of Leeds (Jessica Bradley &amp; Emilee Moore, team members)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76FB2B40-3E42-4F4C-9F3E-290F82149202</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation title: 'Exploring the multilingual landscapes of schools and their communities: Lang-scape investigators'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cedfe0ae31c5.01226343</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog post: One bright morning in the middle of the night: A postcard from Finland (James Simpson, CI Leeds)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12FDDE1A-14A6-43CC-B097-593EA9F88657</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2016 James Simpson received an invitation to spend three months as an academic visitor at the Centre for Applied Language Studies, University of Jyv&amp;auml;skyl&amp;auml; to develop its research profile and that of TLANG.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a2fe47daca21.53221962</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://tlangblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/one-bright-morning-in-the-middle-of-the-night-a-postcard-from-finland/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>E-Seminar: Superdiversity, translanguaging, and ESOL, led by James Simpson (CI, Leeds)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>821B332D-1274-475B-9074-5EB869152AFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a2ce5fc69622.82193872</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://tlangeseminar2017.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co-organiser of seminar: Language research, performance and creative arts, Language Teacher Education Researcher Network at the University of Manchester (Jessica Bradley, Project Doctoral Researcher)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>641E970B-B31E-4966-BD29-6913F8BCEA42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar on &amp;quot;Why street performance?

Translanguaging in a family-run Polish shop in London

Through a multi-layered examination of the language, business and cultural practices in a small Polish shop run by a multilingual migrant family in Newham, London, Prof Zhu Hua, Prof Li Wei, and Dr Agnieszka Lyons gave life to the definition of translanguaging.

The dynamic process whereby multilingual language users mediate complex social and cognitive activities through strategic employment of multiple semiotic resources to act, to know and to be. (Garcia and Li Wei, 2014)

27 February 2015

In this talk at the University of Birmingham, Deborah Pakkar-Hull explored the development of Mosaic- a piece of multilingual participatory theatre for 5 - 8 year olds that toured to schools in 2011. The piece was created by Theatre in Education Company The Play House, and was designed to promote linguistically diverse practices in Birmingham primary schools. 

Presented from a practitioner perspective and based on data collected during the touring of Mosaic; primarily audio recordings made of the interactions of six participating pupils - the talk focuses on three significant moments from the performance, examining how participatory theatre pedagogies were successfully employed to promote multilingualism and to begin to challenge a culture of monolingual teaching and learning. 

The talk also explored the idea that the participatory approaches adopted in Mosaic,not only mounted a modest challenge to dominant monolingual norms, but also enabled children to explore and perform new social identities in relation to their multilingual resources.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf0cc94212a6.83585117</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tlang/events/previous-events.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited speaker Graduate School of Education, University of Bristol, Dr James Simpson (Project CI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BBCDB2C3-35CC-464B-A89B-BDD328631222</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk engaged with a number of practitioners in the field of applied linguistics and extended conversation around the theme of language learning and migration.

Professor Adrian Blackledge &amp;amp; Professor Angela Creese

Mosaic Centre for Research on Multilingualism, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. 

The UK is in the midst of an era of demographic shift, driven by globalisation and changing patterns of migration. Many UK cities are now characterised by 'superdiversity', in which not only 'ethnicity', but other variables (e.g. legal status, immigration history, educational background, socio-economic status) influence the composition and trajectories of urban centres. Our research investigates how people communicate in these changing conditions.

We investigate the 'spatial repertoires' (Pennycook and Otsuji, 2015) of the Birmingham Bull Ring Indoor Market and the Library of Birmingham (LOB), and describe the discourses particular to these environments. Taking as our main focus a butcher's stall in the Birmingham markets run by a husband and wife team from Fujian and Malaysia respectively, and a public experience assistance in the LOB with origins in Hong Kong, we consider how interaction occurs within 'contact zones' (Pratt 1991), or 'translation zones' (Apter 2006). Our interest is in the everyday communicative practices of contemporary life in two of the city's best-known meeting places. We investigate how social relationships are kept in good repair (Goffman, 1981) as market traders and their customers, and library staff and visitors negotiate, mime, point, tease, compliment, joke, laugh, haggle, inform, misunderstand, complain, argue, and so on. The market and the library are spaces characterized by communal relations where social contact becomes habitual and frequent. In our analysis of such contact we generate theory out of signs in use and action in superdiverse urban environments.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c1b8e3a2c3d6.94362257</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/education/events/2015/gesf---multilingualism-seminar-series-1811.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Structure et Dynamique des Langues (le CNRS, l'INALCO, Paris), Adrian Blackledge (Project CI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FCCC4BD2-C689-4AA4-B441-B0C5E50DBCAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Language and Superdiversity in Two City Meeting-Places

Abstract: In this talk we discuss the ethical issues faced when collecting online data as part of a large team ethnographic project exploring multilingualism as a resource in four cities across the UK. The project involves shadowing key participants at work and asking them to record themselves and their families at home as well as to submit examples of their social media use (WhatsApp, Skype conversations, SMS). Involving our participants in data collection and using social media data alongside other data sets raise a number of ethical issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d58abad9c2e7.89604265</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stockholm University.

 The XXXIII Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Conference Biennial Meeting, (Auckland, New Zealand) [Invited paper]
Abstract: The crustaceans and finfish of the Southern Ocean are a globally significant resource and fishing is one of few direct income-generating activities that take place in the Antarctic. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources requires decision makers to ensure that fisheries do not compromise ecological relationships or cause irreversible damage to the ecosystem. These requirements effectively mandate the protection of other ecosystem services (i.e. the benefits that mankind obtains from Antarctic ecosystems). These services include the tangible climate regulating role of the healthy, functioning ecosystem and its less tangible but still important &amp;quot;intrinsic value&amp;quot;. The fisheries management strategies that are necessary to meet the Convention's requirements must be based on high quality scientific evidence, but they also require information about how people benefit from ecosystem services. The debate over the Antarctic krill fishery illustrates the different ways that people perceive these benefits: Some claim that the fishery is a model of ecosystem-based management which balances the needs of the fishery against those of krill predators while others claim that it exemplifies unsustainable fishing. We explore the perceptions of ecosystem services that underpin these opinions, and the associated aspirations for the future state of the ecosystem. We focus on four sectors with an interest in the krill fishery: the fishing industry, conservation organisations, scientists and the media. Despite the apparent polarity, all sectors share an interest in improving the management of the fishery. Their specific ideas provide information which scientists and fishery managers can use to identify the ecosystem states and management objectives that are relevant to the ecosystem services that people value. Antarctic ecosystems are under pressure from climate change and growing global consumption but the management objectives for these ecosystems remain poorly defined. We suggest that the identification of appropriate objectives is now a priority which requires unprecedented cooperation between decision makers, scientists, and beneficiaries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d58715ce7a51.23113810</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.scar.org/scarmeetings/conferences</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Open discussion at Bloomsbury Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F50E300-3868-409B-85A1-6777174D1DEE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open discussion as part of the Bloomsbury Festival in London (October 2016) reflecting on language-related issues hosted by members of the Tlang team</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>584e88b1b309e6.54960202</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bloomsburyfestival.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited panel: EDUCATION AND MIGRATION: LANGUAGE FOREGROUNDED, Durham Conference (October 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2A8CA65F-CF30-40C9-9618-FF7B93C72423</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Researching Multilingually at Borders Project, Durham Conference (October 2016).

A first look at some fuzzy understandings of law' International Association of Forensic Linguistics 12th Biennial Conference (Guangzhou, China)
Abstract: Scholars of legal language frequently raise concerns about the 'difficulty' of language which is presented to the public. The two audience dilemma identifies two constituent groups who might use legal texts, legal specialists and lay people, and notes that each has different needs and different levels of experience and expertise (e.g. Heffer 2008:52). It seems self-evident that legal specialists will know more about legal terms than lay people. However binary categorisations on the basis of expertise can oversimplify, despite their usefulness (e.g. Sarangi 2001). This paper suggests that we need to continue to look closely at the contribution of lay people to their own understanding of legal settings. In my previous work, I have examined the knowledge that lay people claim in legal settings and the ways in which they bring that knowledge to bear in legal encounters using approaches grounded in linguistic ethnography and social practices approaches to text. However, in this paper I address the background knowledge that lay people claim, about the law, when they are outside law's immediate environs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5898b2571c6.00454577</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited speaker, University of Southampton, (Li Wei, Project CI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF0F16C8-4FCF-44AB-AABD-C5D1F25D11A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited speaker at research seminar University of Southampton, March 2016 &amp;quot; Post multilingualism, translanguaging and linguistic creativity

2 September 2014

This seminar with Dr Heidi Byrnes, Distinguished Professor of German at Georgetown University took place in the School of Education, University of Birmingham.

In her presentation she explored how the teaching and learning of foreign languages, as contrasted with second languages, especially English as a second language in many parts of the world, is being challenged by phenomena that we associate with the age of globalization, multilingualism, and multiculturalism.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf0b73a0b3f0.92702284</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tlang/events/previous-events.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited presentation, Language education academic away day, Leeds (Jessica Bradley, project Doctoral Researcher)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A06A13CE-B422-41BF-8F45-5A907E897E7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited presentation, Language education academic away day, Leeds (Jessica Bradley, project Doctoral Researcher).

The topic was 'Translanguaging, superdiversity and ESOL'.

The e-seminar took as a point of departure materials and two questions for discussion that were posted on a website (password TLANG): https://tlangeseminar2017.wordpress.com 

The materials comprised video, audio transcript and fieldnote data from the TLang project as it took place in Leeds. They were prepared by James Simpson, Jessica Bradley and Emilee Moore. 

The seminar was publicised on BAALmail, the Linguistic Ethnography Forum list, and the LESLLA email list.

The timetable for the seminar was as follows:
23 January: materials for seminar distributed to ESOL-Research members.
30 January: Discussant response to materials distributed to ESOL-Research members, co-written by ESOL practitioners and researchers Dermot Bryers (English for Action, London), Melanie Cooke (King's College London) and Becky Winstanley (Tower Hamlets College, London).
31 January: seminar open to ESOL-Research members for contributions to discussion by email. 
10 February: seminar closes.

There were 37 messages in total during the course of the seminar. A summary of themes follows. 

ESOL-Research welcomed 99 new subscribers between the first announcement of the seminar and its close.

On 16th October 2015 the Centre for Language Education Research (CLER) in the School of Education at the University of Leeds hosted a day-long seminar which focused on current research which crosses over from language to arts and vice versa. The event was co-organised with Lou Harvey, lecturer in TESOL, in conjunction with two of the AHRC's Translating Cultures projects: Researching Multilingually at the Borders of Language, the Body, Law and the State (RM) and Translation and Translanguaging: Investigating Linguistic and Culture Transformations in Superdiverse Wards in Four UK Cities (TLANG).

This report provides a brief analytical summary of evidence which constitutes the outcome of the first of four phases of AHRC funded research project, 'Translation and Translanguaging: Investigating Linguistic and Cultural Transformations in Superdiverse Wards in Four UK Cities' (2014-2018; AH/L007096/1; 'TLANG'). TLANG takes an interdisciplinary orientation to researching language and superdiversity, and its evidence base is built from qualitative data (observations, audio and video recordings, textual artefacts, interviews, and photographs) and interpreted through a linguistic ethnography framework. The first phase of the project focused on small businesses. Subsequent phases are situated in contexts of heritage, sport, and law. The findings documented here are drawn from empirical investigations in four cities in phase one of the project. To reach our conclusions we brought together a cross-disciplinary team which shared an interest in the daily encounters of people engaged in entrepreneurial activity in city neighbourhoods. The project conducted detailed ethnographic investigations in small migrant businesses in Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, and London. Detailed reports can be found on the research project website at: (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tlang/working-papers/index.aspx). 

The most significant achievements from the award so far
The most significant achievements of Phase One of the award included the generation of new knowledge as follows:
1. The role of flexible communicative repertoires is crucial in the process of learning the skills, knowledge, and social practices required to navigate the spaces of the superdiverse city. A willingness to engage with others is a social skill practised in small business settings in superdiverse cities, and this engagement leads to new learning.

2. In small business encounters people acknowledge 'difference' as a positive resource for convivial communication, and this is a means of contributing to unity and social cohesion. Small businesses are often spaces in which regular encounters with difference contribute to the normalisation of diversity. They are contexts where people communicate by whatever means possible to achieve their objectives, and these communicative interactions are an important part of the fabric of local communities.

3. The day-to-day practices of business and entrepreneurship are normally characterised by good humour, conviviality, generosity of spirit, and people's willingness to get on with others. The everyday multiculturalism practised in small business settings contributes to social cohesion, playing a role in neighbourhoods which goes beyond commerce.

4. In small businesses people may engage in cross-cultural encounters, and negotiate meaning through improvised language resources, and these encounters limit 'differences' between people. 

5. In the superdiverse city small businesses are sites where histories, heritages and localities overlap, and this overlapping can open up spaces for communication. 

6. Small migrant businesses are often spaces where migration is positively valued by everyday entrepreneurs, and this attitude can help to counter negative discourses about migration and migrants. Small businesses can also play a role in maintaining transnational connections for migrants, and can contribute to migrants' support of other migrants with advice about navigating social structures and processes.

7. Small migrant businesses succeed when they establish a customer base through niche markets, and this success contributes to local economic growth. 

8. Small migrant businesses sometimes operate as community hubs, providing practical support to people in need, including food, clothing, and even money.

9. Everyday entrepreneurs face challenges in setting up small businesses when they are confronted by bureaucratic demands beyond their skills and experience. New businesses would benefit from better focused support from local government in writing business plans and meeting bureaucratic requirements. 


Meeting the award objectives 
The award objectives are as set out below. In what follows we briefly detail progress towards meeting these objectives in the first of the four phases of the research. We will not account for objectives 6 or 7, as it is too early in the research project to have made significant progress in policy impact or researcher training and development. 
In superdiverse localities in four UK cities we set out to:
1. understand translanguaging as communication in public spaces
2. understand translanguaging as communication in private spaces
3. understand translanguaging as communication in digital and social media spaces 
4. understand local histories of communicative practices 
5. develop transformative, interdisciplinary approaches to researching translanguaging as communication 
6. develop the capacity of researchers to conduct high-quality research in the arts and humanities
7. inform local, national, and international policy in relation to superdiverse community settings
Here we summarise progress towards each of Objectives 1-5.

1. To understand translanguaging as communication in public spaces
Translanguaging refers to language practices that make visible the complexity of language exchanges among people with different histories. Translanguaging often goes beyond 'languages', and signals a trans-semiotic system with many meaning-making signs. In the evidence we collected we saw that translanguaging was often creative and transformative. It was creative in that people took available semiotic resources and made them more than the sum of their parts. It was transformative in that it created spaces for communication through the acknowledgement of, and openness to, social difference. We found that translanguaging was a record of mobility and experience; it was responsive to the market-place in which, and the people with whom, it occurred. Small businesses were spaces where communicative resources could be tried out, driven by a commercial imperative. Businesses exchanges were made successfully, even where interactants did not always share languages, proficiencies, or histories. Translanguaging was a means by which this was managed.

2. To understand translanguaging as communication in private spaces
We found that translanguaging was less common in the private realm than the public realm, at least partly because there was not the same commercial imperative, and often no pragmatic reason, to communicate across languages. However, talk about languages, and communication in different languages, did play a significant role in families. For example, in Leeds the key participant typically spoke Czech with her children, but in situations of urgency, or when speaking on complex topics, she spoke English. The children tended to use Czech when they were with their mother, but they spoke with each other in English. We found that multilingual language use was not only the topic of much of the talk: family dynamics operated through multilingual talk and translanguaging. We saw similar patterns in a Polish family's domestic life in London, and in a Chinese family in Birmingham. Translation and translanguaging were not restricted to the public and parochial realms, but were also a normative practice in private settings. 

3. To understand translanguaging as communication in digital and social media spaces
The key participants in phase one of the research project were not equally enthusiastic contributors to, or consumers of, digital and social media. However, we saw evidence that they were using their mobile phones, and private messaging apps in particular, to establish and maintain networks of support that extended from the immediate city to their home countries; and to do business in new and innovative ways. Overall they demonstrated resourcefulness and creativity in their social media and other online activity. For example, in London we saw collaborative, creative multilingual practices in social media posts, as the family engaged in online puns and onomatopoeia, and this prompted other linguistic creativity outside of the social media domain. The butcher in Birmingham deployed multivoiced text messaging in Chinese as he teased his young employee about the employee's luxurious stay in hospital, and visits from his girlfriend. In Leeds the key participant told her children how happy it made her that they sent her text messages in Czech, in response to her own message, which was in Czech and English. Throughout this sequence messages were replete with emojis, which cut across languages. Across the four cities we saw that translanguaging in online and social media contexts was a normal, commonplace activity for business purposes and that it also contributed to a blurring of boundaries between work and home, public and private. 

4. To understand local histories of communicative practices 
'Linguistic landscapes' capture the presence of publicly visible written language: billboards, road signs, shop signs, graffiti, and other inscriptions in public space. We observed change through detailed mapping of public space in the four wards. We continue to photograph streetscapes in each of the cities to chart changing multilingual signage. We also commissioned major historical reports on linguistic change over time in each city ward. Taken together, this activity offers analysis of superdiverse space as it is inhabited and invested in by people, and as this investment changes over time. We further understand changing demographics in the four wards through narrative interviews with long-established residents and workers. For example, several of the market traders in Birmingham said they had worked on the market for more than forty years, and they were able to describe patterns of migration, and other historical contingencies, which had affected the locality over that period. 

5. To develop transformative, interdisciplinary approaches to researching translanguaging as communication 
The approach to researching translanguaging as communication in this project is transformative because it is interdisciplinary. There are several ways in which the project is both transformative and interdisciplinary. The four case studies are based in different departments, in four universities. Each of these academic homes orients us to a set of local institutional requirements, audiences, practices and demands. A second way in which we structure interdisciplinarity is by bringing together two senior researchers from different disciplinary fields to jointly lead each theme. In Phase One the two researchers were Kiran Trehan, Professor of Leadership and Enterprise Development (Birmingham), and Mike Baynham, Professor of TESOL (Leeds). Their leadership of the theme extends through discussion at team meetings, running data workshops, providing editorial feedback to case study report authors, and planning publications stemming from Phase One. A third way in which the project works in a transformative, interdisciplinary way is through engagement with non-university partners. In Phase One the research has gained hugely from the insights of Jayne Magee, who is Director of Operations (West Midlands) and Head of Community Impact (North West) for Business in the Community (BiC) (http://www.bitc.org.uk/). Across the wider research team our methodological orientation was characterised by both similarities and differences. Our way of dealing with this was to work through data jointly in team meetings and workshops. Another interdisciplinary dynamic was the co-existence of different research traditions, theories and frameworks. We engaged with this creatively to weave ideas together. Our disciplinary discourses and research customs, developed over career lifespans, were at time suspended as we engaged with and valued the work of others in areas very different from our own. 

Translation and Translanguaging in Heritage Settings (Phase two)

Translanguaging: Heritage for the future

This report provides a brief analytical summary of evidence which constitutes the outcome of the second of four phases of AHRC funded research project, 'Translation and Translanguaging: Investigating Linguistic and Cultural Transformations in Superdiverse Wards in Four UK Cities' (2014-2018; AH/L007096/1; 'TLANG'). TLANG takes an interdisciplinary orientation to researching language and superdiversity, and its evidence base is built from qualitative data (observations, audio and video recordings, textual artefacts, interviews, and photographs) and interpreted through a linguistic e thnography framework. 

The multi-site ethnographic project is directed by Angela Creese. The aim of the project is to investigate how people communicate when they bring different histories, biographies, and trajectories into interaction. The research was conducted across four cities in the UK: Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, and London. Sixteen sites in the four cities were identified as places where people meet and come into contact, and where in the course of this contact they are likely to engage in communicative practices. The research sites included small shops, market stalls, libraries, community centres, advice bureaux, and sports clubs. Key participants were selected from interested parties in each institution. In selecting key participants for ethnographic research the teams started with particular languages or groups of languages. In each city ward research teams took as one of their points of departure the National Census of 2011 to identify which languages other than English were reported to be most commonly spoken in that ward. In the Birmingham ward, Ladywood, varieties of Chinese were reported to be the most commonly spoken languages other than English; in Cardiff the language was Arabic; in Leeds the languages identified were Czech, Slovak, Roma, and Portuguese; and in London the language other than English most widely reported was Polish. 

In this paper we report on the second phase of the study, in which we focused on sites differently associated with heritage. The second phase of the project focused on communicative city spaces in which heritage practices were observable. To reach our conclusions we brought together a cross-disciplinary team which shared an interest in the daily encounters of people engaged in libraries, arts, and advocacy activity. The project conducted detailed ethnographic investigations in these settings in Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, and London. Detailed reports can be found on the research project website at: (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tlang/working-papers/index.aspx). In each of four city sites a key participant (two library staff, an advocacy worker, and an artist) collaborated with the research team over the course of four months. The research teams conducted observations, wrote field notes, made audio-recordings in the work-place and the home, collected online and digital communications, interviewed the key participants and other stakeholders, gathered institutional documentation, took photographs, and video-recorded each key participant at work. Key participants were remunerated financially for their participation in the research. The key participants were also invited to participate in a university-led research training course which offered an Open College Network qualification. In what follows we summarise analysis of heritage in practice in relation to key participants in each city.


The most significant achievements of Phase Two of the award 

The most significant achievements of Phase Two of the award included the generation of new knowledge as follows:

1. For the research participants heritage is not immovable and fixed in the past, but is constructed in everyday communicative practice in the present. Moreover, heritage is oriented to the future as much as to the past, as participants play out in practice what they value, and what they want to safeguard for their contemporaries and future generations. A participant in Leeds, a young Slovak woman, has a liminal position as a Roma person. She had Roma parents yet she grew up in a children's home where Slovak, rather than a Romani language, was dominant. She sometimes refers to the Roma in Leeds using the first person pronouns and possessives of the insider ('us', 'our people'), and sometimes not ('those people').

2. Translanguaging in practice is an important resource in heritage work in superdiverse cities. When people with different biographies and backgrounds come into contact in heritage settings they make use of whatever semiotic repertoires are available to communicate. An artist in London deploys repertoires which index an ironic orientation to cultural typification (e.g. a red dress with white polka dots and a scarf); in a Birmingham library an information assistant makes use of resources normally associated with a wide range of languages for convivial interaction. 

3. In everyday interactions between people in the city, heritage is negotiable. A young Slovak Roma woman and her brother in Leeds work out what counts as 'Slovak' and 'Roma' heritage as they plan their future; a Polish artist in London employs a subversive yet playful, strategic yet practical, approach to managing 'Polish' identity positions, negotiating misalignment between identities she orients to, and identities assigned to her by others. 

4. Heritage is not unitary, but is multiple, and multivoiced. In Cardiff, practices in which a university librarian invoked heritage included contact with family members in the UK, Iraq, and elsewhere; faith practices related to Islamic beliefs; contact with other people of Kurdish heritage in Cardiff; and recalled and current practice as a librarian in the university library service. Heritage was not limited to connections with territory of origin. It was the heritage of the city of Cardiff, of the university, of changing technology, and changing practices.

5. Heritage in practice is a resource for convivial interaction. A Customer Experience Assistant in the Library of Birmingham engaged convivially with library users in brief interactions where a multitude of histories, trajectories, and expressions converged and overlapped. Such repeated, patterned conviviality constituted a means to safeguard a positive orientation to superdiversity in the present and the future.

6. Heritage may be deployed as a commodity for business. In Leeds a young Slovak Roma woman and her brother aspire to set up cultural spaces for the Roma people in their area. The activities they hope to initiate will safeguard and transmit to others elements of intangible heritage - including music, food, and dance. She aims to transform her available cultural capital into something that will preserve and consolidate heritage, but also earn her a living. She does this by trying to set up a social enterprise, entailing the completion of a business plan.

7. Heritage can be a site of, and catalyst for, the creative arts. A London-based artist is ambivalent about any straightforward notion of 'Polish cultural heritage'. Her performance is highly original, replete with multiple voices, strategic stereotyping, acts of playful subversiveness, meta-commentaries and reflection. Heritage is a resource for creative challenge, which thrives on ambiguity and spontaneity.

8. Heritage is transportable and mobile. For a Birmingham participant originally from Hong Kong, heritage is instantiated in objects and artefacts, gifts and memories, and physical ways of moving and being. Each of the objects is accompanied by a discourse which constructs both personal and cultural heritage.

9. Heritage is narrated. For a participant in Cardiff a dimension of heritage is her narrative of migration. Her personal history in Kurdistan and Iraq, her journey to the UK via Algiers, her trajectory of belonging, are very much with her in the present. Narratives of home, of travel, and of resettlement are a feature of all the heritage stories told by participants in the four cities.

10. Heritage has a social dimension. Cultural artefacts, practices, foods, music and so on typically associated with specific heritages are a resource for social interaction; they are also transformed as they are transmitted, changed in practice as they are recontextualised in new settings. 



Meeting the award objectives 

The award objectives are as set out below. In what follows we briefly detail progress towards meeting these objectives in Phase Two of the research. In superdiverse localities in four UK cities we set out to:

1. understand translanguaging as communication in public spaces

2. understand translanguaging as communication in private spaces

3. understand translanguaging as communication in digital and social media spaces 

4. understand local histories of communicative practices 

5. develop transformative, interdisciplinary approaches to researching translanguaging as communication 

6. develop the capacity of researchers to conduct high-quality research in the arts and humanities

7. inform local, national, and international policy in relation to superdiverse community settings


Here we summarise progress towards each of the objectives.

1. To understand translanguaging as communication in public spaces

Translanguaging refers to language practices that make visible the complexity of language exchanges among people with different histories. Translanguaging often goes beyond 'languages', and signals a trans-semiotic system with many meaning-making signs. In the evidence we collected in Phase Two we observed translanguaging in practice in heritage settings. The identification of what counts as shared heritage for a young Slovak Roma woman is in part an interactional achievement, rather than always a priori fact. In order to make use of her heritage resources as a commodity, she was required to write a business plan for the city council. This entailed not only interlingual translanguaging, as she moved between Slovak and English to complete the required template, but also intralingual and intersemiotic translanguaging, as she negotiated the bureaucratic demands of the genre and artefact. 

2. To understand translanguaging as communication in private spaces

Translation and translanguaging are not restricted to the public and parochial realms, but are also a normative practice in private settings. For example, the Leeds participant uses Slovak to speak with her siblings as well as other people from the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Her Slovak, however, is heavily influenced by the Czech language. The same happens with her siblings. She says, 'we don't speak proper Slovakian, we don't speak proper Czech, we mix'. She sometimes calls this language 'Czechoslovakian'. She says that she only started mixing the two languages after moving to the UK, as a result of being in contact with people from the Czech Republic. Another influence could have been the language spoken by some of the Roma - mixing of Czech and Slovak being one of the characteristics of 'Romani ethnolect'. In London the Polish participant deploys language play in private settings. Verbal provocation is one of the ways in which she breaks taboos and enacts subversiveness, or in her words, does 'something offensive' and does something in order 'to shock'. Her translanguaging practices are imbued with creativity, such as language play, double voicing, singing and mobilisation of multiple semiotic resources. 

3. To understand translanguaging as communication in digital and social media spaces

Digital and social media practices in heritage settings are shaped by the participants' different levels of digital literacy awareness, by the purposes for which they use digital technologies, and by the values they hold and other aspects of their biographies. For the Birmingham participant, the digital spaces created by SMS and WhatsApp communications offer opportunities for consolidating family and friendship ties in polite and conventional ways, for displaying her interest in language, and for learning new linguistic practices and social roles; in Leeds, Facebook enables the participant to share significant moments of her life which indirectly express her identity and leave traces of her cultural history; while a London artist's social media practices can themselves be seen as heritage resources which intersect with her cultural history and values. In each case, however, we see how digital technologies afford a space where individual identities can be performed, where personal, social and professional connections can be established and maintained, and where that which is valued by these women can be expressed and shared. 

4. To understand local histories of communicative practices 

'Linguistic landscapes' capture the presence of publicly visible written language: billboards, road signs, shop signs, graffiti, and other inscriptions in public space. We observed change through detailed mapping of public space in the four wards. We continue to photograph streetscapes in each of the cities to chart changing multilingual signage. We also commissioned major historical reports on linguistic change over time in each city ward. Taken together, this activity offers analysis of superdiverse space as it is inhabited and invested in by people, and as this investment changes over time. We further understand changing demographics in the four wards through narrative interviews with long-established residents and workers. For example, several of the library workers in Birmingham said they had worked in the (previous and current) library for more than forty years, and they were able to describe patterns of migration, and other historical contingencies, which had affected the locality over that period. 

5. To develop transformative, interdisciplinary approaches to researching translanguaging as communication 
The approach to researching translanguaging as communication in this project is transformative because it is interdisciplinary. There are several ways in which the project is both transformative and interdisciplinary. The four case studies are based in different departments, in four universities. Each of these academic homes orients to a set of local institutional requirements, audiences, practices and demands. A second way in which we structure interdisciplinarity is by bringing together two senior researchers from different disciplinary fields to jointly lead each theme. In Phase Two the senior researchers were: Mike Robinson, Professor of Cultural Heritage, University of Birmingham, and Director, Ironbridge International Institute for Cultural Heritage (Birmingham); and Adrian Blackledge, Professor of Bilingualism and Director of the MOSAIC Centre for Research on Multilingualism, University of Birmingham. Their leadership of the theme extends through discussion at team meetings, running data workshops, providing editorial feedback to case study report authors, and planning publications stemming from Phase Two. A third way in which the project works in a transformative, interdisciplinary way is through engagement with non-university partners. In Phase Two the research has gained hugely from the insights of Toby Watley, Director of Collections, Birmingham Museums Trust, and Stacy Bains, Community Service Developer, Culture Coventry, and the Herbert Museum, Coventry. They both took an active role in analysis of data, and contributed to workshop discussions. Across the wider research team methodological orientation was characterised by both similarities and differences. Our way of dealing with this was to work through data jointly in team meetings and workshops. Another interdisciplinary dynamic was the co-existence of different research traditions, theories and frameworks. We engaged with this creatively to weave ideas together. Our disciplinary discourses and research customs, developed over career lifespans, were at time suspended as we engaged with and valued the work of others in areas very different from our own. 

5. To develop the capacity of researchers to conduct high-quality research in the arts and humanities

Throughout the project opportunities are provided for the capacity development of members of the research team. In Phase Two these opportunities have focused on the team members who are PhD researchers. Jessica Bradley won an AHRC Connected Communities Grant, 'Welcome in Utopias Festival'. From March to June 2016 the Festival supported activities across the UK bringing together researchers and communities to creatively explore diverse perspectives on community futures and what 'utopia' means for communities in the 21st Century. Piotr Wegorowski earned an internship to the Welsh Assembly. This is a RCUK doctoral students' policy internship scheme, and has provided Piotr with an opportunity to learn about a policy-making environment.

7. To inform local, national, and international policy in relation to superdiverse community settings.
The ongoing and emergent findings of the research have been presented to local and national 
policy-makers during Phase Two. Professor Adrian Blackledge presented findings as evidence to the Everyday Entrepreneurs Inquiry of the All Party Parliamentary Small Shops Group at the House of Commons. Dr. James Simpson gave expert evidence to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration (English Language Session). Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery displays the research project film, 'Voices of the Bullring Markets' in its 'Your Birmingham' gallery, where it is on permanent display and available for viewing by the general public. Councillor Brigid Jones, Cabinet Member for Children, Families and Schools, Birmingham City Council, participated as a key panel speaker at the Network Assembly of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Taking forward the findings
1. Business Phase: 

The findings of the research will be of significance in two areas in particular: (i) in the support of small and medium migrant businesses, and (ii) in the development of more sophisticated understandings of the superdiverse city. 
It is clear from the analysis of evidence in Phase One that small and medium migrant businesses contribute to the local economy, but do much more than this. They are often community hubs which offer support to new migrants; they are sites of everyday multiculturalism and commonplace diversity; they are contexts where people can try out and try on new communicative repertoires; they are places where histories, heritages, and localities overlap and come into contact; they are places where people communicate by whatever means possible to achieve their commercial objectives; and they play a role in maintaining transnational connections for migrants.
We presented emergent findings to the Everyday Entrepreneurs Inquiry of the All Party Parliamentary Small Shops Group at the House of Commons in July 2015. Elaborated findings will be reported to an interdisciplinary Network Assembly at Thinktank, Birmingham, in May 2016, which will promote exchange between stakeholders including academics, professionals, and practitioners in business and entrepreneurship, and national and city level policy makers, including politicians and members of Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. Business in the Community is a collaborative partner in the organisation of this event. Presentation of research outcomes will be accessible, evidence-based, and tangible. The social, political and economic consequences of the research findings will be foregrounded through engagement with participants. The day will consist of presentations, film, and panel and audience discussion and debate. 
Reports on each of the three city case studies from Phase One of the project, together with a summary of the reports, are available on the project website.

2. Heritage Phase:
The findings of the research will be of significance in two areas in particular: (i) in the creation and dissemination of new knowledge about what people value and want to keep for the present and future; and (ii) in the development of more sophisticated understandings of the superdiverse city. 

It is clear from the analysis of evidence in Phase Two that what people value as heritage is not limited to old buildings, ancient sites, monuments and masterpieces, but also includes practices, values, and narratives in which heritage is constituted as mobile, transportable, changeable, and under construction. Furthermore, for the participants in this study heritage is a resource for creativity, and has value as a commodity. Heritage is not unitary or simple, but is a complex of mobility and re-settlement. 

We presented emergent findings of this phase of the research to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration. Elaborated findings were reported to an interdisciplinary Network Assembly at Thinktank, Birmingham, in May 2016, which was attended by professionals and practitioners in the heritage sector, and national and city level policy makers, including Birmingham city councillors. Birmingham Museums Trust was a collaborative partner in the organisation of this event. The social, political and economic consequences of the research findings were foregrounded through engagement with participants. 

A film based on the research in Phase Two was produced by a community film-maker. This is displayed on the project website, and has been viewed more than 300 times. Reports on each of the city case studies from Phase Two of the project, together with a summary of the reports, are available on the project website.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>515E4C5E-FF27-4A0F-8AFC-F32FB5555782</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54528da91dba97.53138306</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tlang/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Emilee Moore (TLANG Leeds) member of group of experts on language and literacy, Education Dept, Government of Catalonia.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCF652A9-3FE8-4F80-9A58-279C951A2DBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has meant drafting guidelines for all state primary and secondary school teachers in Catalonia about how best to integrate the full linguistic repertoires of students in teaching reading comprehension skills in English as a foreign language for all students, and in Catalan and Spanish for students who are newcomers to the Catalan education system.

TLang Co-I James Simpson is the founder and Chair of MESH, whose work develops from research he led on ESOL provision in Leeds in 2010-11 (see Simpson et al 2011). MESH coordinates important information about English language learning to help newcomers to navigate their new lives, supporting social cohesion and integration within Leeds. Beneficiaries are adult migrants in Leeds and local community organisations and groups dedicated to supporting them in their efforts to settle and belong. In the absence of any other such initiative, MESH created the Learning English in Leeds (LEL) coordinating website (www.lel.help) for potential learners of ESOL, their advisors, and providers of ESOL classes across Leeds. 

The clearer picture of the rich range of ESOL classes in Leeds that the work of MESH affords is accompanied by significant user engagement. There are over 2000 visits a month to the LEL site. ESOL providers working with refugees (St Vincent's Support Centre; Learning Partnerships) have seen an increase in referrals since the instigation of LEL. Potential students from across our diverse community, including marginalised refugees seeking asylum from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Somalia, have made use of LEL's information network to identify ESOL classes. The resource saves time and money for the services that benefit from it, and advisors who have reported being able to direct potential students towards appropriate ESOL provision as part of their work include: the manager of the Leeds Refugee Forum; tutors and advice staff at Leeds City College, Leeds City Council One Stop Centre staff; the LCC translation and interpreting service team. This demonstrates our clear contribution towards the enhanced social cohesion and integration of newcomers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6c8adb3d480.48667532</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://doinggoodleeds.org.uk/news/2014/05/16/mesh-%E2%80%93-a-new-esol-website-for-leeds-201405151615</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In ethnography we work with research participants.
