The key intellectual aims of the Network are to investigate an &amp;quot;Adaptive&amp;quot; River Basin

typify implementation of relevant Directives, especially in trans-boundary river basin 

management, and then considering how ARBM's focus on negotiation, flexibility and

management.

The international workshops will provide training in theory and methods in the examination of 

IRBM and environmental governance, and opportunities for doctoral students, post-doctoral 

fellows and early career researchers from the UK, EU and China to interact and exchange 

ideas and information about research experiences.

The aim was to explore the possibilities for management of these complex social-technical-ecological systems - whether integrated, adaptive or collaborative - and the continuing challenges thereof, from theoretical, multi-disciplinary and practical perspectives, and in relation to basins of varying scale from the more-or-less local to the trans-boundary. The workshop considered multiple perspectives on basin management - ecological, social, technical and economic - to address the inherent complexities, trade-offs and multiple disciplinary approaches involved in identifying effective solutions to the need to maintain healthy aquatic environments while delivering sustainable water services.
