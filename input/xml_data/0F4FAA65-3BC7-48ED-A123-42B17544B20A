Family Relationship Processes and Child Developmental Outcomes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L014718/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Understanding how parents and caregivers positively and negatively affect children's mental health and development, how specific features of children's mental health problems may affect parents and caregivers and the rearing environments that they then provide for children, are questions of significant importance if effective polices and supports are to be provided that promote positive developmental outcomes for children in the context of contemporary family life. While past research has linked conflicted inter-parental relationships, hostile parenting behavior, and negative parent mental health symptoms (e.g. anti-social behaviour, depression) to elevated symptoms of mental health problems for children (e.g. anxiety, depression, conduct problems, ADHD), questions remain as to whether everyday family environmental experiences (versus underlying genetic factors) really matter in relation to children's emotional and behavioural development. In particular, as nearly all research in this area has been conducted with biologically related parents and children, what are the possible mechanisms through which parent and family factors affect children's psychological development? Studies of only biological families pose a problem in interpreting the relative importance of the environments children experience as a possible influence on their psychological health and well-being because biologically related parents and children share genes, which may explain the presence of such associations. By employing a complement of novel adoption-based research designs (US based adoption-at-birth study; UK IVF study), the proposed project will significantly advance knowledge in this area by examining the interplay between specific family and parent level variables and child mental health symptoms, and vice versa, among genetically related and genetically unrelated mother-child and father-child groupings, across two samples of parents and children in the US and the UK (child age 4-10 years). Uniquely, the study will advance understanding in three primary areas. First, by utilising two samples of parents and children genetically unrelated to each other, we are in a position to examine pathways and processes that underlie children's adaptation to negative family environments and parent mental health problems that are not confounded by shared genetic factors; and importantly, we can identify factors that influence whether an individual child is likely to be resilient (or not) to adverse environments the child might be exposed to. This can directly inform intervention efforts. Second, we are in a position to advance understanding of the relative role of the mother-child and father-child relationships on child mental health. This is a distinctly under-represented realm of research, yet very recent work suggests that the father-child relationship might be particularly susceptible to inter-parental conflict (an association that may have significant practical implications in the contexts of parental separation/remarriage, for example). Third, we will be able to uniquely address a question of fundamental importance in relation to the interplay between parents and children in the context of modern family life; under what conditions is parent behaviour most likely to influence child behaviour, relative to the potential for child characteristics and behaviour to influence parenting behaviour? This question has substantial implications for understanding when and under what conditions particular intervention and support targets may be engaged to promote positive developmental outcomes for children, parents and families. By employing the complement of studies proposed in the present project, we will be able to advance insight into these questions beyond that presently available through any other resource in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project will offer benefits in the short and long-term to academic, child and family policy, practitioner, and advocacy agencies, as well as parents, caregivers and children across multiple family types of increasing proportional representation in the UK and internationally (e.g. adoption, foster-care, assisted reproduction, stepparent households). As outlined in the study objectives, the proposed project will address three primary gaps in past research (1) how family and parent level influences affect children's psychological outcomes among genetically related and genetically unrelated parents and children, (2) the relative role that mothers and fathers play in explaining family relationship influences on children, again across genetically related and genetically unrelated parent-child configurations, and (3) the conditions through which family and parent-level variables influence child symptoms of psychopathology, relative to the role that child symptoms of psychopathology and related characteristics may influence family interaction patterns and parenting behaviour in particular. While each of these questions retains relevance to biologically related parents and children (as has been the predominant focus of past research in this area), the present study offers unique opportunity to address these questions among children and parents who are not genetically related to each other, thereby providing much needed information in promoting understanding of what helps and what hurts children (and parents) in the contexts of adoption, foster care, assisted reproduction, as well as the contexts of parental separation and remarriage. A partnership has been established with the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) which will directly facilitate impacts to practice, intervention/prevention and support delivery programmes targeting families and children in the context of adoption and fostering. Existing links with family court and support services (e.g. Child and Family Court Advisory and Support Service in Wales, CAFCASS Cymru), family mediation services, international adoption, fostering and family research groups (Rudd Centre for Adoption Research and Practice, University of Sussex; Rudd Programme for Adoption, Center for Research on Families, University of Massachusetts, Amherst; Prevention Science Institute, Oregon; UK IVF centres/clinics, and extended user groups facilitated by the academic and non-academic research team), will generate impacts of benefit to children, parents and families in the UK and internationally, as represented by core study objectives and proposed pathways to impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Cardiff data collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>783D6A1F-0554-4C2F-9430-A514BC001E16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Relevant papers have been included in the publication section.

Aimed at policy makers, national and local government, charities, social care practitioners and family and child support specialists, this symposium reviewed the very latest research highlighting family relationship influences on child and adolescent outcomes.
The symposium highlighted very recent practice and policy developments in this area, featuring a broad range of internationally renowned speakers from the fields of child development, adoption and foster care, family and child policy, family law, education and social work.
In particular, the symposium explored the impacts of recent ground-breaking research led by Professor Gordon Harold of the Rudd Centre for Adoption Research and Practice and School of Psychology at the University of Sussex. Professor Harold's research has directly informed recent UK Government policy initiatives and planned national support strategies aimed at supporting families and children. Led by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), this new research underpins proposed future programme commissioning and emphasises the importance of examining and supporting family relationships (including the couple and parent-child relationships) in promoting improved outcomes for children and adolescents. 

As well as reviewing this research and related policy developments, the symposium also highlighted recommendations being offered to promote and facilitate the next generation of training and capacity building that will help equip practitioners with the skills required to identify needs and deliver evidence-based programmes that promote meaningful and sustained positive impacts for the lives and future life chances of families, parents and children.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c00840f24901.36371694</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/adoption/newsandevents</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote Speaker - Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CC8E14DC-CFF9-4265-BE72-770F3F6773D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Growing up in Ireland Conference &amp;amp; AAI Meetings.

These processes were examined in families who were not genetically related.

We found that both maternal and paternal hostility towards children impacted on the child's inattention problems. Child inattention symptoms in turn impacted on their academic ability. Child early symptoms of inattention also impacted on both maternal and paternal hostility. These associations were observed in families who were not genetically related - therefore this association cannot be explained by shared genes. 
We examined whether parent mental health (depression symptoms) and parenting (hostility towards the child) impacted on both conduct problems (antisocial behavior problems) and inattention problems, as well as examine whether child early symptoms of inattention impact on maternal mental health and parenting where parents and children were not genetically related. We found that early levels of inattention in children predicted maternal hostility, but not maternal depression symptoms. Early levels of inattention also predicted later inattention symptoms and conduct problems. Maternal hostility also predicted later child mental health outcomes (inattention and conduct problems). We also examined processes in children who went on to be diagnosed with either ADHD (problems with inattention) or conduct disorder (problems with antisocial behavior). Maternal depression symptoms and maternal hostility impacted differentially on child mental health in those who did or did not go on to receive a diagnosis.
These findings have been presented at a range of conferences and are in the process of being submitted to journal.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings highlight the importance of family factors in the development of child mental health. As the project employs samples that are not genetically related, findings cannot be accounted for by shared genes and provides evidence for environmental processes that may be suitable targets for intervention and prevention strategies. 

These findings also suggest that child behaviors can impact on parents suggesting that providing parents with support and strategies would be useful, particularly where children demonstrate specific early behavior problems (e.g. inattention).

These findings are particularly useful in the context where parents and children are not genetically related (e.g. adoption, foster care, step-parents), highlighting to parents the relevant environmental contributions parents can make to the child.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EF8E510D-0025-4837-A839-55E98747AA72</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6b8c7198991.41001067</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Westminster Education Forum Keynote Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>409DFE44-BEE6-4436-8196-68E8C808D089</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A forum to discuss the next steps for children in care - regionalising adoption, improving outcomes and new standards for children's homes. the future for adoption, fostering and special guardianship - improving the adoption process, reducing delay and providing better support for families.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0268e725148.41619408</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Inter-parental conflict and outcomes for children in the contexts of poverty and economic stress: Implications aimed at improving outcomes for children (see publications section)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4196426-0E1D-420E-ABD9-B0B14897B325</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c020a9f38f27.61749014</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Meeting with Caroline Mokes MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0148986D-88B2-4B29-8845-54C513A54AAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting to discuss the forthcoming green paper which members of the Rudd Centre have been involved with.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c009c369f520.60476433</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation to All Party Parlimentary Group (House of Commons, Westminster, London)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>262BF226-0CF4-4165-8F18-1A84CEEF61C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Purpose of presentation was to provide information regarding the impact of family relationships on children's mental health.

It finds that the quality of the couple relationship serves as a substantive influence both on the quality of parenting that children experience and on their long-term mental health and future life chances. While everyday conflict between couples and parents is common in families, parents who engage in frequent, intense, and poorly resolved conflict put their children's mental health and long-term life chances at risk.
The case is made that by prioritising and investing in couple relationship support and intervention at key stages in children's lives, improved parenting and child outcomes will be promoted. This will lead to more sustainable outcomes for the present generation of children and the next generation of parents and families in the areas of education, health, employment, family stability, and the overall welfare of society, for example reduced anti-social behaviour, mental health, and related impacts.
This review has impacted on policy changes by recognising the importance of inter-parental relationship on child mental health. This has now re-directed policy focus within the Department of Work and Pensions. This has led to subsequent reports on this issue in the context of poverty which will be included in a forthcoming green paper by the present Government.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6ac6940aae0.98553507</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or
