(HN)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P006205/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project examines the crucial role of records management (and increasingly digital records) in the attainment of current development goals. The launch of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September 2015, has made it increasingly essential to recognise and address weakness in the way governments' official evidence base is managed and used. Plans to measure and monitor the SDGs are based on the assumption that it will be possible to access meaningful data as a basis for benchmarking and eradicating poverty. Unfortunately, it is often the case that records are incomplete, inaccurate, inaccessible or lost completely, with the result that data and statistics derived from the records are flawed. 

The rapid transition to the use of digital records has encouraged and been closely linked to 'open government' initiatives, aimed at making records and data publicly available. Again, this has a direct bearing on the achievement of current development agendas in ensuring that government is more transparent and accountable. Yet in the digital environment, records created by computerised information systems do not remain reliable or accessible, even for short periods of time, without a control regime of laws, policies, practices and skills as defined in international standards. If digital repositories are not developed, where digital records and data can be managed securely through time, there is no guarantee that they will remain available or reliable. Unfortunately, it is precisely those countries that stand to gain most from progress towards the SDGs that have the greatest problems putting effective data management systems in place.

The objective of this, which project builds on the expertise within the School of Advanced Study (SAS), its networks and partner organisations, is to bring together academics, records managers and archivists and a range of NGOs to consider how the management of digital records and data can assist in the achievement international development goals, particularly the SDGs, in sub-Saharan Africa. An important element in the achievement of these goals is the combatting of corruption, something that severely hinders justice, good-governance and development in many countries. Managing records efficiently will not in itself halt corruption, but anti-corruption goals cannot be achieved without trustworthy records as evidence. As such this will be an important thematic focus of the project. It aims to disseminate its findings via and dedicated web resource and an edited volume of articles. The project will also consider the feasibility of a globally-applicable set of protocols for digital records management to help ensure that records management policies, principles and practices become a core aspect of development in the digital environment. 

A key feature of the project is a two-stage cross-fertilisation of expertise. In the first stage the workshops will be to encourage a dialogue between experts in the area of records management (from both the developed and the developing world) and academic experts on the politics, economics and history of post-colonial Africa. The second stage will allow them to engage with those actively involved in implementing international development goals. As such, measurable outcomes will be extent of the follow-up initiatives that emerge from these dialogues, and the extent to which the immediate outputs of the research network are fed into the policy-making process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the Case for support for explains, the effective preservation and management of digital records has the potential to make a major impact on the tracking of achievement of a range of these goals, particularly in terms of the fight against corruption. Sub-Saharan Africa, on which the project focuses faces major challenges in terms of the resourcing of its records management systems, and the broader impediments to anti-corruption. As such, we believe that the project has a broad range of potential non-academic beneficiaries, not just in Africa, but across the developing world.

The CI, Dr Anne Thurston, has worked closely in the past with the Open Government Partnership (OGP), and the final report of the project, on 'Digital Records Protocols' will be disseminated through the OGP's many influential partner organizations to ensure maximum impact. 
The report will also be distributed via the partners of the United Nations Development Porgramme (UNDP) Global Anti-Corruption Initiative Network. These include the African Development Bank Group, the Council of Europe and the International Monetary Fund.

The project recognises the need to reach different users through different forms of output. The main project report, which will have clear practical recommendations for the more effective management of digital records, is aimed principally at policy-makers and members of NGOs. Along with the main report, there will be an executive summary, which will be circulated to the international media by the SAS communications office at the time of the report's release at the international symposium. There is also a broad academic community including scholars working on records management and international development, and historians and political scientists working in the area of African studies, who stand to benefit greatly from the findings of the research network. The edited collection of articles is more closely focused on their needs. This is expected to be published in a special edition of a leading peer-reviewed journal. The project website, which will contain all significant materials generated by the project, is aimed at both sets of users. 

The ICwS will also utilize its close partnership with the Commonwealth Secretariat to disseminate the project's findings. We will be closely in touch with the Secretary General's Office to brief its staff on the project from an early stage. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2018 (which is due to be held in the UK) provides an excellent and inexpensive opportunity to acquaint Ministers, officials and members of affiliated organisations from across the Commonwealth with the project's preliminary findings. The Institute also has close links with the FCO and DFiD, which it will utilise to generate interest in the findings of the project. The International Records Management Trust of which Dr Thurston is director, has worked directly with a wide range of governments, international organisations and development bodies, particularly in Africa, and will use those contacts to disseminate the project's findings. Additionally, the project seeks to maximise its impact within sub-Saharan Africa itself by working closely with its partner organisation, the School of Information Science at Moi University in Kenya. Its Professor of Records and Archival Science, Professor Justus Wamukoya, is one of the leading figures in records and archives management in Africa. He has extensive contacts in the worlds of academia, government, records management across East, Central and West Africa. These will be vital to the dissemination of the project findings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48579</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006205/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>69128365-74B2-4A08-8067-57863ECCB013</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>African Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C96AF50D-AD7C-4C61-A30E-B8619DB33BAA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archives</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0A982A4A-12CF-4734-AFCA-A5DC61F667F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Information &amp; Knowledge Mgmt</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CB45E5D-2967-4DA2-A648-379E829E1892</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Records Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
