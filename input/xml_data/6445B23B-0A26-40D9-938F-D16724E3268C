The impact of ?out of town? shopping and the arrival of the ?hypermarket? has caused a migration of shoppers away from traditional retail areas, and the web is driving a huge shift to online retailing. When shoppers venture into town, they frequently use their mobile for price comparisons, product reviews etc. However, whilst shoppers are undoubtedly demanding higher quality and a more personalised service, they are also becoming more concerned about who holds what data on them, and how it is used. With this in mind, Ethos believe the time is right to bring together some of the key emerging trends in technology to genuinely enhance the shopper?s experience, but in a way that gives people control over the data they provide. 

The model is based on collaboration and cooperation, where value is shared between participants. Ethos would provide the technology platform, including mobile applications for customers, access for retailers and hospitality providers, and a technology platform that draws on the customer?s known travel intentions and/or patterns (e.g. parking booking applications and other sources that bring a predictive time and place element).

Customers would join the scheme, by providing information as to their retail/service interests - something that could be updated at any time. These needs and wants would be matched with travel data to understand where and when the shopper is likely to arrive within a retail space, allowing those connected retailers to respond with carefully tailored personalised offers, that can be adjusted to particular times of day, as the customer arrives. This helps the shopper to know exactly which shops have the product they seek, in the right size and colour if appropriate, as well as allowing the retailer the opportunity to target discounts or value-added services. 
Shoppers will be able to determine the number of offers they receive and will also be able to update and remove data as they wish. Customers would be encouraged to stay with the system, not just because of the service provided, but because they will receive part of the profit and a share in the growth of the company. Revenue generation would come from retailers, who would pay for the service based on a combination of ?pay per click? or a small commission on successful sales, meaning they do not have to make an up-front investment. Finally, Ethos, as the provider of the technology platform and owner of the IPR, will also be paid a share of the revenue.

In summary, we plan to place the customer at the centre of the proposition, leveraging all that technology to provide a tailored service, but in a way that allows the customer to remain in control. The customer gets a better service, the retailer gets a one-to-one direct marketing opportunity and all parties share in the benefits. Everyone wins, including the high street that will see increased economic activity that will contribute to its re-generation!</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99080</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971394</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
