In Bangladesh, the modernist dream of creating something radically new has been a leitmotif in the various attempts to liberate, develop and transform this part of Bengal. It can be discerned as easily in the politics of donors as in that of its artists. Modernist art practices have been considered particularly politically efficacious and this project focuses on the ideals of modernist art as articulated and practiced by artists within the politics of remaking East Pakistan/Bangladesh.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exploring the cinema and architecture in particular, I study how ?cultural activists? have been at the forefront of important and radical political movements and contests in the new state of East Pakistan that in 1971 became Bangladesh. Exploring struggles around visual arts and cinematic culture as indicative of political contests facing Bangladeshi society in particular, this project will allow me to investigate the relation between modernist ideals and political aspiration in postcolonial society in general.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Besides the academic beneficiaries outlined above, a number of non-academic users and beneficiaries of this project can be identified:
- National public stakeholders in arts policy at the Bangladesh Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, including the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.
- International stakeholders in foreign arts policy related to Bangladesh such as the directors of the foreign cultural institutions such as the British Council and Alliance Fran&amp;ccedil;aise and the cultural attach&amp;eacute;s of diplomatic missions in Dhaka.
- National and International NGOs and development organisations with an explicit arts and culture agenda, such as Probhortona and UNESCO.
- Arts practitioners such as artists, curators, gallery owners, arts collectors, arts magazine editors and art students within Bangladesh and abroad with an interest in contemporary South Asian arts.
- The general public in the UK and Bangladesh with an interest in the arts, particularly in postcolonial and Muslim-majority societies.

The relevance of the research for these different users and beneficiaries consists of:
- New research data about the links between fine arts and politics that can inform policy in the UK, Bangladesh and abroad and inform the general public.
- New insight into the functioning of cultural politics in a postcolonial and Muslim-majority society that can inform policy and the general public.
- Formal analyses and narrative accounts of objects of art and artistic practice in East Pakistan/Bangladesh that will provide new perspective on contemporary and historical modernist practices that can inform arts practitioners, critics and the general public.

To ensure that these beneficiaries have the opportunity to engage with and be informed about this research project, the following impact strategies will be developed:

- Focus groups
During of the field research I will hold three focus groups at the Film Development Corporation, Goethe Institute and British Council and vite national and international stakeholders and local arts practitioners to discuss initial research findings around the relation between politics and fine arts in Bangladesh.

- Policy report 
The results of the focus groups will be a policy report to be shared with the three institutions, the cultural attach&amp;eacute;s of diplomatic missions in Dhaka, and the relevant NGOs, INGOs and development organisations in Bangladesh. 

- Advanced training course
I will develop and co-teach a masterclass on art and politics for the new Summer School of the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science, which will be open to students as well as those working in policy-oriented research environments such as the third sector and local government in Scotland.

- Media features
I will collaborate with media contacts to produce media features for newspapers, radio and television about my research. I will contribute articles to the well-read open source journal Himal Southasian, the popular Bangladeshi arts magazines Jamini and Depart, and the popular social scientific magazine Economic and Political Weekly.

- Public lectures
I will give two public lectures in Dhaka for local audiences.

- Blog
Throughout the project I will maintain a research blog where I will post research vignettes, analysis, imagery and accounts of arts exhibitions and events. A dedicated YouTube channel will be linked to the blog, on which selected video-clips from the research will be uploaded.

- Exhibition
I will collaborate with Bangladeshi photographer and filmmaker Paul James Gomes to produce an exhibition and catalogue about the research project to be shown in Dhaka and Edinburgh.

- Documentary 
I will develop a short documentary film based on this research which will be submitted to international documentary and ethnographic film festivals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174224</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a brief video documenting the celebration of Eid at a popular cinema hall on the outskirts of Dhaka in 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE13DD8C-8FF1-4064-8316-C04C7DE363FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Viewership through Vimeo and my blog 'De Media Automatiek' was realised and I received response to it.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e11553692c16.23629716</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Video 'Eid at Champakoli'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/74181974</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This video presents the recent changes in filmmaking in Bangladesh due to the arrival of new digital technologies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7B5B5403-8A59-4642-A898-554624EF784C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video was viewed by the general public through my Vimeo account and my blog 'De Media Automatic' and I received responses to it.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e115d0dc1b89.27709870</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Video 'Dhaka's Digital Effects'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/91727147</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RAI International Festival of Ethnographic Film</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1874AA1D-7035-44C2-AB9A-0D5AC2857FEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was lead co-organiser of the the 2013 RAI International Festival of Ethnographic Film which was held jointly at the University of Edinburgh and the National Museum of Scotland.
