Yet, this is not without its challenges. Some of these challenges come in the form of conducting large-scale Randomised Control Trial evaluations (RCTs) of education interventions in real school contexts with real teachers and real pupils. There are challenges for:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>policy makers and foundations in commissioning RCTs and other rigorous evaluations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>researchers in recruiting the participants, conducting the studies and analysing the data&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>purveyors of the interventions in getting participants in the evaluation trained and supported&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>practitioners in implementing the interventions with fidelity&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This seminar series brings together each of these stakeholders to debate the challenges and consider ways to overcome them. Each seminar provides a different perspective with international researchers, postgraduate students, policymakers, funders, programme developers and practitioners coming together to tackle the challenges in conducting quantitative evaluations of educational interventions and having the results of those evaluations influence policy and practice.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The theme of Year 1 is &lt;em>Challenges in Conducting RCTs in Real-World Settings&lt;/em> and&lt;em> &lt;/em>Year 2 is&lt;em> Analysing and Summarising Quantitative Data from Educational Studies&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Institute for Effective Education (IEE), based at the University of York, has established links with UK educators and policy makers interested in evidence-based practice. It is important that this seminar series has an impact on as many stakeholder groups as possible. Our mission is to improve outcomes for all children, and in particular the most disadvantaged. In order to achieve this we not only need more, higher quality, quantitative evidence about what works; but also more policy makers promoting the use of evidence-based programmes; more organisations supporting and training schools in how to use programmes effectively; and more teachers feeling motivated, confident and supported in implementing what works in their classroom.

We therefore aim to ensure that this seminar series has an impact on the following stakeholder groups:
- Policy makers (local and national)
- School leaders and decision-makers
- Programme distributors
- Evaluation commissioners and funders
- Academic and research students

The ultimate beneficiaries will be schools, children, and society.

This seminar series encourages critical thinking and problem solving about the possibilities and difficulties of conducting high quality quantitative randomised evaluations in real-world settings, and analysing and interpreting the results of these, again to make a tangible difference. Policy makers, commissioners, and funders will benefit from this discussion by both developing a greater understanding of what constitutes high quality evidence and how to appropriately commission studies, as well as being able to contribute a view of what the policy world needs from evidence in order to be able to act upon it. 

School leaders and decision makers will gain a greater understanding of the essential role schools play in conducting research about what works and will also be able to share ideas about how to implement programmes with fidelity and help researchers understand the real-world situation schools operate in. Programme distributors will gain a greater understanding of the support that schools need and also what steps they can take to ensuring that their products are appropriately evaluated.

Academics, researchers, and research students will share expertise, skills, and methodological best practice in order to improve the quality of the research base and inspire further projects in this area. This will be of interest also to those working in a range of related disciplines such as health and social policy. In addition motivating and developing research students to have the desire and capacity to conduct high quality evaluations in education is a core part of the IEE's mission.

In the end, improving the debate and sharing expertise on the conduct and analysis of pragmatic evaluations in education will improve the quality of the research base about what works in education, ultimately impacting schools, improving attainment for children, and benefitting society as a whole.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22912</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What counts as evidence-based technology and why does it matter?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>034D72B2-2439-4413-98FC-188201F625AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>influenced educaiton policy and practice in Denmark

This objective was realised.
Specifically, the objectives of the seminar series were to have leaders in the different domains of the education enterprise: researchers, policy makers, funders of educational evaluations, disseminators of educational interventions, education decision makers and practitioners share the challenges that they face in conducting evaluations and systematic reviews of evaluations so that collaboratively we could generate solutions to these issues. Through better understanding of the processes involved and the challenges that each stakeholder faces, came up with suggestions of ways of structuring RCTs and other large-scale evaluation to meet the needs of all participants.
Another objective was to disseminate the discussions and ideas generated widely to all stakeholders in the field with the aim of encouraging more systematic evaluations of educational interventions. With the growing bank of proven interventions, decision makers and practitioners can look to databases and websites of evidence-based interventions in deciding what interventions to implement with their pupils. This has been achieved by the submission of one journal article on the use of RCTs in education, mostly for researchers; the writing of another more generic article to a larger audience of policy makers, funders, and education administrators, and the publication of a special edition of Better:Evidence-based Education for teachers, head-teacher and other stakeholders in the education evaluation enterprise. The Better edition is a compilation of articles written in plain English by many of the presenters of the seminar series. 
The IEE has established links with UK educators and policy makers interested in evidence-based practice. This seminar series helped us expand our contacts to help the stakeholders in education evaluations engage in studies that are likely to improve outcomes for all children, and in particular the most disadvantaged. The seminar presentations highlighted the need for more higher quality, quantitative evidence about what works; to encourage policy makers to promote the use of evidence-based interventions; to have more organisations supporting and training schools in how to implement interventions effectively; and to have providers of interventions support teachers in implementing proven practices their classroom.
Academics, researchers, and research students shared expertise, skills, and methodological best practice to improve the quality of the research base and inspire further projects in this area. They learned to appreciate the challenges of schools in participating in evaluations. In addition, research students participated in the series and learned of the challenges on conducting high quality evaluations in education and ways of overcoming them.
In the end, improving the debate and sharing expertise on the conduct and analysis of pragmatic evaluations will improve the quality of the research base about what works in education, ultimately impacting schools, improving attainment for children, and benefitting society as a whole.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This seminar series actively engaged following stakeholder groups:
