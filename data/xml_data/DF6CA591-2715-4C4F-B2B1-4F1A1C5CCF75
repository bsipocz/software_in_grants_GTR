&lt;ul>

 &lt;li>provide a systematic international review of gender recognition law and policy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>provide accessible knowledge transfer and impact generation to user-groups and stakeholders&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>enable knowledge transfer between academics at an interdisciplinary level, and policy makers, NGOs, practioners, voluntary, community and campaigning organisations. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The objectivities will be met through the following activities:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>publication and dissemination of a Gender Recognition Review&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>participatory action research-based workshops:&lt;/strong> the workshops will identify issues of consideration and further recommendations for future redrafting of the GRA&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>stakeholder seminars&lt;/strong>: the Gender Recognition Review will form the basis for nine dissemination seminars delivered to key stakeholder groups. Seminars will focus on the findings from the PIs previous research, and further issues for consideration and recommendations for policy change emerging from the PAR workshops&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>2 Day Conference&lt;/strong>: the conference will centre the importance of dialogue both across academic disciplines and between academic and non-academic members, and provides an arena where academics and researchers from a broad range of disciplines engage with relevant user groups.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project relates directly to three key areas identified by the ESRC as economic and social research challenges, and as strategic priorities for 2009-2014 (see Pathways to Impact). The proposal arises from a consultation exercise, which the PI conducted with a comprehensive range of organisations working in the field of gender diversity in the UK, including organisations, professionals, and representatives of key stakeholder organisations. The consultation engaged directly with UK policy makers (the Government Equality Office (GEO)), educational and research bodies (Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES)) and transgender support groups (GENDYS and the Beaumont Trust), whom this proposal was developed with (see Letters of Support). Each of these stakeholder/user groups commented on early drafts of the proposal and put forward ideas for the planned activities in relation to their own strategic goals. For example, the idea for the Gender Review came out of the strategic priorities of the GEO and GIRES to develop a programme of public education and awareness; while each of the above groups suggested that workshops and seminars would be productive. The conference was also supported by the consulted organisations and members of each have agreed to attend as speakers. The consultation indicated that the proposed project will have considerable impact, and that there is a need for the policy recommendations of the PI's previous research to be developed and maximised for immediate, medium and long-term impact (see Letters of Support). As well as contributing to the development of the proposal, these key stakeholder groups are written into the proposal in terms of its delivery, dissemination strategy and impact programme throughout the project and beyond. The beneficiaries will include: 
1) Gender diverse people and those close to them. 
2) Voluntary and Community organisations (such as the Scottish Transgender Alliance; Equalities Network; Equalities Unit; Press For Change, GENDYS, the Beaumont Society GIRES, SYBILS, and the Gender Trust, as well as the many and transgender support group organisations operating in the UK). Benefits will include the development of knowledge concerning gender diversity law and policy, care provision, and of the changes taking place with law, policy and care provision at a national and international level (see Case for Support and Letters of Support). 
3) Stakeholder groups (such as the Government Equalities Office and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission) (see Case for Support). 
4) Professionals working with gender diverse people, especially those in Gender Identity Clinics; although the project will be of interest across the different tiers of healthcare provision. The research findings could be drawn on in terms of identifying and publicising good and interesting practice, potentially improving relations with the wider gender diverse communities. 
5) Policy makers concerned with gender diversity and wellbeing. The Review will be disseminated to key agencies such as the Department of Health. 
6) The international networks and communities of practice associated with gender diversity, including WPATH. 
7) Wider society. Findings will be disseminated through the media (for example the Guardian and the BBC) in relation to public education. 

There will be immediate impacts during the project (via the Review, workshops, seminars and the conference); medium term impacts (via further dissemination of the Review and press releases) and longer term impacts (via the policy/practice recommendations and academic publications). The conference will enable links to be formed between user-groups, stakeholders and academics. In turn, this will bring potential for future collaborations between these sectors; enabling the legacy of the activity to be managed to engage beneficiaries, and to provide lasting value to participants, stakeholders, social science communities and wider society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38363</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Non-Academic Research Report</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DBAE05B3-F685-4C46-B2B3-98E32836446F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Non-Academic Research Report Research Report designed and disseminated to non-academic audiences through the project activities, impact and KE strategies.

Using participatory action research methodology proved fruitful for sharing knowledge between and amongst these groups. Participatory action research thus allowed a two-tiered flow of knowledge exchange, through which the PI and the groups and individuals involved in the project formulated a set of recommendations for future changes to the Gender Recognition Act (GRA). These recommendations will feed into forthcoming consultations with the Government 'Cross- Parliamentary Forum on Transsexualism'. The project's scientific impacts are also evident in the strengthening of the PI's networks with cultural practitioners. In this way, the project has cemented the PI's working relationships with a number of individuals and groups within the cultural industries, working for example, as photographers, performers, writers, musicians, artists, filmmakers on themes related to gender and sexual diversity. The knowledge exchange project enabled further links between relevant academic and non-academic groups , which have been solidified through the formation of 'Sexgen'; a network of academics, activists and cultural practitioners. Additional societal impacts can be seen through the PIs involvement with events at Leeds Art Gallery and Selfridges:</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings have led to the publication of a research report, which develops recommendations for changes to gender recognition legislation and sets out best practice guidelines.
