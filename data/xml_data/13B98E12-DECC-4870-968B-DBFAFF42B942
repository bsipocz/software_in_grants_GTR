the third leading cause of mortality in Europe. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are
affected every year. Post-traumatic epilepsy is the most common cause of new-onset
epilepsy in young adults; following penetrating brain wounds, the likelihood of developing
epilepsy is more than 50%. 30 to 40% of patients with post-traumatic epilepsy have seizures
that are incompletely controlled with currently available medication. Moreover, unnecessary
treatment with currently available antiepileptic drugs may then impair neurorehabilitation after
brain trauma. It is evident that this field desperately needs new therapeutically relevant
targets. In order to find them, we need to understand in detail the mechanisms engaged
upon brain trauma. In this proposal, five European groups, with expertise ranging from
cellular to systems Neuroscience, will pursue a common aim: to disclose the mechanisms
and impact of trauma-induced changes in inhibitory neurotransmission in the cortex.

Preliminary results from our collaborators suggest a working hypothesis in which a major
component of altered inhibitory neurotransmission upon brain trauma is the
malfunction of proteins involved in chloride transport in neurons. Subsequent
abnormalities in neuronal chloride regulation not only perturb inhibitory signals, but also
appear to be crucial for post-traumatic neuronal survival and proliferation, leading to altered
activity of neuronal networks. Thus, the multifaceted impact of chloride transport malfunction
in neurons makes it a particularly promising target with strong potential for innovative
therapeutic strategies to improve rehabilitation of brain trauma patients in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Progressive network reorganization and altered proliferation are major events leading to traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related complications, such as post-traumatic pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and cognitive impairment. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, making research in this field mandatory. The proposed project aims at exploring the contribution of altered chloride homeostasis and GABAergic transmission to TBI-triggered reactive plasticity mechanisms, from cellular to system levels. The working hypothesis of our consortium is that TBI induces changes in the chloride regulatory proteins KCC2 and NKCC1, leading to altered intracellular chloride homeostasis and changes in the polarity of GABAA receptor-mediated responses. Those may then be responsible for the resistance of therapies targeting the GABAergic system. According to preliminary data from our partners, TBI-induced chloride transport malfunction leads to hyper-excitability as well as deficits in BDNF trophic support. With our partners, we aim to target the underlying mechanisms with a specific focus on how GABAA receptor-mediated depolarization alters proliferation in affected neurogenic niches through p75NTR pro-apoptotic effects on interneurons. Given the role of different interneuron subtypes in microcircuit activity, a major focus of this project will be to understand how these processes contribute to acquired rhythmopathies and epileptogenesis at the functional level. We and our partners will address these questions using a combination of state-of-the-art transgenic tools for both temporal and cell-specific control and monitoring of intracellular chloride as well as chloride regulatory proteins after TBI. ACRoBAT incorporates several innovative dimensions aimed at designing novel tools, biomarkers and intervention strategies. Ultimately, we will test the therapeutic relevance of novel compounds modulating KCC2 function in TBI experimental models.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Based on our preliminary results, we expect to elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of traumatic brain injury on chloride homeostasis and GABAergic transmission and on the resulting deregulation of hippocampal stem cell proliferation, neuronal apoptosis and epileptic network activity. 

From our preliminary data, we also expect that compounds that enhance function of the potassium-chloride transporter KCC2 will help the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat traumatic brain injury in a clinical setting in the future. 

The main beneficiaries of our research are likely to be scientists working on the development of therapies for traumatic brain injuries, who will be able to use the results of our research to design new treatments. In the long term, clinicians and patients will also benefit from having access to such new treatments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195582</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R001197/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
