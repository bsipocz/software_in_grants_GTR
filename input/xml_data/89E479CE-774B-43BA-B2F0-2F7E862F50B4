Although drug therapy successfully reduces coronary events, the overall reduction in risk is relatively modest and could be greatly improved by the addition of lifestyle modifications. Recent data shows certain plant foods may be as effective as drug therapy in reducing CVD risk. In this randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial we will examine the additional benefit of potent CVD protective foods (soy foods rich in isoflavones and cocoa extract rich in proanthocyanidins) to drug therapy, on CVD risk in postmenopausal women with T2DM. The primary end points will be changes in carotid-intima-media thickness and total plaque volume. We will also assess a range of other established and novel biomarkers of CVD risk. This trial will also allow us to estimate the scale of future trials with clinical end points in this population, potentially tailor risk assessment measures to incorporate risk factors that are important for women and provide preliminary advice on potential preventative measures that T2DM women could adopt to reduce their risk of developing CVD.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have been published in the top diabetes journal and in addition there was significant media interest.

Our intervention tested whether 12-month daily consumption of small chocolate bars supplemented with a mixture of cocoa flavanols and soy protein isolate containing isoflavones could improve markers of CVD risk and insulin sensitivity in comparison to a non-supplemented placebo chocolate bar. The study population were post-menopausal women who had been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes; this sub-group of the population experience a very rapidly increase in their risk of CVD once the protection of the pre-menopausal state has been lost. Further, all the women were on medication to reduce their CVD risk, typically on statins and sometimes also with other drug therapies in place. We showed that the polyphenol-enriched diet significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and increased HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) and reduced overall CVD risk. We also showed that the treatment improved a marker of insulin resistance in the subjects by reducing levels of circulating insulin; insulin resistance is a risk factor for diabetes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The finding that a long-term dietary intervention beneficially affected the CVD and risk of the study population supports the findings from other reported studies showing that flavonoids like cocoa flavanols can reduce CVD risk. The novel finding that dietary bioactives can cause significant improvements in the cholesterol status of subjects who are already on medication for cholesterol reduction (statins) is really important and should be picked up by the medical community and exploited where appropriate (e.g. specific dietary advice to complement the drug therapy). The results we obtained showing reductions in circulating insulin show that diabetes should also be investigated further as a target for dietary polyphenols. This would require the conducting of long-term intervention trials specifically designed to investigate the effects of long-term consumption of polyphenols on markers of diabetes risk in pre-diabetic subjects who are at risk of developing diabetes but who currently are not diabetic.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BE651C91-00C1-4F6C-A990-3AF4C7EFC6C0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649f1fa418a9.93030647</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>87DB4318-D704-46F4-9EFA-C08F32BB622D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chronic ingestion of flavan-3-ols and isoflavones improves insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein status and attenuates estimated 10-year CVD risk in medicated postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes: a 1-year, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Diabetes care</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4423f13dd28da1c10f55c3bf0625c8da"><gtr:id>4423f13dd28da1c10f55c3bf0625c8da</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Curtis PJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0149-5992</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5459f2dd42d3d5.11633546</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F9EC0144-60AE-4618-8208-47F6EDBFC578</gtr:id><gtr:title>Vascular function and atherosclerosis progression after 1 y of flavonoid intake in statin-treated postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The American journal of clinical nutrition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4423f13dd28da1c10f55c3bf0625c8da"><gtr:id>4423f13dd28da1c10f55c3bf0625c8da</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Curtis PJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-9165</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5459f2dd184ae7.03209492</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00043039</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
