The aims of the research were to explore the labour market experiences of undocumented migrants within an increasingly constrained policy and economic environment. We set out to examine decisions to use or not use co-ethnic networks in the search for work within or outside ethnic enclaves from the perspectives of migrants and migrant entrepreneurs. We also aimed to contribute to and develop theoretical debates in the area of social capital based on the specific case of undocumented migrants, in the context of worker/employer relationships, in particular on the basis of ethnicity, power, class and gender. 

The major of achievements of the grant, to date have been:

To successfully carry out the fieldwork interviews with a very hard to reach group (undocumented migrants) and to obtain sensitive data on their social and economic lives as well migration journeys, transnational linkages and aspirations and to successfully interview 24 migrant entrepreneurs and to carry out the internet focus group, to explore their businesses, recruitment, use of social networks and their changing (or unchanging) positions of the employment of undocumented migrant workers within the current sanctions framework. 

1. To contribute to policy debates by exploring the impact of raids and sanctions on undocumented migrants and employers (e.g. a stakeholder policy workshop, a sanctions policy documents and a published paper in Critical Social Policy).

2. To consider how power, gender, immigration status and other intersections affect workplace relations (Policy Press book forthcoming 2015).

3. To critically evaluate and build on theories of social capital, in relation to the experiences of undocumented migrants (Policy Press book forthcoming 2015).

4. To have engaged in extensive non-academic impact including capacity building activities (training and development as well as the production of documents including signposting and a rights guide).

5. To have disseminated widely for the grant to a range of different audiences including academics, policy makers and other stakeholders through presentations, written outputs, the project website, podcasts and films.

6. To have facilitated networking and knowledge exchange among academics and non-academic stakeholders through the sanctions policy meeting, the project advisory groups, mid-project workshop and end of project conference. 

7. To have engaged directly with policy makers through different routes including those mentioned above and directly through an invited presentation at the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration and Migrant Rights Network and a meeting with Richard Chapman from the Economic and Domestic Affairs section of the Cabinet Office who was working as part of a small team in the Cabinet Office examining illegal working practices in the illicit economy. The Trades Union Congress recommended that Richard Chapman contact us as a consequence of this research. 

8. We assisted a producer Seamus Mirodan, for Insight, an award-winning documentary production company, with a project he was working on for Channel 4 based on migrants in London, including those who are undocumented. We arranged his contact with some of the project stakeholders, community organisations and one of our community fieldworkers. We also met with award winning documentary filmmaker, Sean McAllister, who was working on a film proposal on undocumented migrants to discuss our research findings. 

The grant objectives have almost all be met. One area where we did not quite meet the objectives was the shortfall in interviews with undocumented migrants from Bangladesh where we had intended to interview 20 but only managed to access 15 and then had to stop trying to locate this group in order to finish the research. We found that Bangladeshi undocumented migrants were less likely to share information about their status and so were less likely to be known to each other for snowballing and other access routes making them harder to reach. This was in spite of tremendous efforts including a huge amount of networking and cold calling by both the university based team and the community interviewers. 

The grant has produced two data sets and the main findings are: 
Findings undocumented migrants 

Reasons for migration varied; most often it was economically motivated or due to fear of persecution. A number of interviewees used smugglers or agents to organise their journeys, resulting in debts. Others entered on visas. 

Work was found through existing or newly developed social networks. Over time routes into work expanded to include previous employers and individual strategies such as the internet, community newspapers and cold calling. 

Fewer women were currently working than men usually because they had young children. However their lives were isolated; for some dependency on a partner was problematic. 

Clustered in a small range of largely unskilled and less regulated workplaces, there were few opportunities for vertical mobility and limited possibility of horizontal movement between sectors. Work was characterised by low pay, generally below minimum wage. They felt themselves disadvantaged relative to other workers. Little choice was exercised in the workplace, although a minority was able to exert individual agency to make incremental job progression through skills' acquisition and expanding social networks. 

Government policy, especially sanctions, created high levels of fear but had not negated the need for work. The consequences appeared to be a worsening of terms and conditions and a greater vulnerability among some undocumented migrants. 

The lack of a formal immigration status was the lens through which undocumented migrants lived their everyday social and economic lives. It informed all decision-making and inhibited wider non-community social networks, limited spatially mobility and negatively impacted on any potential for integration and rights' claiming. It also created greater levels of dependency on employers and co-ethnic networks, increasing potential for exploitation. 

There was evidence of a hierarchy based on immigration status; however these were more complex and intersected also with class, religion (sects) and caste. 

Findings employers

Some went into business because of discrimination and blocked opportunities. Others came from families with a history of entrepreneurship. 

Decisions about who to employ were informed by skills' shortages consequent on immigration controls, small low profit margin businesses, trust derived from social networks and obligations. 

Employers were aware of sanctions, knew the implications of breaching employment regulations and carefully weighed up whom they employed and in what capacity. Tactics to minimise risks included: short-term employment and employing small numbers of undocumented migrants within a larger pool of documented migrants. Fewer claimed they employed undocumented migrants than in the past, although around a third still did so. There was clear evidence that social networks, kinship, community, political obligations, ethnic and political solidarity, their own experience of being an asylum seeker or undocumented migrant, availability of workers, linguistic, cultural and gender preferences, perceptions of 'good' workers, government policy and economic considerations influenced employment decisions. 

Stereotypical concepts were adopted of what constituted a good worker based on ethnicity and gender. 

Trust was a unifying aspect of the ways in which both employers and undocumented migrants operated in relation to employment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have implications for policy and theory. Policy makers can evaluate the limitations of current approaches of internal sanctions by reading our outputs and consider the alternatives that we have suggested. We will continue to engage with policy makers and intend to do more work in this area over the coming 12 months. Campaigning organisations, unions and rights groups can use our findings to show the difficulties experienced by undocumented migrants and their vulnerability to and experiences of low pay and precarious work. They can assist in campaigns to show the gaps between employment rights and the reality of workers' experiences. They can use our publications, in particular the rights and signposting guides, to provide advice and support. Stakeholder groups and academics, as well as policymakers may utilise our three YouTube films to encourage discussion around undocumented migration. We will continue to work closely with NGO and other organisations to take forward our work that shows the realities for the most excluded and hidden workers. We will contribute to theoretical and other academic debates through our continued dissemination in journals, edited books and our own book from the project to be published by Policy Press in 2015. We have already published in some leading journals and will continue to write from the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1DD3F170-3E90-488C-8949-B2C9E591601B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c45ab96268.26256362</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
