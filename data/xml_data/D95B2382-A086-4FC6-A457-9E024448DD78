Much research concerning environmental H2S has been carried out over the past 25 years, but it is very recent data pointing to roles of endogenous H2S in mammals both normal and pathological functions of the peripheral nervous system. The gastrointestinal tract (bowel) contains the highest concentration of H2S generated either by gut bacteria or by enzyme systems in the bowel wall. It was this observation that prompted us to perform some preliminary experiments to determine what H2S would do to sensory signals generated from the gut. The sensory nerves that project from the gut to the brain respond to a diverse range of chemicals that are released during normal digestion or inflammation. These nerves help coordinate gut function, influence feeding behaviour and generate abdominal sensations such as discomfort and pain. We made the surprising finding that physiological concentrations of H2S excite intestinal sensory nerves and that it may act by activating specific cell membrane proteins that were only discovered in about the past decade. These are the TRP ion channels now thought to be responsible for many forms of thermal, mechanical, chemical, and/or painful sensations. The overall aims of this proposal are to systemically investigate the physiological role of H2S signalling in abdominal sensory communication by using a multi-disciplinary approach to find out where and how H2S acts on these TRP channels to excite the intestinal sensory neurones, what types of sensory neurones are activated, and whether H2S is released to activate sensory neurones during normal gut function and/or when the bowel is inflamed. The proposed work involves the integration of molecular and cellular physiology with systems neuroscience by an internationally recognised group of experts at the University of Sheffield. A number of different experimental approaches will be used that allow us to detect the electrical signals generated by sensory nerves in the mouse intestine in response to the application of H2S. Using drugs that interact with TRP channels and other receptors in the gut we will be able to determine the site of action of H2S and in particular whether H2S acts directly on the intestinal sensory nerve endings or indirectly by causing release of other chemical mediators from cells in the gut wall. Other drugs block the enzymes that are needed by the body to generate H2S. These can therefore be used to determine how locally produced H2S contributes to the sensitivity of gut sensory afferents and particularly its role in inflammation when the sensory endings become hypersensitive leading to pain and discomfort. Research into sensory signalling from the gut is at the cutting edge of enteric neurobiology. The systematic characterisation of the mechanisms underlying sensory signalling will enhance the competitiveness of the UK pharmaceutical industry and may in the long term lead to improvement in new drugs to treat bowel disorders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our preliminary data has shown that physiological concentrations of H2S excite sensory neurons in the gut by causing release of neurotransmitters and has identified a subset of TRP ion channels that may be the direct target of H2S. The main objectives are to determine the site of action of H2S; to investigate the mechanism of its action and to determine the roles of H2S signalling in visceral sensory transmission in normal mice and mice with post-inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity. Extracellular afferent nerve recordings combined with several molecular and cellular biological techniques will be employed to achieve these specific objectives. The detailed procedures include: 1. afferent recording from an isolated segment of intestinal mesenteric nerve bundles in (a) normal, (b) capsaicin pre-treated, (c) chronic sub-diaphragmatic vagotomized mice, and (d) post-inflammatory mice infected with Trichinella spiralis. 2. constructing quantitative afferent discharge rate dose-response curves to H2S under these various conditions 3. examining the dose related effects of non-selective TRP receptor antagonists ruthenium red, lanthanum, 2APB and gadolinium 4. examining the distribution of cystathionine-?-synthetase (CBS) and cystathionine-?-lyase (CSE) expression, the specific enzymes for H2S production, in the gut wall using immunohistochemistry 5. determining the effect of endogenous H2S using PAG and hydroxylamine (specific inhibitors of CBS and CSE) on afferent sensitivity under the different conditions 6. identifying gut-specific sensory neurones by retrograde labelling for patch clamp electrophysiology, calcium imaging, immunocyctochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR to determine role of specific TRP channels in afferent (hyper-)sensitivity. 7. assessing the generation of H2S under the various experimental conditions using polarographic sensors to detect H2S.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313527</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We used heterologously expressed ion channels to demonstrate that H2S activates several specific TRP channel including TRPA1, TRPC4, TRPM2 and TRPM4 but not TRPV1. These actions were not due to disruption of S-S bonds nor mediated via PLC pathways. Thus H2S may be an endogenous ligand for some TRP channel family members. 



We have established a complex interaction between enterochromaffin cells and sensory nerve terminals in the gut wall. H2S evoked afferent discharge was attenuated by blocking TRP A1 and involves release of ATP and 5-HT. We observed that EC cells express several TRP channels including TRPA1 consistent with a role of EC cells in luminal signalling. 



The H2S synthesizing enzymes (CSE and CBS) were shown immunocytochemically in enteric neurones and their gene expression demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa. Using a specific enzyme inhibitors to block CBS, we have demonstrated a role for endogenous H2S in mechanosensitivity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>TRP channels represent a tractable target for pharmaceutical intervention with respect to pain and inflammation. Understanding the role of H2S as an endogenous mediator could therefore provide opportunities for novel drug discovery. Recognising H2S as an endogenous ligand for certain TRP channel family members could be exploited in pharmaceutical screens. We have a legacy of a number of cell lines (HEK) that stably or inducibly express a variety of mouse and human ion channels, including TRP channels, homomeric and heteromeric P2X receptors and 5-HT3 receptors for use in future studies. The BON293 cells that we obtained from Dr Townsend in Texas are also a valuable tool for examining 5-HT release and are currently being employed in a collaboration with Bazbek Davletov to study vesicle trafficking and manipulation of snare protein using engineered botulinum toxins. We also have a range of PCR primers and antibodies for immunocytochemistry that we have made available within our research group examining sensory signally in the bladder and bowel. Gut tissue and primary cells (DRG and mucosal epithelial cells) have been frozen for future analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3EBF1EBB-406C-43C8-BC5D-2B6D4FA2E665</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3970162359.969841577827ed8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E1D417C8-98C3-4766-A91E-4A7BB99555D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The neurophysiology of hydrogen sulfide.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Inflammation &amp; allergy drug targets</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dee89b9606875501035b47971e3f89c9"><gtr:id>dee89b9606875501035b47971e3f89c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rong W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1871-5281</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc038c03823abf6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5CED2A02-2C59-4B8A-993B-68E0AA7D7681</gtr:id><gtr:title>Role of hydrogen sulfide in visceral nociception.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gut</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f93707a28b29134120e98a6a56c69953"><gtr:id>f93707a28b29134120e98a6a56c69953</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schemann M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0017-5749</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc031c031be7908</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CEA94388-11EB-4C04-B672-6D1CA1544D02</gtr:id><gtr:title>Abstracts presented at International meetings</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a323ab0167363635a058bc1489f95951"><gtr:id>a323ab0167363635a058bc1489f95951</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>David Grundy (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_3757451673140c806e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FE0C3EB8-4CBC-4785-8573-6E5F693527A3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Neurophysiology of Hydrogen Sulfide</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Inflammation &amp; Allergy - Drug Targets</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dee89b9606875501035b47971e3f89c9"><gtr:id>dee89b9606875501035b47971e3f89c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rong W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d084084fcb579b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66D55AC1-5599-48C3-8A8D-7D2357D9B766</gtr:id><gtr:title>Signaling mechanisms involved in the intestinal pro-secretory actions of hydrogen sulfide.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a5f4c5809ea73cfcec57b8cb421d8bf1"><gtr:id>a5f4c5809ea73cfcec57b8cb421d8bf1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Krueger D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1350-1925</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_5435af45af44ee04a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G022445/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
