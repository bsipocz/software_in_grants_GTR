Developing a peer-led educational resource to address sexual risks among young people.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K005650/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This Knowledge Exchange project is a joint activity between ARK ? a joint initiative by Queen?s University Belfast and the University of Ulster - and Brook Northern Ireland (Brook NI). It is based on data collected in the 2010 and 2011 Young Life and Times (YLT) survey of 16-year olds (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ark.ac.uk/ylt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>www.ark.ac.uk/ylt&lt;/a>) which is undertaken annually in Northern Ireland. The YLT surveys had asked questions about sexual risks faced by young people and their sexual experiences.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main objective of this project is to facilitate sexual capacity and confidence building among young people in Northern Ireland who are at the start of their sexual careers, ie. who have not been sexually active or have only been sexually active for a short period of time. This will be done by:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>collecting a boaster sample for the YLT surveys, to inform&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>participatory group work sessions with up to 100 young people&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the development of an educational resource and young people-led publicity campaign about sexual safety.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project is undertaken in a participatory manner. 12 peer educators ar trained who will help with the group discussions and with the design of the education resource and campaign.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will contribute to the use of attitudinal social science data in a practice context. ARK already routinely disseminates social attitude data to a wider non-academic audience, however, this project will directly contribute to the translation of social science data into educational initiatives and resources. Furthermore, in Northern Ireland the subject area of sexual health is also characterised by a shortage in routinely collected social data, thus this initiative would provide a rare opportunity to make a social and policy impact in a sensitive subject area. Data on sexual grooming and sexual risks for young people had not been collected in Northern Ireland prior to the 2010 YLT survey. Unlike in Britain where sexual attitude and behaviour data is also routinely collected through the NATSAL surveys, in Northern Ireland, which is excluded from NATSAL, no such regular sexual health data collection takes place. The 2011 YLT survey was the first large scale randomised population survey of young people in Northern Ireland which included sexual behaviour questions. The Towards Better Sexual Health project(Schubotz, Simpson and Rolston 2002) still remains the most comprehensive sexual health study in Northern Ireland, however the sample frame at the time was opportunistic rather than randomised. 
 
The target user community for this project, in particular for the publicity campaign, are young people generally. Brook NI is by far the largest provider of sexual health services for young people in Northern Ireland, and is thus an ideal partner for this project. The education resource and publicity campaign will be developed, and will be suitable, for a broader audience of young people. However, we endeavour to particularly reach out to young people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, young people aged 14 or younger at risk of becoming sexually active at an early age or already active, and those young people who identify as other than heterosexual. The YLT surveys identified these grups of young people as particularly at risk. The training resource will be suitable for Sexuality and Relationship Education in schools as well as out-of school group work. the resource will be used by Brook outreach and information workers, however, it will also be available to other organisations working with young people, in particular in the area of sexual health promotion.

Young people participating in the interactive development of the reources will themselves benefit from capacity building and will acquire new skills and knowledge.

Staff and volunteers at Brook NI will benefit from their involvement in this project, again primarily through new skills acquired. We anticipate positive outcomes for Brook NI as an organisation and subsequently an increase in the numbers of young people taking part in information sessions provided by Brook and an increase in outreach activities. Both the education resource and the publicity campaign will contribute to the visibility of the organsiation, and we anticipate that this will have a positive outcome on future funding applications. However, the impact of this project would be visible beyond Brook itself. Overall, we would anticipate an improvement in the sexual health among vulnerable young people, especially an increase in their awareness of, and their resilience towards, sexual risks they may face.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6084</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sexual risks and exploitation among young people in Northern Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>37EC0494-28ED-4FD4-B0F1-18CF9BDAFF6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Submission made to the Child Sexual Exploitation enquiry held by Northern Ireland's Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA).

Educational material (website posters) which were produced during the Knowledge Exchange project have been made available to sexual health providers in Northern Ireland. The website which was developed during the project is also available through the Brook Young People website and is therefore promoted not just in Northern Ireland, but UK-wide. Several conference presentations were given and workshops facilitated, for example at the 2013 Northern Ireland Sexual Health conference, the launch of the 2014 Sexual Health Week in the Stormont Parliament building, and an ARK seminar directed at policy makers working in the sexual health field in Northern Ireland.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5EF21422-2809-4BD3-A787-D70E273B3926</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546dd32e8e5739.42333604</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>More education programmes are needed to address sexual risks and exploitation among young people. These should be offered in schools, but should also be made available outside the school context as many schools are restricted by their 'school ethos' or their governance in the way they address sexual health needs. These are often limited by social and religious norms and views on how young people 'should' behave, failing to recognise the actual sexual lifestyles that many young people lead and, by doing so, actually putting young people at greater risk. 
In particular young people form disadvantages backgrounds and those who have been sexually attracted to, or had sex with, people of the same sex are most vulnerable to sexual exploitation, risks, and risk-taking behaviour</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We produced educational resources - a website and promotional posters - base don our research and the engagement with young people which is freely available to use by young people and education providers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4F07E4F1-65C8-43A6-9E11-FD3F95580EAF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546dd66b11c2d1.51808528</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ark.ac.uk/ylt/results/YLT-Brook-KE-project.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>SPSS dataset from survey data collected during this KE project.
