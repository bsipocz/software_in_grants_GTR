At the same time, according to the World Energy Outlook Report of 2014, existing methods of secondary oil recovery still leave from 30 to 60% of oil unrecovered when an oilfield is abandoned as 'exhausted' and the exploration moves to a new one. This is both inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. To reach the unrecovered oil and reduce the pace of expansion into new oilfields until renewable power generation becomes an economically viable alternative, it is necessary to develop efficient methods of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). 

EOR is focused on recovering oil blobs trapped in the porous rock, known as 'ganglia', that remain stuck after the water-flooding 'secondary recovery stage'. The aim of EOR is to mobilize the ganglia by some additional physical mechanisms. The opposite problem is carbon dioxide sequestration; a process aimed at reducing the pace of climate change. There, it is absolutely essential that carbon dioxide volumes pumped into a porous layer remain there without escaping back into the atmosphere. In each case, the trial-and-error assessment of the efficiency of recovery or storage is prohibitively expensive, so that here theoreticians have a unique role to play by developing a predictive mathematical model that would reliably describe the conditions for mobilization and the dynamics of mobilized trapped fluid volumes in different porous matrices. 

The proposed research aims at addressing this dual problem. It has become possible as a result of two recent developments:
- an experimental discovery at Schlumberger Gould Research Centre, Cambridge that the ganglia trapped in a porous rock can be mobilized by fluctuations on the scale of the individual pores which can be generated even when the external forcing is steady 
 - a new conceptual framework for describing the propagation of wetting fronts, developed by the project's investigators, which for the first time describes highly unusual ('anomalous') regimes of invasion of liquids into porous solids, that were discovered experimentally two decades ago.

The synergy of these two developments opens a way to the first reliable predictive model describing the stability and dynamics of ganglia in porous solids. The potential for the field-transforming changes has been recognized by industry, and Schlumberger, the world's leading supplier of technology solutions for the oil and gas industry, has offered to support the project by releasing its experimental data (conservatively estimated at &amp;pound;715,000 to generate) and the help of its staff to interpret them (&amp;pound;15,000 in the staff time) as well as training of the PDRAs involved in this work.
 
On the theoretical side, the proposed work addresses a number of fundamental research challenges in the mechanics of multiphase systems such as the translation of the pore-scale information into the properties of a macroscopic (Darcy-scale) model and the modelling of transitions in the topology of the flow domain (breakup of ganglia, their coalescence). Advances here will make a significant methodological impact on mechanics of multiphase system well beyond the study of flows in porous media. The degree of novelty and adventure in the proposed research is best illustrated by the fact that, even knowing the two developments listed above that form the basis of the project, it is still impossible to even qualitatively predict the effect of their synergy. If supported and successful, the project offers a step-change advance in our understanding of multiphase systems and, via Schlumberger, an immediate application of results.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The continuing increase in demand for hydrocarbons both for energy (85% of supply) and for chemical feedstock (15% of supply) combined with gradual depletion of known oil and gas reserves as well as the reduced rate of discovery of new reserves mean that nurturing currently known fields to maximise recovery is becoming the necessity. The situation also has an important environmental dimension as currently, according to estimates, from 30-60% of oil is left unrecovered when an oil field is abandoned as 'exhausted' and the exploration moves to a new one. More efficient oil recovery would help to reduce the pace of this expansion until renewable power generation will be able to take over. All these factors make it necessary and economically viable to develop efficient methods of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).

This project will explore a new mechanism of mobilization of oil that currently remains unrecovered and hence make a major advance in the development of novel EOR strategies, thus addressing the strategic objectives identified in the Government report &amp;quot;UK Oil and Gas - Business and Government Action&amp;quot;. 

The impact of this project is ensured (a) by the power of combining theoretical modelling, numerical simulation and, importantly, experimental verification of the results with the complementary benefits of academia and industrial environments, and (b) by the direct involvement of Schlumberger, the world's leading supplier of technology, integrated project management and information solutions to customers working in the oil and gas industry worldwide. The technological solutions that are expected to come out of this project will find immediate use via Schlumberger Gould Research Cenre (Cambridge), which contributes &amp;pound;730,000 in terms of information and manpower towards this project. 

Thus, in the short term, the project's findings will be implemented into and have an impact via Schlumberger's EOR strategies, with the obtained knowledge becoming part of the computatinal platforms used to predict and estimate the efficiency of EOR. This will ensure an immediate impact on the oil-recovery companies served by Schlumberger to increase their productivity and efficiency of their operations. For the UK, being world-leading in this direction of research will bring significant economic gains, such as through the creation of high-skilled jobs in industry, as well as societal impact, by optimizing the recovery of our own reserves of oil in the North Sea and thus bolstering our energy security. 

Longer term impact will come from the theoretical advances made in the modelling of flow through porous media, which is central to fields as diverse as carbon dioxide sequestration through to understanding the spread of contaminants via groundwater flow, as well as in related strands of multiphase systems, such as the spreading of liquids across rough or inhomogeneous solids. Here, fundamental advances will stimulate research in academia (mathematicians, engineers, physicists, computer scientists, etc) by applying the methods developed during the project's duration to related branches of science. This transfer of knowledge will be facilitated through publications, conference talks and a workshop designed specifically with this aim in mind.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>445133</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P020860/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
