It is above all, however, the works of the early Soviet period (early 1920s-late 1930s) that are familiar to non-specialists. Less well-known are the excellent films made in the late Soviet period; and particularly, not many discussions have dealt with the mechanisms of film production and reception. The project that I intend to research focuses on the post-Stalin decades, a period that saw perhaps the greatest flowering of the Leningrad State Film Studio, Lenfil'm. Its output was extremely varied, including, for instance, fantasy/science fiction (Amphibian Man, 1962), Cold War thrillers (Dead Season, 1968), a TV adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, Soviet romcoms (The Blonde Round the Corner, 1984, and Winter Cherries, 1985, with sequels dating from 1990 and 1995), family dramas (Blame Klava K. for my Death, 1979). Many of these films were among the most successful produced in the Soviet Union at the period, in terms of numbers of viewers and lasting appeal (all are now available on the Russian internet). Alongside this, Lenfil'm had a remarkable art film tradition, with directors such as Grigory Kozintsev, Il'ya Averbakh, Dinara Asanova, Aleksei German, Vitaly Mel'nikov and others creating a distinctive house style that - in the case of the younger directors - was characterised by its documentary feel paradoxically allied with a strong sense of self-conscious awareness of film as art. Frequently, films were shot so that the viewer was aware of the process by which the film was created; notable was Averbakh's The Voice (1982), whose central figure is an actress engaged in making a film, who herself appears in-shot with a still camera. Also striking, particularly in German's work, is creative scrutiny of the Soviet past, above all the Stalin era (Ivan Lapshin, 1984, and Khrustalyov, My Car, 1998). As the period when this extraordinary creativity took place recedes into the past, and with the future of the studio itself uncertain, it is important to collect documents, photographs, and oral history before they vanish for good. Research on Lenfil'm will also give a sense of the geographical spread of outstanding film production (commonly, work focuses on Moscow - as in the constant citation of Vladimir Mel'nikov's Moscow Doesn't Believe in Tears (1980), often presented as the most significant film produced immediately before glasnost). This study dedicated to one important aspect of late Soviet public art, drawing on oral history and archive work in, for example, the studio's own archives as well as state archives in St Petersburg and Moscow, will make a significant contribution to the understanding of change in so-called 'official' art forms at a period when some of what they produced could be as scandalous as actual 'underground' art. (Some films, such as Leave in September (1979) remained 'on the shelf' for years after they were produced.) Alongside this case study with broad implications, I intend to initiate a wide-ranging discussion of late socialist culture through the organisation of two international workshops in which leading scholars, especially younger scholars, who have done cutting-edge research on the last decades of Soviet power will be able to discuss key issues of social, cultural, and economic change in an imaginative yet focussed way. My position as President of the Association for the Advancement of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (the first not based at a US university) will allow me to showcase key debates on late Soviet culture at the ASEEES annual convention, where I plan to organise two panels. Seasons of films showing major masterpieces of Lenfil'm, which I hope to organise with the co-operation of the BFI and Russkyi Mir, will make this corpus of outstanding material available to the broader public, and help to strengthen the interest in the Soviet cinema of this era that is now starting to emerge</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I have extensive experience of dissemination beyond academic audiences, and of successful impact, including outside the UK (as indicated by e.g. online comment and reviews in Russia). I will draw on this experience when promoting the events for which I have requested sponsorship. I will use the project website and newsletters, as well as the mailing lists of general interest organisations (e.g. Russkyi Mir, GB-Russia Society), and social websites (I have a substantial list of followers on Facebook) in order to promote events, and will liaise with cinema specialists and organisations about the progress of the project. I plan a series of outreach events as part of the project. One of these is a special season, 'Lenfil'm and Beyond', comprising films made in Leningrad and St Petersburg and by directors from there, which I will invite the distinguished film director and long-term Leningrad/Petersburg resident, Alexander Sokurov, to select and discuss (I have begun preliminary discussions with the British Film Institute about the possibility of collaboration). Film showings in Oxford will attract the interested public, including the expatriate network as well as cinema enthusiasts, to this important cinema legacy. Both these events would be accompanied by an exhibition or virtual exhibition of cinema posters. I will also seek to promote and showcase my own research, and the research presented at the workshops, by making organisers of outreach organisations such as Pushkin House in London and Grad gallery aware of the events and suggesting collaborations and joint presentations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>193589</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Version with English subtitles</gtr:description><gtr:id>F4284081-A58E-4586-B6F6-90682132065A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film is available on Youtube and other internet sites, but exclusively in Russian-only versions, which makes it inaccessible to non-specialist audiences in the Anglophone world.

The gala evening in London was reported in the Evening Standard and on Channel 1 (the main state TV channel in Russia), who carried out a short interview with me. So far as PR and press contacts go, the connection has been helpful, but most important of all is the support of a specialist foundation at a stage when I am still finding my way in the world of Russian cinema.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have been working with Kino Klassika Foundation, an educational charity whose purpose is the promotion of classic Russian films, towards an exhibition on the city in Petrograd and Leningrad cinema, planned for 2018.

I also introduced Kino Klassika to the staff of Seans, an educational foundation promoting Russian cinema in St Petersburg. This led to an invitation to Justine Waddell, the Executive Director of Kino Klassika, to present their programme for 2017 at the St Petersburg Cultural Forum, and Sasha Ahmadshina, the Events Director of Seans, has been working with us on planning the exhibition. I also introduced Pudovkin's The End of St Petersburg at a gala fundraising evening in London and have put Justine in touch with a former graduate student who runs a subtitling business.

Another high point was collaboration with Seance. I helped draw up a list of speakers for a conference in December 2016 held as part of the St Petersburg International Cultural Forum, and myself presented a talk on Lenfilm as part of the event.

I have identified 1961 as one important point of transition (a major studio reorganisation), and 1971-2 and 1978-9 as others (several films not cleared for release, financial problems, and removal of the director). I firmly now intend to focus on young directors and films about contemporary life, using others as background material. I have decided also to make the emotional register of the films a central object of investigation, since this was an area where young directors were acknowledged to make an important contribution. Senior directors could (and did) lay claim to more life experience and technical expertise, but strength of feeling was assumed to be a marker of youth, so the junior directors could attain authority in this area. I am also attracted to the analysis of emotional registers because these lay bare ways in which meaning worked indirectly. For example, Gennady Shpalikov's film A Long Happy Life is often interpreted (and was so interpreted in studio discussions) as a story about love at first sight. This has left many viewers puzzled about the film's apparent coldness. Using material from Shpalikov's poetry and attention to the camera work and dialogue, I argue that the film in fact primarily addresses the topic of indifference -- and specifically, the reluctance of the migrant hero (he is a geologist) to settle in a specific place and with a specific person. The emphasis on emotional register and its ambiguities has also provided a way of mediating between studio history, which I have researched extensively, and the film texts themselves. For instance, in a chapter under the title 'More in Expectation than Hope', I show how the remarkable artistic success of Naum Birman's Chronicle of a Divebomber (1968) was attributable not to the original script (which was, by common consent, a fairly standard wartime air force story), but to a mixture of mishap (the studio could not get reproduction aircraft to fly convincingly and there were no real ones of the right type) and collective creative activity. The designer and camera operator produced a solution - filming the action round stationary aircraft - that turned the film into a remarkable drama of frustrated action, rather than the planned action movie, while a song by Aleksandr Kolker added at a very late stage evoked and enhanced the atmosphere of the fog-bound airfield that became the setting for this drama. In showing how camera crews and other studio staff worked 'to overcome adversity' (to quote a phrase used by one of our informants), I aim to reexamine the standard model of 'creativity versus censorship', arguing that ideological control was just one element in the complex process of film production. 
Alongside these insights (to be incorporated in my monograph on Lenfilm, of which I have written about a third in draft form), I have also worked on a detailed study of control over film production by Party bureaucracy inside and beyond the studio, arguing that alongside its notorious function as an instrument of ideological manipulation, the Party also played a central role in day-to-day management (as the only management structure that embraced all the different divisions, artistic, technical, and administrative, of the Leningrad 'film factory).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Judging by the papers that I have presented so far, this research is of considerable interest both to cinema specialists and to others. It provides a sense of how Soviet cultural industries worked and also of corporate values in a major enterprise (over 3000 staff). The role of the Communist Party in the organisation (for practical as well as ideological management) has been a revealing side of the work that I have done in local archives. The substantial article (about 25,000 words) that I have written on this will be posted on the Internet (e.g. academia.edu), but the materials will also be used by Seans cinema education foundation in St Petersburg, in particular for their 'Chapaev' portal, an online encyclopaedia of resources on the Russian cinema that is intended as an authoritative educational and informational resource. My collaboration with Seans and with Kino Klassika Film Foundation allowing me to disseminate my research to a wider public in Britain and Russia has been one of the most enjoyable parts of the work on this project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C8E29130-FCD4-4094-A8CB-9E9F8B6AFD41</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d0b2824bb778.35277278</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>14ECB5AB-8511-49C7-B5A9-400FDDE4F33B</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Period zapoya&amp;quot;: p'yanstvo v sovetskom kino pri Brezhneve</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Novoe literaturnoe obozrenie</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ecf870cc9bb5a821857262cb7888c9ce"><gtr:id>ecf870cc9bb5a821857262cb7888c9ce</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelly CH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ade0371bb9c3.34857309</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M005682/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CF24A29E-2336-4837-A7A0-C163D5D3DE6D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Russian, Slavonic &amp; E European</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
