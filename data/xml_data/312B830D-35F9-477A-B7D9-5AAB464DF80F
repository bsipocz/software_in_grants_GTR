The town's iconic landmarks of the Tower, Pleasure Beach, Prom and Piers provide a backdrop for busy summer seasons followed in autumn by the famous Illuminations. However, for those living in large parts of Blackpool, life paints a very different picture. Government statistics rank Blackpool was as England's 4th most deprived region with only 43% of pupils obtaining 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE and less than 12% entering Higher Education. 

This Leadership Fellowship in Public Engagement (PE) is in collaboration with Blackpool Council and seeks to inspire young people in the town into engaging with and subsequently pursing a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This will provide them with better future career prospects as well as build a more skilled workforce within the region. The work will also train other researchers to undertake similar approaches to engagement in other parts of the country. There are three strands:

1. The Fellowship will allow me to engage with a specific group of young people from these deprived areas over a three-year period from Year 6 (Primary) through to Year 8 (Secondary). This engagement will consist of school visits by myself and other astronomers, community events and trips to specialised UCLan facilities. These are the UCLan/Ri Young Scientist Centre (YSC; a vibrant laboratory space dedicated to offering interactive STEM workshops) and Alston Observatory (a teaching and PE facility that houses both modern and historical telescopes, exhibitions and a planetarium).

Each event will have a lesson plan of what is to be achieved and how it will be evaluated. Example activities include building a Mars Rover through to living close to our stormy Sun. The focus will be on inspiring young people to engage in STEM and so spark their aspiration of pursuing a career in science. An annual workshop for the participating teachers will be held along with an annual community-based mini-science festival to which the families of the pupil cohort will be invited. 

2. It is important to use the opportunities that arise from this work to train scientists in PE. Researchers from all over the UK will be invited to join in the YSC activities to experience for themselves how best to work in this environment. On visits to schools, I will also take with me early career researchers from my own university. Both of these activities have the important element of the pupils themselves meeting inspiring scientists who can be role models for them.

3. In 2016, UCLan delivered an STFC-funded interactive astrophysics exhibition and art installation project in Whitehaven, Cumbria (see a short movie at https://gmoo.gl/bB9gUC ). Thus I will use the opportunity of the Fellowship to pursue this work further in Blackpool. The Council are keen to see these PE opportunities being associated with what the resort is best known for. This includes;
- Astrophysics at the Blackpool Illuminations: The art installation above consisted of a large, semi-circular projection of solar images along with a specially composed soundtrack and an Sun educational movie. I will collaborate with the Blackpool Illuminations team to assess the most impactful way of developing this science imagery.

- Dance workshops: With the famous Tower Ballroom, the resort is synonymous with dance of all types. With Blackpool Council, I will investigate working with appropriate local dance groups to employ and adapt the astronomy dance workshops previously developed. 

- Science Stand-up Comedy: Blackpool's comedy heritage is unsurpassed. Yet the interest in science stand-up has not touched the resort. One appropriate route to introduce this would be to host a &amp;quot;Bright Club Blackpool&amp;quot; (www.brightclub.org). Collaborating with the Council provides a route to working alongside venues and seeking sponsorship accordingly.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108074</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R001235/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
