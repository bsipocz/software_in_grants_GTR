systems</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N034228/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Most of the world's population is now living in cities and travelling more. As a result we are more likely to come into contact with infections that we would not have been exposed to just a few decades ago due to interactions with more people. The environment plays an important role in the transmission of some infections and it is possible to reduce the transmission of such disease by better filtration of water and air. Some filtration systems are currently used which physically stop pathogens such as bacteria. However these systems cannot stop virus particles, are expensive, require frequent maintenance and careful disposal. 

The aim of this project is to design one air and one water filter which will actively kill bacteria and viruses, thereby reducing their numbers in the environment. These filters will require less maintenance and be inexpensive to produce. During the project, we will first test the antimicrobial effect of a variety of nanoparticles. These will then be modified chemically so that they can be incorporated into materials that are suitable for water and air filtration. The filters containing the antimicrobial nanoparticles will be produced using a new EPSRC funded spinning technology developed at UCL. Once we have produced the antimicrobial filtration materials, we will test their ability to kill viruses in air and bacteria in water. We will test filters with different concentrations of antimicrobial nanoparticles and with different depths. We will also make sure that the filters are effective at flow rates that are used in the real world. 

The antimicrobial filters will be of most interest to the healthcare industry in the first instance, but they will also be relevant to busy public buildings (such as schools and care homes) and transport vehicles (such as airplanes). Furthermore, the filters will be capable of oxidising non-biological materials, like tar and pollution particulates and will improve air quality in a range of indoor environments. During the project we will be collaborating with industrial partners (including Pall Corporation, the world's biggest filtration company) and clinicians to ensure that we produce a viable product. At the end of the project, the technology will be validated and ready for scale-up production and we plan to apply for further funding for a collaborative project with industry in order to do this.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>UK and international industry and the economy
Industry will benefit from the proposed project on a number of levels. Initially, they will be involved in the proposed research project (2-3 years). This involvement may lead to new collaborations with academics and the exchange of knowledge. In the longer term, the current project is likely to lead onto further research project to scale-up the technology (4-6 years). Finally, the IP generated in this and follow-on projects is likely to lead to the manufacture of actively antimicrobial filters which will be of economic benefit to the companies involved, UCL and the economy more widely (7-10 years). 

Policy makers
The research undertaken will be of interest to UK and international policy makers who are involved in the shaping of policy for the reduction of infectious disease transmission in the hospital environment (7-10 years). Research outcomes are likely to lead to an improvement in evidence-based policy to reduce the spread of infections including healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance. One example would be in helping to refine the UK Government's 5-year AMR strategy. 

Healthcare providers, healthcare staff and the NHS
Healthcare providers will benefit from the research outcomes in the longer term (7-10 years). The proposed project will lead to IP and is likely to lead to the manufacture of antimicrobial filters which reduce the numbers of pathogenic microorganisms in hospital air and water systems. The installation of such filters will reduce the risk of transmission of infections from the environment within the hospital setting, which will in turn lead to better patient outcomes, shorter hospital stays and a decrease in costs. The costs will become lower both directly, though lower maintenance costs of filtration equipment, and indirectly through better patient outcomes. 

Patients and the public
In the long term (10-20 years), hospital patients and the public will benefit from the technology developed. The antimicrobial filters will reduce the numbers of pathogenic organisms in hospital air and water systems which will, in turn, reduce infection rates, hospital stays and improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, the technology is very likely to rolled out further to other environments such as transport vehicles (e.g. airline industry) and public spaces such as schools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>532526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Although the project is at a very early stage, we have been speaking to UCL Business about the process of filing a patent application to protect the process of producing the antimicrobial fibres using the pressurised gyration technique.
