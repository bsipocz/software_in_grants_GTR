At their most extreme these difficulties involve high levels of criminal offending and violence. For over 200 hundred years efforts have been made to diagnose these individuals as though they suffer from a mental disorder. Various labels have been used to describe this disorder - for example 'moral insanity', 'sociopathy', 'psychopathy' and personality disorder; with most concern in recent years being addressed to those said to suffer from 'Antisocial Personality Disorder' (ASPD). 

This issue began to receive a great deal of Government attention in the late 1990s, when the then Labour Government became very concerned by the case of Michael Stone who was convicted of the murder of Lin and Megan Russell in 1997. Stone's psychiatrists had recommended his discharge from a psychiatric hospital some 18 months before the murders because, although they viewed him as disturbed and dangerous, they felt that he suffered from 'ASPD' which they believed could not be treated in hospital. The Government proposed a series of initiatives that were aimed at encouraging the NHS to engage with and treat problems that were attracting the label of 'personality disorder'. They also initiated a well funded programme called the 'Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder Programme' that aimed to treat serious offenders who were seen as suffering from this disorder. Research has suggested that these programmes have not been very successful. Nevertheless further initiatives have been planned. 

We believe that although there is benefit in understanding the psychology of such individuals there is a danger of too narrow a focus on the individual nature of these difficulties and of too little attention being paid to the social and cultural contexts that produce and sustain these problems. This seminar series will bring together perspectives from a range of academic disciplines along with professionals representing different aspects of the health and welfare services, and with service users who had direct experience of living with these difficulties. 

The first year will start with an event that focuses on historical perspectives. This is important as although the diagnosis has a substantial history going back at least 200 hundred years; that history is not always well understood and there is a danger that the lessons of that history are not utilized. We will also hold a seminar that looks at what can be learned from people's own experiences of having the diagnosis themselves and from those who work directly with people who have had that diagnosis. Another seminar will examine philosophical perspectives on the nature of these difficulties. Such diagnoses have consistently been subject to legal controversy as they raise questions as to the nature of individual responsibility. 

The central event of the second year will be one that examines the impact and implications of the way that these kind of problems have been represented in different kinds of media (from film, art, fiction to the news media). We suggest that media representations have been an important factor in constructing our understanding of these problems. We will also look at how useful concepts of 'personality disorder' are within the highly charged public debates about, on the one hand, the world of those who are dependent upon long term on benefits and on the other in the world of corporate greed. 

Cross disciplinary ideas from the first two years will flow into the events of the final year that will be used to understand and point towards solutions to specific difficulties such as the rather different relationships that men and women have towards violence and the specific issues of 'hate crimes and terror' and 'school shootings'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The social problems created by those whose behaviour falls under the category of 'Antisocial Personality Disorder' are considerable. Despite the recognition of these kinds of difficulties going back 200 hundred years, we are still struggling to find solutions. We are aiming this seminar series to have an impact on academic research and practice. We will do this by bringing together perspectives from a wide range of professional groups who work in this field, these groups will include (as evidenced by our list of participants): 

 - Psychiatrists
 - Clinical Psychologists
 - Social Workers
 - Psychotherapists
 - Probation Officers
 - Prison officers

We will reach people by using professional networks and bring these together with academic networks: 

 - International Association of Forensic Psychotherapists (Chris Scanlon is on the board)
 - Centre for History of Emotion (see letter of support)
 - Association for Therapeutic Communities
 - Media and the Inner World (see letter of support)
 - Association for Psychosocial Studies (UK- Psychosocial Network) (David Jones is on the Steering Committee)
- Emergence (a service user group for people who have had personality disorder diagnosis) 

We will also use these and professional networks to publicise calls for papers for all these events. This is important in that we want to bring together people who might be working in diverse areas. In addition:

 - A series website will be established 
 - A JISC mail network will be organised and all interested people encouraged to subscribe.

We aim to improve knowledge and practice in this area. The ideas emerging from this series will directly feed into a number of initiatives that are already running or are planned:

 - PGCert: 'Psychosocial Perspectives on Working with People with Personality Disorders'. This is a programme that is run collaboratively by Millfields/East London Hospital Trust and the School of Law and Social Science at the University of East London. This programme has been designed with input from service users. It has its first intake during 2013. All students will be encouraged to attend all sessions.

 - The seminar series will be made available to all probation officers on the 'Pathways project' (see DoH 2011) funded by the Ministry of Justice that involves Millfields (where Chris Scanlon is employed as Consultant Psychotherapist), Forensic Intensive Psychological Treatment Service (FIPTS), Forensic mental Heath Services, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and the Bracton Centre, Oxleas Mental Health Trust.

 - A cross disciplinary Professional Doctorate in 'Psychosocial Clinical Practice' is planned to run in the School of Law and Social Science, University of East London. All students will be encouraged to attend events.

 - Students on a range of Professional Doctorate programmes run in collaborative partnership between the University of East London and the Tavistock Foundation Clinic will be encouraged to participate. David Jones sits on the Tavistock-UEL Strategic Partnership Board.

The events will feed directly into a number of publication initiatives:

 - David Jones (PI) has already been commissioned already to write a book by Routledge with the title: Disordered Personalities and Crime: A Psychosocial History of 'Moral Insanity'. This is due to appear in 2014.

 - Co-investigator Chris Scanlon will work with Anna Motz to edit a book on 'Gender and Forensic Mental Health', which is an important theme of the third year. 

 - Chris Scanlon and David Jones will edit a cross disciplinary collection towards the end of the series that will directly draw from work that emerges during the series. 

 - We are already discussing special editions of the journals of 'Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society', 'Critical Social Policy', and the 'International Journal of Therapeutic Communities'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10004</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6BA383E6-580B-489E-876E-2CFFB2CAA26E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Moral insanity and psychological disorder: the hybrid roots of psychiatry.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>History of psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e05d62356ad4f3dfed7884ecd1367166"><gtr:id>e05d62356ad4f3dfed7884ecd1367166</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones DW</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0957-154X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>59c913c9cc0e72.42340637</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000911/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>2E3820F6-A419-46FD-9BC5-10419FA0F615</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000911/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>27549.52</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-01-13</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>36F00AC9-75E8-446E-8EA6-7990404C9284</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000911/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>10004.42</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2017-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7DBCDE7-FDA2-465A-8338-1DA4AD7B221D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Forensic Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
