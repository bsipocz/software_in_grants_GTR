Is it useful to think about labour law as a separate and coherent branch of legal studies and legal practice? If so, how should we define labour law? If we can define it with reference to a particular subject matter - labour law is the law that regulates 'x and y' - then what is the nature of that subject matter? If we can define it with reference to a particular set of policy aims - labour laws are those laws which seek to achieve 'w and z' - then what are those policy aims?\n\nTraditionally, labour law (also known as employment law or industrial law) has tended to be defined as the body of law which regulates employment relationships: relationships between employees and employers, and between trade unions and employers. When thinking about the policy aims of labour law, reference has often been had to the idea of an inequality of bargaining power in the relationship betweeen an individual employee and his employer. Usually, it is said, an employer has more bargaining power than an employee. Where that is the case, the employer is able to insist upon those terms and conditions of employment which suit it best - for example, a low wage, long working hours, few benefits in terms of holidays or sick pay or pensions. Given this inequality of bargaining power, the defining policy aims of labour law have been said to revolve around the protection of the employee from the possibility that the employer might insist upon unfair terms and conditions. Law should be used as a tool, so the argument goes, to limit the freedom of the employer to decide terms and conditions unilaterally, and to ensure that employees are treated fairly, that the conditions they work under are safe and not deleterious to health, that they are paid at least a living wage etc. \n\nIn recent decades, the development of globalisation has caused many scholars to question such received wisdom regarding the scope and aims of labour law. It has been argued, for example, that in a situation of global competition between nation-states for capital investment, it does not make economic sense to limit the freedom of employers, by law, to set wages and other terms and conditions. High wages and high levels of protection of employees' rights will result in high labour costs which will be unattractive to capital investors. New ways of thinking about labour law should be found which recognise such economic truths. Labour laws should be made to work with, rather than against, the logic of global markets.\n\nThe research project aims to contribute to such debates. Specifically, it aims to return to the writings of two labour law scholars, Hugo Sinzheimer and Otto Kahn-Freund, who lived and worked during the earlier part of the twentieth century. The intention is to re-examine the writings of these scholars and to identify those elements which are of continued relevance when thinking about the scope and aims of labour law today. In particular, the project aims to examine the suggestion, supported by their writings, that labour law can usefully be thought of with reference to its 'constitutional function'. Broadly speaking, the idea of the 'constitutional function' is intended to highlight the role that labour law has played and continues to play in democratising employment relations and, more widely, in establishing democratic, fair societies. Having examined the idea of the constitutional function in the context of the nation-state (the UK and Germany), the project aims to consider whether the idea is of use in a globalised world. It looks, in particular, at the labour laws of the European Union, as a supranational entity, and at international labour laws. And it seeks to investigate how traditional labour law goals such as respect for human dignity, liberty and equality in the context of working relations might be pursued today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project is aimed primarily at an academic audience. The intention is to contribute to current debates among labour law scholars regarding the aims and scope of labour law under conditions of globalization. But that is not to say that these debates, and my contribution to them, are without relevance or interest to a wider, non-academic audience. To the contrary, questions regarding the appropriate aims and scope of labour law are of direct and practical interest to the public, particularly in times of financial unrest. Over the past few years, labour law (and, specifically, trade union law) has made the news headlines on a number of occasions. For example, during the dispute at the Lindsey Oil Refinery in 2009 questions arose regarding the hiring of foreign workers within the UK; the extent to which European Union law prevented policies of reserving 'British jobs for British workers'; and the potential consequences of the hiring of foreign labour for employment levels among British workers, and for the maintenance of long established terms and conditions of employment. More recently, disputes involving bus drivers, rail workers and British Airways cabin crew brought the law regulating industrial action to the public's attention. Widespread public debate was sparked regarding the importance of the right to stike as a democratic value, or fundamental human right, and the protection of the right in the face of economic crisis and failing businesses. At the same time, the judiciary was required to address the question of the significance of the European Convention on Human Rights (and, indirectly, of the jurisprudence of the International Labour Organisation and European Social Charter) for the interpretation and application of domestic law. \n\nThe research project will address all of these issues. As such, it will have implications for public policy, for judicial decision-making, and for the activities and strategies of trade unions and employers' associations. For example, the findings of the project relating to the appropriate aims of labour law could feed into public policy on the regulation of employment relations domestically and within the EU. The regulation of employment relations continues to form a central plank of economic and social policy at the national and European level. Following the financial crisis of 2007-2010, and the budgetary constraints that the crisis has brought with it, even settled policies are bound to be revisited. In this context, findings which relate to the compatibility of labour laws aimed at democratisation of working relations with economic objectives may be of particular relevance for questions of the benefits of regulation and deregulation. At the same time, those aspects of the project which emphasise the importance of labour law to the furtherance of democratic values will aim to caution against a purely economic analysis of the benefits and disadvantages of particular policies.\n\nThe part of the project that focuses on the European Union will make a special study of the status of labour laws and the collective representation of workers within the Union, and of the interaction of EU law and policy with national laws which seek to promote or guarantee labour rights. Given the direct and wide-reaching impact of EU law on UK labour markets, the findings of this part of the project will be relevant to policy makers, trade unionists and employers acting at EU level and domestically. Lastly, the findings of the project relating to the role and scope of labour law at the transnational level could feed into public policy regarding the significance of the International Labour Organisation and the international labour standards created and enforced by it. In particular, the emphasis given to the inter-connectedness of a variety of supranational institutions and texts may have policy imp</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65674</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B9BC90CC-08AE-477E-8FF1-566782751CF3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Right to Strike under UK Law: Something More Than a Slogan?: NURMT v SERCO, ASLEF v London &amp;amp; Birmingham Railway Ltd</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Industrial Law Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/68d8569ac2ced915f6b89af9f332a82b"><gtr:id>68d8569ac2ced915f6b89af9f332a82b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dukes R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f949949be277b3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4C60B038-1467-4E88-88D4-A3942532A84C</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Global Labour Constitution?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Northern Ireland Law Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/92d5ca5880c1b3a943765b7f7f3300f6"><gtr:id>92d5ca5880c1b3a943765b7f7f3300f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dukes, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>554350cc10cd43.93434803</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3618238D-99EA-4B97-94A9-974504536677</gtr:id><gtr:title>Resocialising Europe in a Time of Crisis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09500e6c3a8c8e2b66b9030237deb355"><gtr:id>09500e6c3a8c8e2b66b9030237deb355</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bogg, A; Dukes, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781107041745</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-914457273.58987313bea1466</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>19FF51DB-35E8-4FFC-B120-D83F95052BC4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Labour Constitution: The Enduring Idea of Labour Law</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f217fd30715816c043059be0ff5ecaa"><gtr:id>7f217fd30715816c043059be0ff5ecaa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dukes</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199601691</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>55434df8d86470.20763512</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I011684/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>84FAE587-7A8D-4EE4-9939-EE9AFF202021</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law Regulated By Statute</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>10601309-838E-4D0F-A4EE-B765E0CB1A81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
