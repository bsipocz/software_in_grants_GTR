For this purpose, two main activities are planned:
1- Holding a 5-day summer school in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, focusing on research methods in dementia. In each day, an invited UK-based researcher will give a mini-course during the morning, and have a research meeting in the afternoon to discuss potential partnerships with Brazilian collaborators. The courses are going to be free and open to any interested researcher or member of the public, with a few bursaries being provided to support attendance of students and researchers based in institutions in other cities of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The research meetings during the afternoon will gather a smaller audience of researchers working on similar topics.
Confirmed lecturers for the Summer School include:

Robin G Morris - &amp;quot;Impact of dementia from a joint neuropsychological and social science perspective&amp;quot;
Professor of Neuropsychology, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London
Robert Stewart - &amp;quot;The Dementia 10/66 research project - Epidemiological research into dementia in developing countries&amp;quot;
Professor of Psychiatric Epidemiology and Clinical Informatics, Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London
Richard G Brown - &amp;quot;A translational approach for dementia research&amp;quot;
Professor in Neuropsychology and Clinical Neuroscience, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London
Daniel Stahl - &amp;quot;Statistical methods for clinical trials and longitudinal studies&amp;quot;
Senior Lecturer in Biostatistics, Department of Biostatistics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London

At the fifth day of the summer school, a summit will be held with all the attendees and invited lecturers to discuss a blueprint for future collaborative research between the UK and Brazil on the topic dementia. A special issue on &amp;quot;Cross-cultural perspectives in the study of dementia&amp;quot; is planned, and this will also be discussed during the summit.
The summer school is going to be held at the Centre for Research and Teaching on Aging (CEPE), which is part of the Vital Brazil Institute, being funded by Rio de Janeiro's State Government. After the summer school, a network will be created in a social media platform to keep participants in contact and disseminate the summer school course information and discussions.

2- Visits by Brazilian researchers to the UK
These visits will happen 6 months after the summer school, with the main purpose to consolidate the partnerships established during the Rio meeting. Funding is requested for 3 visiting researchers staying an average of two weeks in the UK. The researchers visiting the UK will be selected on the basis of participation in the mini-courses, potential to develop partnerships with UK-based researchers and capacity to disseminate research findings (e.g. previous publication history).

At the end of the grant period, a videoconference meeting will be held to discuss the outcomes achieved by the project and potential follow-up proposals.

(text from previous partnership application form)</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact will be on improving the research infrastructure in Brazil to help improve the welfare of people with dementia and their carers. Expertise is needed to face the challenges posed by a rapidly increasing older adult population. Knowledge, including the skills base for helping promoting caring for people with dementia, will imparted by internationally recognised researchers in this field. An additional impact is fostering cross cultural research into dementia with the aim of enhancing a global approach to dementia. The project aims to benefit research both in Brazil and in the UK in this field with the ultimate aim of improving our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of dementia internationally, the focus being on social and psychological aspects of care from a cross cultural perspective. Ultimately it is envisaged that improving a cross cultural understanding of patients this will translate in to better service provision particularly in a Brazilian and UK multicultural context. The fostering of research is likely to have a lasting legacy in Brazil in terms of the development of specialist dementia research within the field of psychology and social sciences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29939</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>King's College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience</gtr:department><gtr:description>Brazilian Dementia Research Infrastructure Development</gtr:description><gtr:id>AB4F76AF-D9AB-4F5D-B5A7-BC884728D087</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As above</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56f2c949ef49e8.05740215-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>As above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Running a Summer School in Rio de Janeiro in March 2016 and hosting return visits in order to promote and facilitate research. This includes the setting up of the following projects linked to the King's College Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience

Dr Fl&amp;aacute;vio Luiz Seixas from the Institute of Computing, Federal Fluminense University, Rio De Janeiro and Dr Daniel Stahl from the IoPPN Department of Biostastistics are working on machine learning approaches to improving dementia diagnosis based on clinic data and using a large Brazilian cohort data set.

Dr Aimee Spector from UCL Psychology and Language Sciences is developing a large scale validation study of cognitive stimulation therapy in people with dementia in Brazil; Cognitive Stimulation is a UK therapeutic procedure that has been developed at UCL and is recommended by UK NICE Guidelines. The aim is to evaluate efficacy cross culturally, as well as helping develop this approach for Brazilian use.

Professor Robin Morris, Professor of Neuropsychology at the IoPPN and Professor Jerson Laks, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at the Federal University of Rio De Janeiro have set up a project converting a newly developed UK screening instrument for vascular cognitive impairment for Brazilian use, with Brazian validation for diagnosis of patients with cerebral small vessel disease.

Dr Daniel Mograbi, Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology, at the Pontif&amp;iacute;cia Universidade Cat&amp;oacute;lica, Rio de Janeiro and Professor Robin Morris have completed two publications relating to joint work between Brazil and the UK and are currently modelling conceptions of the self in relation to awareness of neuropsychological impairment in people with dementia. This work is to be presented at the International Neuropsychological Society Meeting in London, July 2016.

The project would Foster UK-Brazil collaborations in the context of dementia research, funding visits for researchers from both countries. It would aim to improve the ability of Brazilian researchers to undertake and disseminate research, leading to more dementia studies from this region with solid methodology and high impact.

In relation to these objectives, we had a very successful 'Summer School' (Brazilian Summer) 2nd to the 5th March 2015 in which four British scientists led workshops from the King's College Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience and also Psychology in UCL visited the Centre for Research and Teaching on Aging in Rio De Janeiro. This was attended by approximately 52 Brazilian researchers/ clinicians and during the workshop various collaborative projects emerged, followed subsequently:
