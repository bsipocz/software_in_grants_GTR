We often hear that dogs are highly skilled at responding to visual signals like pointing in comparison to other animals, yet we know very little about how they perceive our voices, despite the fact that we talk to them all the time. Many of us think that dogs understand us quite well, but what exactly do they hear when we speak to them? Can dogs interpret our tone of voice, recognise our words, or both? How do they learn their name, their owner's voice, or spoken commands? How can they pick this information out from our complex streams of speech? Do these learning abilities change over their lifetime, or depend on their social experiences with people? Are dogs naturally tuned into some aspects of our voices more than others, and can we use these biases to help them to learn to respond to us? Can this explain why we talk to dogs similarly to babies, rather than assuming that we only do so because companion dogs often seem to fall into a comparable role? There are so many questions that we do not have the answers for, yet these are important questions for social and training situations, where miscommunication can significantly reduce the quality of the interactions between people and dogs, and potentially lead to the compromised welfare of both participants. 
Our research seeks to address these questions by: a) documenting the development of human voice perception abilities in puppies, including direct comparisons with adult dogs to explore the influence of age and social experiences on these abilities; b) investigating whether some of the voice features that help human babies to learn object names can also influence learning in dogs, and if so, how; and c) determining how dogs cope with our often complex utterances in order to extract useful information. Our research team has the relevant strengths in the function and evolution of vocal communication and cognition in both animals and humans, as well as specific experience investigating dogs' perception of vocal cues. We propose to conduct a series of six multi-component empirical studies with puppies and adult dogs from different social backgrounds, that will address key research questions and test novel hypotheses in the key focus areas identified above.
This research will yield new knowledge in an under-researched topic, and illuminate an important aspect of dogs' social interactions with humans that has rarely been considered, yet is potentially of great importance. Our project includes core events that will showcase these results to a wide range of practitioners involved in dog welfare, training and management, as well as the general public. There will also be activities to supplement the professional development opportunities for school staff.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Speech is a key communicative mechanism widely used during human-dog interactions, often with the intention of manipulating dogs' behaviour. Despite this, while recent research advancements have determined that dogs are highly skilful in their perception of human visual gestures, their perception of human vocal signals remains surprisingly under-researched and poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this project is to significantly advance our understanding of the functional and mechanistic factors that determine dogs' perception of human speech. To do this, we will carry out the first systematic investigation to uncover the extent of dogs' abilities to perceive functionally relevant verbal and non-verbal speech cues. We will examine the ontogenetic development of key abilities by establishing how and when name and owner voice discrimination is acquired in puppies. Novel word learning abilities in puppies and adult dogs will also be directly compared to test the hypothesis that attentional biases to verbal or non-verbal cues within speech signals are dependent on cognitive development through maturation and/or prior learning. We will then contrast the specific effects of verbally-related and intonational voice features on attention, arousal and learning. We expect that the highly prosodic voice characteristics that humans naturally tend to use during their interactions with dogs may have a similar function to human infant-directed speech in modulating their responses. In the final phase of our project, we will determine the extent to which dogs can effectively compensate for acoustic variation caused by irrelevant verbal or non-verbal content in natural speech signals. Specifically we will test whether they are capable of speaker normalisation, and extracting words from fluent speech. Dogs' comparable responses to human infants in gesture interpretation suggest that they may also show similar compensatory abilities in perceiving human speech signals.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Defra's 'Code of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs' states that dogs should be provided with regular human interaction through play and training to behave normally and have a good quality of life. The proposed research will substantially improve our understanding of a central communicative mechanism for effective human-dog interactions, investigating how dogs perceive and extract information from our voices. We will determine the development of key human voice perception abilities in puppies and the cognitive mechanisms involved; promote objective expectations for voice command learning; and identify factors that facilitate or inhibit dogs' abilities to perceive speech cues. We therefore anticipate that the project outcomes will be of considerable interest to companion dog owners, who currently make up a quarter of the UK population, canine practitioners (e.g. Guide Dogs manage approx. 8,000 dogs) and Defra. By raising public awareness and understanding of dogs' speech perception abilities, the results of our research will have direct welfare applications, improving both companion and working dog management practices. 
Phase 1 of our project will provide the first systematic documentation of the development of essential human voice perception abilities in puppies. This will be particularly beneficial to dog breeders as the results will significantly advance our understanding of the normal perceptual and cognitive development of these crucial perceptual skills. The results will be used to improve puppy rearing practices by providing breeders with guidelines to monitor learning progression, and ensure that each individual is sufficiently exposed to human speech during critical developmental periods. In addition to companion dog breeders, our results pertaining to the development of human voice perception abilities in puppies will be highly useful for working dog organisations (e.g. Guide Dogs, Police, National Gundog Association). As the accurate interpretation of human speech is essential for dogs to perform successfully within in these industries, developing new monitoring and assessment tools for puppies will be especially advantageous. Such tools could reduce training failure rates (approx. 50%), avoiding unwanted individuals. 
A further outcome of Phase 1 will be to determine how age and experience influence dogs' learning of new voice commands. Our results will be useful for rescue centres (e.g. RSPCA, Dogs Trust), as the outcomes can be directly applied to relinquished dogs as an assessment tool to provide new owners with more accurate predictions of adopted dogs' likely responsiveness. Establishing realistic expectations is particularly important as around 12% of all adopted dogs are returned to rescue centres due to behavioural problems, causing considerable distress to both parties. 
Phases 2 and 3 of our project will focus on determining which voice cues are most effective in communicating with dogs, and how natural variation in these cues may hinder their perception. The outcomes will provide valuable information for dog trainers and behaviourists (e.g. Guild of Dog Trainers), as well as the general public, about effective communication between humans and dogs. Owners frequently use imperative instructions during their interactions with dogs, and miscommunication can foster perceptions of disobedience, increasing the likelihood of punishment and even relinquishment. By enhancing owners' knowledge of the effects of specific voice components on dogs' responsiveness (directly or indirectly by informing trainers), they will benefit from higher quality interactions, and therefore improved relationships, with their dogs.
During the project the RF will build their employment capacity by gaining new research skills, particularly in investigating ontogenetic development in animals and measuring physiological responses. Further professional skills will be obtained in project management and science communication.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P00170X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D5C57767-F44D-42BE-B074-C153A3C8EEA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Welfare</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>790AD28C-6380-4025-83C2-6881B93C4602</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal behaviour</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
