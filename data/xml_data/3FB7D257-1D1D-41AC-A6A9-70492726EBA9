(ii) Can banks overcome contract enforcement problems in offering ROSCA-like financial products?

These questions are directly motivated by recent research on microfinance, which suggests that savings products may be more useful for poor communities than loan products. To understand how savings products can be improved for the poor, we need to understand several important issues: Why don't the poor save more? How does household behaviour change when the household is a debtor, rather than a creditor? Can better microfinance products be developed to facilitate saving? These are the issues that underlie our research questions in this project. We anticipate that our research results will therefore have direct relevance to both policymakers and microfinance providers. If our product proves viable, it could provide small enterprises with a mechanism to increase investment and employment - and, in turn, to drive growth.

METHODS AND DATA: We will use a Randomised Controlled Trial. We will use a 'cluster-randomized' design, treating in some locations but not in others. In treated locations, we will (i) randomly assign firms to different positions in a rotating credit structure (see the 'Case for Support' for detail on the product), and (ii) randomly vary the interest rate. In total, we anticipate assigning 800 microenterprises to the new product, 800 as controls in the treated locations, and 800 as controls in untreated locations. We will stratify clusters by average cluster characteristics (specifically, the total number of clients at the branch, the number of female clients at the branch, length of branch operation, and average loan size made at the branch). Within treated clusters, we will stratify microenterprises by gender, sector of operation and baseline profits. A baseline and three follow-up surveys of the targeted microenterprises will be conducted at three-month intervals in control and treated locations, to form a four-wave panel. These surveys will include behavioural games, designed to explore the effect of time preferences, risk preferences, social preferences and peer pressure on take-up of the intervention and repayment/saving. We will also collect high frequency data using short phone surveys, and we will augment this sample with data generated by the bank internally.

DISSEMINATION: Most importantly, we will disseminate by close engagement with our partner bank, NRSP Microfinance Bank, who have expressed direct interest in our results. We will also run a workshop in Lahore at the end of our research to disseminate results to the local academic community and policy community. Finally, we will use CSAE's extensive dissemination network to share results with stakeholders in other contexts (for example, through the CSAE Briefing Paper series, designed to share policy-relevant results).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will engage with NRSP Microfinance Bank extensively during the design, implementation and evaluation phases of the products. We are currently running a pilot study, which will inform the design and implementation of the project. We will organize a workshop to discuss the findings from the pilot with NRSP Microfinance Bank's representatives, as well as with researchers from the Lahore School of Economics, and jointly plan the next steps. We will present the results from the product evaluation in a technical report for the NRSP Microfinance Bank and further discuss with the bank the viability of implementing the product on a wider scale.

We will share the results of our study to the wider financial and policymaking community in Pakistan, through workshops organised by the Lahore School of Economics. We will also publish a CSAE Briefing Paper to share our findings with the broader policy community. Finally, we will present our findings at academic conferences and publish them in economic journals, with the aim of reaching a wide audience within academia. 

We will monitor and evaluate the impact of our research in several ways. First, we intend to have a close ongoing relationship with NRSP Microfinance Bank, so we will have direct engagement in any future product roll-out based on our trial results. Second, we will monitor directly the academic impact of our research, through downloads and citations of our research papers. Third, we will keep track of the kinds of products being offered by large microfinance institutions worldwide. This is reasonably straightforward, given that large microfinance institutions make their product offerings public. 

Finally, we note that our research provides valuable new opportunities to build capacity in both Pakistan and the UK. Staff and students at the Lahore School of Economics will have the chance, by participating in the design, implementation and evaluation of the new products, to gain experience in conducting a large field project. Through their participation in research activities and dissemination of the results, they will enter in contact with academics and policy makers in the Pakistan, in the UK and abroad. UK-based members of the research team will have the opportunity to gain understanding of the Pakistani context, and to enrich their academic and policy network in the country. In order to facilitate knowledge exchange between the two countries, we will plan visits by researchers from Pakistan to the UK, and by UK-based researchers in Pakistan. These visits will be organised so as to maximise interaction during the design and implementation phase of the project, but also to enable researchers to communicate their findings to a broad audience in the two countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>455710</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L012286/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF887C15-B29F-4C4C-8420-88AF17A8FFE1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Financial economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
