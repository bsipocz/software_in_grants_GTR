Stemming from extant historical research in music, art and design / as well as extensive practice-based research / the project will offer visitors to the V&amp;amp;A and its website a multisensory experience of popular and elite culture in European, 1100-1800.\n\nNew and existing recordings of music will be integrated into two major projects:\n\n1. International Baroque: A temporary exhibition running from April to July 2009. The exhibition will travel subsequently to other international venues.\n\n2. Medieval and Renaissance Europe: A series of eleven new galleries opening in November 2009. The collection is one of the finest in the world and its redisplay will have a minimum lifespan of 25 years.\n\nThe unparalleled variety of musical styles, genres and instruments that is covered across this period requires musicological knowledge drawn from existing sources. The input provided by performers to early music scholarship is essential, particularly for the earliest works where hands-on music making is often the best means of addressing interpretative and notation questions. Much of this work has been embodied in performance and publication only in the last 40 years, with the weight of it in the last 25, and it is instructive to note that the RCM has trained many of the performer-scholars who are leading this field.\n\nRecordings will be embedded into the galleries, delivered through audio/video-points and through a dedicated website where music and images can be accessed and downloaded.\n\nThe project is distinctive in the quality of recordings to be made (in the research underpinning them and the standard of performance), in the extensive links between music and objects in the gallery displays, and in the application of state-of-the-art technology in delivering a multisensory experience for visitors (e.g. touchscreens with hi-definition headphones at audio/video-points throughout the galleries, and a website).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234685</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Recording of Baroque music.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA34CFE8-2642-4A64-A430-897D27E8AD37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Music students at the RCM who took part in concert performances have greatly benefitted, widening both their knowledge of performance practice and their professional skills in performance contexts.

The museum-going public: Visitors to Baroque 1620-1800 and Medieval and Renaissance Europe have experienced an enhanced understanding of the periods, places and people represented in the VAM's galleries. In addition, thousands of visitors to the VAM's website continue to benefit from the project, as recordings are available in their entirety online. The most important recordings include those of previously unedited music from major European libraries and recordings on original instruments from the RCM Museum. These sounds can now be accessed worldwide, and the music pages of the VAM website are in the process of being linked to the British Library music manuscript website.

The concert-going public: International audiences have congregated at the VAM for concerts and workshops on Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music delivered through the project. These have been supplemented by related lectures and masterclasses, also freely open to the public. 

Students: Music students at the RCM who took part in recording sessions and concert performances have greatly benefitted, widening both their knowledge of performance practice and their professional skills in performance and recording studio contexts. Over 40 students took part in the recording sessions, and more still are benefitting from new courses now available at the RCM. 

Performers and scholars: Our knowledge transfer activities were underpinned by innovative research in historical performance practice. The project team was interdisciplinary and has engaged with researchers in art and architectural history, decorative arts, archeology, literary studies, material culture studies, cultural history, music history, musicology, medieval instrumental music, medieval vocal music, Italian renaissance music, organology, German baroque music, performers and music publishers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EB1BA9F9-3E16-42EE-B890-7DE23CFEC40A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545a459ff04959.58558288</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Listening Gallery was a knowledge transfer collaboration between the Royal College of Music (RCM) and the Victoria and Albert Museum (VAM). Stemming from research in music, art, design, and technology, the project connected objects in the VAM's collections with music that shares their rich and distinctive pasts. New and existing recordings of music were integrated into two VAM projects: 

(1) Baroque 1620-1800: Style in the Age of Magnificence, the VAM's Spring 2009 exhibition, which ran from April to July 2009.

(2) Medieval and Renaissance Europe, a series of eleven galleries that re-opened after major renovation in December 2009. The collection is one of the finest in the world, and its redisplay will have a minimum lifespan of 25 years. 

Further information, including details of recordings, events, published reports and video documentaries, is available at the project website, www.rcm.ac.uk/listeninggallery.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One of the most innovative outcomes of the project has been the study and preparation (by Royal College of Music staff and students) of performing editions of previously unpublished music.
