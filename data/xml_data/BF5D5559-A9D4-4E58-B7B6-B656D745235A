One reason for this is that the reliability of electrical insulation systems, also found on our rail infrastructure, has proved extremely high. However much of the existing infrastructure is now very old, well beyond its design life. In addition, radical changes are now being implemented in power systems. These are largely driven by the desire to facilitate renewable (low carbon) energy supplies. Moreover as electricity replaces gas for heating homes, and electric vehicles replace petrol and diesel powered cars, more electricity will be consumed requiring greater densities of power transmission, particularly into our cities. These requirements necessitate higher electrical stresses on insulation and higher temperature ratings, whilst maintaining reliability. For these reasons improving our understanding of the failure mechanisms of insulation and designing improved insulation are both critical to the further development of our power systems. Reliability of insulation systems is also critical in power generation, rail networks and manufacturing industries.

This project will improve our understanding of insulation reliability and develop structured materials with improved performance. In particular a fundamental ageing mechanism in polymeric insulation known as electrical treeing will be studied in detail. Electrical tree growth is a mechanism of long-term failure in polymer insulation systems under high electrical stress and is a process leading to the development of an artefact which resembles a botanical tree. It consists of tubular hollow branches of up to tens of microns in diameter. The presence of a tree eventually leads to insulation failure. 
The project will consider how the use of layered dielectrics can enhance insulation life, particularly in the presence of electrical trees. Recent feasibility work between Prof Rowland (University of Manchester) and Prof Choy (UCL) has shown that thin layers of polymers can change tree propagation times by an order of magnitude. Also novel techniques in Manchester have now enabled three-dimensional imaging of the treeing process to be generated. This has used unique experimental facilities and skills for sample preparation at UCL and the imaging capability at the University of Manchester including the Diamond Light Source X-ray facility. 

Although this work is based on fundamental science, a key component of the project will be take the findings and develop a framework for improved layered dielectric structures. A route for future development of processes and products for the power networks, mass transit and power electronics industries will be developed. The commitment of external partners to generating this framework has been obtained to ensure technology transfer during the project life. Ultimately this work will contribute to better performing, lower cost and more robust electricity supplies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Sustaining reliable and affordable energy supplies is a major challenge in all countries. This has an impact on all aspects of life including heating, communication, transport and industrial/commercial competitiveness. There are also major technical challenges in preparing the UK's electricity networks for a low carbon future. Historically the reliability of electrical insulation systems, also found on our rail infrastructure, has proved extremely high. However much of the existing infrastructure is now very old, well beyond its design life. In addition, radical changes are now being implemented in power systems. These are largely driven by the desire to facilitate renewable (low carbon) energy supplies. Moreover if electric vehicles replace petrol and diesel powered cars and electricity replaces gas for heating homes, more electricity will be consumed requiring greater densities of power transmission, particularly into our cities. These requirements necessitate higher electrical stresses on insulation and higher temperature ratings, whilst maintaining reliability. For these reasons improving our understanding of the failure mechanisms of insulation and designing improved insulation are both critical to the further development of our power systems. Reliability of insulation systems is also critical in power generation, rail networks and manufacturing industries.

Better models of electrical tree growth and ageing in general are essential in managing existing plant, and the outputs from this work will enable Asset Managers to make more informed decisions concerning maintenance and replacement scheduling of existing equipment. This will support optimising the costs and reliability of the networks - a major issue across the globe. The development of improved dielectrics through appropriate filler loading and layering of polymers will provide new materials and design tools for equipment manufacturers. This in turn will increase reliability and reduce the size of high voltage plant, allowing the greater energy densities to be transmitted for future societal needs. Developments may also prove to be a key enabler of power electronics, and even low voltage applications if processing routes are developed for high reliability insulation.

The proposal is for basic research, but resource is planned, and support promised from key industries (network operators, a railway component manufacturer, a power system company, and an applied materials research institute) to enable the next stages of material, process and product development to be charted to ensure science generated is turned into engineering application, drawing in other interested parties as the program develops.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>548581</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>86208</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Centre for Doctoral Training in Power Networks at the University of Manchester</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Manchester</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>6F7F7DD2-7B95-421D-B2C1-3EC51BF89A4B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d570f38f35e9.18440682</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CA43C5DD-DF14-447E-A7A4-FAACB88F9AA6</gtr:id><gtr:title>A model and simulation of fast space charge pulses in polymers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a03b6f070728ac44072dc5204310b527"><gtr:id>a03b6f070728ac44072dc5204310b527</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lv Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7359ed277465.31382566</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BAB35F2E-1115-4173-93D2-4EBFBC96D61A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evolution of partial discharges during early tree propagation in epoxy resin</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a03b6f070728ac44072dc5204310b527"><gtr:id>a03b6f070728ac44072dc5204310b527</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lv Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7359ebc86bb2.45401855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>10D763D6-7CAA-4E95-B93D-7D2830CEA39D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The dynamic character of partial discharge in epoxy resin at different stages of treeing</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/79f226f09c4886e40d346eeaed82c03f"><gtr:id>79f226f09c4886e40d346eeaed82c03f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Iddrissu I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ab143b8a1393.70856779</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M016234/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
