Throughout the world, soil degradation impacts on the health, wealth and well-being of rural people in many different ways. Soils have a key supporting role in maintaining agricultural yields, water availability, water quality, resources for grazing animals and other ecosystem services. Some are perhaps less obvious but still valued such as maintaining habitats to support honey-bees and local wildlife. In Africa, soil degradation is recognised as a major constraint to alleviating poverty in rural communities. We have chosen to work in Ethiopia and Uganda where there are contrasting issues of soil degradation in mineral and organic soils are a result of agricultural land use but similar reliance in rural communities' on a range of benefits from soils. 

Solutions to soil degradation are not simple and require a much better understanding of how people benefit from soils, what they stand to gain if they can improve the condition of the soils that they manage whether for crops, livestock, timber production or as semi-natural areas, what they would need to do to accomplish this and what barriers may prevent this. In parallel we need to gain better insight into the likely success of different management options to improve soils. Ultimately these options will require some form of investment whether that be via money, time, resources or other mechanisms. We will investigate the relative pros and cons of these mechanisms from the perspective of local people, organisations involved with markets for Payments for Ecosystem Services and national objectives in alleviating poverty. A broader view of carbon benefits and trading is an opportunity to invest in lasting improvements in degraded ecosystems and the livelihoods of the poor that depend on these. 

All of this research and evidence building needs to be placed into the context of climate change. We need to establish that whatever might be suitable, acceptable and viable for tackling soil degradation now will have long-term benefits to local people and that these benefits will not be negated by the on-going changes to local climate. 

The ALTER project is an international consortium between The James Hutton Institute (UK), University of Aberdeen (UK), Hawassa University (Ethiopia), The Ethiopian Government's Southern Agricultural Research Institute (SARI, Ethiopia), Carbon Foundation for East Africa (CAFEA, Uganda) and the International Water Management Institute (Nile Basin &amp;amp; Eastern Africa Office, Ethiopia). This team brings together natural scientists, social scientists and economists to work together with rural communities and other local decision-makers and facilitators to improve our capacity to predict how human-environment linked systems respond to incentives and other drivers change. This predictive capacity is needed to be able to explore whether different options for change could result in substantive poverty alleviation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ALTER seeks to achieve high impact by developing and implementing a Pathways to Impact (PtI) plan that permeates and frames the expected outcomes of all project activities. This PtI has a statement of desired change, that &amp;quot;the overarching aim of ALTER is to establish whether investment in soil carbon can be used to alleviate poverty (in addition to or as an alternative to aboveground carbon) by restoring, enhancing or protecting the goods and services provided by ecosystems in regions where soils are degraded or under threat of degradation&amp;quot;. 
practices
The desired change as a consequence of ALTER's outputs is that soil degradation is reversed through management to achieve short- and medium-term benefits for poverty alleviation and enhance resilience of ecosystem services, whilst local, national and international capacity to invest in soil is achieved. 
The ALTER project would provide the evidence necessary for this change to be promoted by national and international organisations and to provide local people with sound knowledge of opportunities available to tackle soil degradation. We will seek to influence institutions and governance structures that most relate to poverty alleviation. These include National Development Plans and implementation of existing National Adaptation Plans of Action and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions. 
The PtI is developed in collaboration with local partners and structured to utilise the Theory of Change and ESPAs Impact and Knowledge Strategies, whilst building on partners' extensive range of experience in stakeholder engagement and research support for policy. There are many opportunities for developing metrics for measuring impact within the project. These include quantifiable measurements of soil carbon, fertility, primary production and flow of ecosystem services leading to poverty alleviation. ALTER will implement a set of Ideals: Innovation: improving on existing practises and building capacity; Inclusion: harnessing the potential of partners, collaborators and wider stakeholders; Implementation: showing how 'good practice' works; Linkage: linking up with previous and existing projects and programmes and Legacy: creating practises, attitudes and organisational structures that outlast the project. We will utilise the PtI Advisory Working Group (see Pathways document) to develop these metrics as appropriate to each location to ensure appropriate coverage and relevance. Whilst ALTER will report to the Research Outcome System, we will also seek to monitor flow of data and information through relevant organisations and maintenance of networks to ascertain the impact on achievement of the Statement of Desired Change.
By engaging with multiple stakeholders, from local communities, research organisations to regional and national government, we will develop working relationships that facilitate two-way dialogues with those we seek to learn from, inform and influence. We will map out networks of stakeholders to ensure an efficient process of engagement that provides a two-way flow of information between the multiple research disciplines. This enables the identification of key actors and targeting of influence efforts to increase the probability of effective change. Engagement with stakeholders, both within ALTER and wider networks will help ensure that all opportunities to influence the contextual drivers are taken. This presents a logical sequence through which ALTER will achieve the desired impact across multiple scales. 
We will develop multi-media approaches designed to suit the needs of the range of stakeholders involved. Effort will be channelled through a range of communication media: Policy engagement; Linking to other projects and initiatives; Social networking and new media; Extension services; Workshops; Master classes; Local internet; Academic; Government, planning and policy. The details of activities for each of these media are provided in the Case for Support WP4.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>87596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Wetlands Management Department (WMD)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Uganda, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Memorandum of Understanding with Wetlands Management Department</gtr:description><gtr:id>8191C4B2-A702-4383-90D8-264F51DA123A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Working to deliver ALTER outputs which are useful and useable by the WMD at national level</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>566a7153b052d6.57489448-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sharing of data</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Agreement for collaboration, sharing of data, incorporation of ALTER project outputs into WMD strategic plan objectives</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation and presentation at regional meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3247F638-DD99-4653-9384-AE9E94E8E398</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Attended the 2 day workshop and became a member of this network.

Muko is a degraded systems, where as Kashambya contains both degraded and intact wetlands. Topics covered include household infrastructure and assets, food security and shocks, land use and management and the use of ecosystem services. The survey also collected GPS coordinates.

A total of 427 interviews were completed through an android application: Open Data Kit (ODK). The survey was developed in English in paper form. The survey was then transcribed into excel and converted into xml format which could then be mounted onto the android phones. The data was downloaded off the phones and aggregated through ODK briefcase. 

The phone allowed either text box or multiple choice entries. Where multiple choice answers were used, these were either coded in lower-case English or directly into codes. A supplementary translation of these codes is attached, as well as the original XML code used. Where enumerators were able to write freely in text boxes, as opposed to multiple-choice, any Rukiga has been translated to English and remain in square brackets after the text. There is a summary tab to give an overview of the villages and numbers of surveys. 


During the period of 2/03/2015 to 20/03/2015 household surveys were conducted as part of the ESPA-ALTER project. 

? The survey design is broken down into the four following parts: 
o Part A: Household survey and capitals
o Part B: Food security and shocks
o Part C: Land use and management practices
o Part D. Cultural identity and contributing value of wetlands
? The design of questions and structure contained within the survey draw upon the following existing poverty-soils analysis and surveys:
? ALTER WP1 Ethiopian HH survey
? Uganda National Household Survey (UNHHS) 
? Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) 
? Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) 

? Key Informant Interviews conducted by WP1 Uganda in June 2014 were used to supplement material relevant to the field sites, and develop suitable option lists for multiple choice answers.

? Questions were also checked to make sure that the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) survey was sufficiently replicated to allow both forward and backward mapping and analysis from previous HH surveys through key questions.

? Enumerators were recent graduates from Kabale university and three days of training enabled a familiarity with the hh survey and further consensus in phrasing the question in Rukiga to elicit the information required. The training was also an opportunity to learn and develop interview techniques, and practise being both the respondent and the interviewer. 

? The training was also used to explore any technical issues arising with conducting the hh survey via phones.

? Villages (n=21) over two sub counties of Muko and Kashambya had been identified as those with a close proximity to the two wetland systems the ALTER project is focusing upon. 

? Household lists had been previously collected within these villages. Households were then assigned random selected.

? At each interview the project was introduced and permission sought to conduct the interview. Between 9 and 37 interviews were conducted in each village and working with five enumerators about 22 surveys were conducted each day. Interviews lasted between 40 minutes and 1.5 hours. 

ERROR CODES
All questions had to be answered for the questionnaire to proceed on the phone
Blank cells are the result of skip codes, to ensure only relevant questions were asked. 
777 - means that the question wasn't asked/answered, usually because a number of questions were added late in the survey.
888 - means a value of greater than zero, but unsure of value. i.e. they harvest a product but don't know how much.
999 - means data entry error. e.g. for land size questions data value reported didn't make sense.

? Coding structure included &amp;quot;sectionname_variablegroup&amp;quot; within the excel output. A supplementary translation of these codes is attached, as well as the original XML code used.

The assessment is designed to capture localised, spatially located wetland condition data suitable for modelling wetland ecosystem services under land use, land management and climate change. The assessment draws upon a number of existing methods and tools, notably the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) (V&amp;aring;gen et al. 2013), Wetland ecosystem service assessment (WET Eco services) (Kotze et al. 2008), National Soil Inventory of Scotland (Lilly et al. 2010), Ugandan National Wetland Inventory system (NWIS)(Henninger and Landsberg 2009) and Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) (Peh et al. 2013). 
The WES assessment survey identifies soil, water and vegetation characteristics in geo-located sampled sites to estimate ecosystem service provision. Collected data is processed for appraising the current provision of wetland services due to wetland management and land uses, particularly C stocks, while establishing a baseline from which to monitor changes in ecosystem properties, functions and services. 
The ALTER WES survey was developed during field trials and implementation in wetland sites in Kabale District, Uganda in 2016. Wetland systems in Kabale are characterised by valley bottom, fluvial fed wetlands under a gradient of wetland land use change, including papyrus wetlands and wetland potato cultivation.
