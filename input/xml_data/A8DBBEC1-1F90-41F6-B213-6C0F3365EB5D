Proponents of membership suggest only limited reforms if the Union is to survive in its current shape, the language of 'There IS No Alternative'. By contrast, proponents of exit imagine a world free of institutional and regulatory constraints, the world of Nirvana. If the former ignores that the Union is subject to continual legal change, the latter does not address the interdependence between the United Kingdom and the European Union that will continue to persist whatever the status of membership. The single market is likely to be at the centre piece of any relationship between the UK and the EU as It is seen as central by those who wish to remain in the Union and interdependence makes it the most likely relationship in the case of exit. Assessments of future relations have, therefore, to be built around this. There are two dimensions here. It is desirable, first, to see how much any single market between the United Kingdom and the Union would be overshadowed by the existing single market within the Union. Secondly, it is necessary to see what can be offered by a single market. To that end, this research compares the three most significant single markets in the world: the European Economic Area in Europe; ASEAN in South East Asia and Mercosur in South America. It looks at the issues most likely to be contentious in the referendum and the ones which will have to be addressed afterwards: the style, scope and intensity of government; how they affect national self-government and democratic participation and they deal with conflicts surrounding citizenship, immigration and social justice. This will allow a more differentiated debate across a wider array of issues about what is possible whilst being a member of the European Union and what would be the best realistic alternatives if exit occurred.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I see my research as being of value to four constituencies.

First, it will benefit British policy-makers in the United Kingdom: be these civil servants, MPs or think tanks. It is the first research which allows institutional alternatives to be compared to the status quo, whether the UK remains within or outside the Union. This will be central to considering renegotiation of EU law if the United Kingdom remains within the Union and important for negotiations in the event of exit in terms of considering alternate relations with the Union. It does this, furthermore, across axes that will be central to any relationship: depth of market integration, intensity of rule, style and scope of government, parliament-executive relations, questions of citizenship, and allocation of scarce public goods. 

Secondly, it will be of benefit to NGOs and the wider public in the run up to the referendum. It provides a series of templates against which any government proposals can be assessed by these rather than, as is the case, assuming that it is otherwise a simple choice between the status quo, an exit with unlimited possibilities and risks. It should both open up issues that maybe should have been renegotiated and illustrate why certain claims were unrealistic.

Thirdly, it will be of interest to Brussels policy-makers. If there is currently an impulse for lighter forms of EU government, it will open up possibilities for reform of EU law by looking at alternate comparable institutional and legal regimes around the world and what they realise. In the event of British exit, questions of mutual commitment and trust will arise as the European Union does not wish a Swiss style arrangement. Brussels policy-makers will therefore be interested in developing alternatives to these which secure economic integration, mutual commitments and the interests of citizens. This research provides that.

Fourthly, I see it as being of interest to policy-makers outside Europe. ASEAN is considering how to move beyond its Economic Community in 2015 and Mercosur and the ANDEAN pact wish to merge into UNISUR. These organisations, as well as the multiplicity of free trade and investment arrangements emerging, have few templates against which to consider their institutional trajectories other than an early vision of the EU, and this is often seen as too distinctive to be helpful. My research will set out a range of possibilities which will allow for more differentiated assessment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139417</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Brookings Institution 'Brexit-in or out?

This was one of the first pieces to propose a transitional arrangement. It was picked up by Newsweek, Chatham House, the Centre for European Reform and British Future.

In the paper done for Open Europe, I and Professor Menon argued for a differentiated immigration policy for Scotland in which, through the use of National Identity cards, Scottish residences could continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship and EU citizens could enjoy equivalent rights in Scotland. This was taken up widely by the Scottish press (The Scotsman, the Herald and the Scottish Sun) under the heading of Scots enjoying a Scottish passport. It has been taken further in the Report of the Scottish Parliaments Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Relations Committee on EU Migration Rights (3rd Report of 2017). They cite my evidence to them at paras 159-162 and indicate their support for a differentiated immigration regime for Scotland.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A7D3CDD6-B944-4C07-8ACE-39C12769AB60</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58bd0b965b8a30.47570130</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I felt my research has moved towards three important findings.

The first went to how individuals experience EU law, and why it is experienced differently from equivalent national laws. In research carried out in 2000, I had discovered that EU law was reported differently from how one would expect it to be. It was reportedly differently from much of the debate on EU politics and it was reportedly differently from how one would expect equivalent national laws to be interpreted. It was, above all, reported in terms of its regulatory cost. This would even be the case on matters such as prohibitions on discrimination against transgendered employees where one would expect other forms of politics to emerge. I returned to this shortly before my award, partly to see if this and partly to explain why. In 'The Persona of EU Law', I explored how the intensity of the responsibilities imposed by EU law contributed to this. I noted that, to secure EU law's authority, a claim had to be made that it could secure better goods for its subjects than national law could. Otherwise why be allowed to act? However, its central resource was its subjects. To do this, it had to get them to do more of what it targeted. This required active and highly capable subjects who are granted significant entitlements but, to thrive, but must also exercise significant responsibilities. A finding was that EU law was subject to a double bind. It imposed intense duties on those it benefitted which these experienced as constraining, and, therefore, alienating. Alongside, it excluded many from its benefits, and this was experienced by the excluded as divisive, and, therefore, alienating.
This did not go the incidence of political contestation of EU law nor whether there was any relationship between contestation about highly salient issues, such as migration, and contestation about more technical aspects of EU regulation, be it lawnmowers or lightbulbs. My hypothesis was that there was such an association as otherwise it was difficult to explain the constant differences in reactions to EU and UK law. Albeit not in my original proposal, it seemed central to explaining what bothered people about government of their lives by the EU and whether these issues will remain after Brexit. The research carried out during the first couple of months of the award looked at this, and has now been published as 'The Unconfined Power of EU Law'. It found that EU law has particular associations because it brings together three things. There is, first, the intensity of EU law mentioned above. Secondly, much of EU law regulates what Eisenstadt has termed 'daily identities'. These are day-to-day activities - such as work, eating, children's school, shopping - which provide not merely stable routines for people's lives but also provide pathways for social integration by bringing people together regularly and central markers for what people associate with a polity when they talk of national ways of life. Thirdly, EU law governs these in an unchecked way in the sense that within the field of its operation, there is nothing to check or sensitivise it to the consequences of this regulation. This leads to a triple dislocation - a sense of the familiar being dislocated by a dehumanising and intrusive (ie anti-social) foreign law.

The next step of my research considers the implications of this in the light of Brexit. A feature of my findings is that regulatory reform, the EU's modus operandi, will have little effect on these dynamics. If regulatory objectives are demanding, they will continue to impose significant responsibilities on individuals and are likely to be concentrated in a few bodies irrespective of the means used. There will also be pressure on the United Kingdom to ensure that EU laws converted into UK law align with EU law either to secure market access or because British laws will be shamed as the most sexist, polluting, consumer unfriendly etc in Europe if they fall below EU standards. A central question will, therefore, be how UK decision-makers engage with these laws. To be sure, British laws will not be framed as foreign laws disrupting daily identities. There is a danger of an ante-politics emerging where it is framed as big government doing these things to local ways of life, and this culminating in a more generalised resistance to administration and institutional politics. I am currently putting the finishing touches to an article on 'Political Community after Brexit' which will be submitted to the Modern Law Review, which argues for a new reconceptualization to deal with this. It will argue for political community to be pluralised to allow such laws to be challenged more easily and to be revisited in a manner which protects and valorises 'daily identities' in a much more vigorous manner than previously.

The second of my research findings went to the types of legitimacy issue surrounding any post Brexit arrangement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was written prior to the referendum, published in Political Quarterly. It was the first to engage with these issues and the only one so far which has looked at other regional models for guidance. It argued, and this is now the position of the British government, that established categories such as Norway, Canada or Turkish options, were too constrained. It argued, furthermore, that legitimacy questions would centre around the content of the norms governing the relationship, on the one hand, and the possibilities for domestic contestation of these on the other. It noted, in this regard, that there were three types of arrangement. The first is extensive agreement with very limited possibility for defection by the UK. This likely to be too rigid. The second is limited agreement with the possibility for ad hoc agreement as issues come up. This is likely to be too reactive and cumbersome, and does insufficient to protect the United Kingdom as the weaker negotiating party. The third is to allow for structured defection from EU law by the United Kingdom in which it commits to follow certain procedures and allows the EU to take countermeasures where there is loss to EU citizens. I argued that this arrangement was likely to be the most adaptive to developments and tensions. The piece then argued that the central cleavages emerging from Brexit between 'insider politics' and disorganised politics, constituted by few organised parties or stakeholder groups, needed also to be addressed. It pushed, therefore, for a system which would allow the latter to pursue citizen initiatives asking for EU laws converted into UK law to be considered.

The third finding, and the one on which I have spent most work, went to the nature and scale of market integration that is emerging in other regional arrangements around the world. The research has involved combining a database of over 1500 measures, each measured across eight parameters, which codes the legal outputs of other arrangements. This has been challenging as with one, ASEAN, these are not assembled anywhere. To date, those on ASEAN and Mercosur are nearly finished. I am editing a special issue in the European Journal of International Law, and the findings are due to be published there in 2018.

The finding emerging from this and research carried out on the European Union is that increasingly these arrangements are not about trade liberalisation or trade integration but about establishing investment clubs, with trade liberalisation simply an instrument for this. In that regard, liberalisation of the current account has become much more significant than trade arrangements to current integration or free trade regimes. This finding is based on evidence which shows that in the 1990s, regional trade regimes, notably MERCOSUR and the EU, focussed on laws which went to what could be traded and who could trade. Mercosur laws have atrophied whilst, in the EU, these laws have been increasingly replaced by standards which govern global rather than just EU markets. In ASEAN and the EU, focus has instead been on laws which go to the conditions of cooperation and competition for industry, infrastructure and to property rights. These are all more central to facilitating investment than trade, and can be more politically sensitive. So why a concern on regional investment laws? The hypothesis follows from that suggested by Gereffi. Value production chains have become shorter around the world and more regionally centred in the last ten years. States realise that they have to align their laws with neighbours to secure investment, and transnational enterprises push for it. If this is right, standard free trade arrangements, such as that of EU-Canada, will be of little help to the United Kingdom. It must look in its post Brexit relations with the EU. for something closer to ASEAN or the Pacific Alliance in Latin America which allows for more wide-ranging administrative engagement across a wide range of activities whilst allowing it the freedom to mediate politically sensitive issues.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My first finding goes to how UK citizens will experience converted EU laws, and their reactions to it after the Great Repeal Bill. I believe that it opens up two avenues of research. The first will be to test responses in the UK to the continued application of much EU law and the disapplication of some. Secondly, thought will have to be given to the procedures which reform this law. To that end, ensuring that these identities are properly mediated within these procedures would, in my view, be an important aim of any research.

My finding that regional integration is increasingly built around investment clubs rather than trade integration could lead to a number of avenues. It opens up questions of institutional design. If these regimes are about attraction of capital into the region and its efficient allocation within it, what are the best procedures to mediate the issues generated by this. Should regulators be more involved than they? What attention is to be paid to the significant distributive issues that might arise from this? How is competition between States in the region to be mediated? Secondly, it goes to the types of laws and measures that will be agreed by such clubs. Do these become increasingly centered around competition, financial, corporate, intellectual property and fiscal issues, as might be the case in a European model, or are other combinations of policies deployed in other political economies of the world? Finally, it goes to the architecture of regulation of the global political economy. Investment clubs do not require exclusivity as the goal is often to attract investment to trade outside the region. This opens the possibility for States of a single investment club to belong to different trading regimes according to the perceived strengths and needs of their economies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B066B034-6981-453C-8038-12571BA35874</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd0681593071.65514827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and
