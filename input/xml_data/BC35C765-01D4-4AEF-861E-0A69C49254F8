A safe and effective RSV vaccine is needed that will not only protect young children, but which will also boost immunity in the elderly.
We have constructed several AdCh/RSV vaccine candidates expressing RSV F, N and M2-1 proteins, which induce complete protection against RSV infection in BALB/c mice and cotton rats, either alone or in a heterologous prime/boost vaccine strategy with MVA/RSV. Importantly, intranasal vaccination did not prime for enhanced pulmonary pathology in either mice or cotton rats, following RSV challenge. However, a transient weight loss was observed in mice. Given the history of RSV vaccine-augmented disease in infants, further studies including ones in a more relevant animal model are required prior to embarking on clinical trials.
The primary objectives of the project are to:
(i) optimise and further evaluate AdCh/RSV vaccine candidates and the AdCh-RSV/MVA-RSV in mice and cotton rats
(ii) evaluate the protective efficacy of the novel AdCh/RSV vaccine in calves, a natural infection model of RSV
(iii) generate pre-GMP material for a rapid implementation of clinical development</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Jenner Newsletter June 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>59F9C3B9-85D1-4920-8973-2311CE057766</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;One Health approach to the development of a vaccine against RSV infection in children&amp;quot; Geraldine Taylor

There is only supportive care for severe cases of infection and a monoclonal antibody against RSV F protein as a very expensive preventive measure for high-risk infants. Worldwide, RSV disease in children under the age of 5 years account for 33.8 million lower respiratory infections, 3.4 million hospitalisations and up to 200,000 deaths annually. RSV exposure elicits an immune response capable of protection from severe disease but not from re-infection. 50% of infants suffer at least one RSV re-infection by their second birthday. Moreover, RSV infection in infancy is associated with subsequent wheeze and asthma in later life. Healthy adults can expect a 7-9% annual risk of infection with mild symptomatic disease and severe immune suppression re-establishes a risk to developing severe disease. Immune system senescence and comorbid conditions place the elderly at risk of severe RSV disease, where hospitalisation burden and mortality are comparable to seasonal influenza. 
The high rate of emergency admissions, lack of universal and cost-effective preventative measures and the magnitude of seasonal disease incidence maintain RSV as a major priority for vaccine development. The demonstration that a novel vaccine based on a chimpanzee adenovirus and modified vaccinia Ankara can protect calves against the closely related bovine RSV infection without enhancement of disease has given confidence to undertake clinical trials in man, which have been funded by Okairos and GSK. Furthermore, the vaccine may also be of value in reducing the economic impact of calf respiratory disease.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4F8509B1-5245-4B87-9192-F4B0FAB2C86E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ce47f33aec2.17989403</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in children and the elderly for which there is still no effective vaccine. The spectre of vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) and the young age of the main target population, have hindered HRSV vaccine development. PanAd3-RSV is a novel simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine candidate expressing a secreted form of the HRSV F protein and the N and M2-1 proteins of HRSV. Previous studies have shown that PanAd3-RSV has protective efficacy against HRSV infection in mice and cotton rats, and is immunogenic in non-human primates. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which protection demonstrated in animal models will translate to humans. We have therefore further evaluated the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the PanAd3-RSV vaccine, and modified vaccinia Ankara expressing the same HRSV antigen (MVA-RSV), against HRSV in cotton rats and against bovine (B)RSV in young sero-negative calves, a model of a natural RSV infection. Here we show that different homologous and heterologous prime/boost vaccine regimens induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protected cotton rats against HRSV infection, and also induced neutralizing antibodies, primed BRSV-specific, IFN?-producing T cells and protected calves against BRSV infection. There was no evidence of enhanced pulmonary pathology in vaccinated cotton rats after HRSV challenge and, importantly, there was no evidence either of enhanced pulmonary pathology or of ERD in vaccinated calves following BRSV challenge. These findings support the continued evaluation of the vectored RSV vaccines in man and show promise as an effective vaccine for calves.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The vaccine has now been used in phase I clinical trials.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8815281B-E3B9-4DC7-AB61-3B990F5833C8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ce364169c64.80478864</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:clinicalTrial>true</gtr:clinicalTrial><gtr:description>Pre-clinical evaluation of an RSV vaccine - studies funded by a DPFS grant from the MRC

RSV is a major cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants, affecting ~64 million children annually, worldwide. In the UK, 2 to 3% of infants &amp;lt;1 year of age are hospitalised each year due to RSV. Children who experience RSV disease early in life run a high risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma. Although nearly all children are infected with RSV by 2 years of age, immunity following natural infection is incomplete and re-infections are common. The economic impact of RSV in adults and burden of disease in the elderly are comparable to or greater than that of seasonal influenza. There is no effective RSV vaccine or anti-viral therapy, apart from antibody prophylaxis for high risk individuals. An effective RSV vaccine is needed that can be deployed in infants to induce protection against lower respiratory tract disease, and which can be used to boost immunity in adults and the elderly.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>mwLm1uc4ruM</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>RSV vaccine</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Vaccines</gtr:type><gtr:ukcrnIsctnId>35082/0003/001-0001</gtr:ukcrnIsctnId><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2014</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:clinicalTrial>true</gtr:clinicalTrial><gtr:description>Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in small animal models of RSV infection and against bovine RSV infection in calves, a natural host of BRSV.
