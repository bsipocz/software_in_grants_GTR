proposed seminars therefore are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to exchange research and evidence on the new forms of regional policy aimed at addressing regional imbalances in the UK (and EU) and China&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to bring these developments to the attention of policymakers in the UK (and EU) and China &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to consolidate an emerging international research network and identify potential for future collaboration. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The key research questions to be addressed in the seminars will be:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of past and existing public policies in relation addressing spatial inequalities in the UK and China?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To what extent can policy innovation in this field be usefully exchanged between the UK (and EU) and China?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How useful are the concepts of ?spatially-blind? versus ?place-based? approaches as a guide to developing public policy interventions in the field of regional development?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What constitutes best practice in local and regional development strategy in the UK (and EU) and China and how transferable are these?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is intended that the findings of this project are fed directly to national, regional and local policy-makers concerned with regional policy. In both the UK (and EU) and in China policymakers are reshaping public policy in this field. Questions of economic geography and the spatial rebalancing of national economies have gained increased political prominence. In each jurisdiction policymakers are developing new understandings of the causes and appropriate responses to geographical inequalities. To date, however, there has been no attempt to exchange knowledge in this field. The proposed partnership is uniquely placed to have maximum impact in this respect. The seminars will involve academic and government researchers who are shaping policy in this field at the highest level. As a government research agency ISPRE is able to disseminate the results of the seminar directly the State Council, while in the UK we will use the networks of the ESRC-sponsored UK Spatial Economics Research Centre to disseminate the findings directly to policy makers in national government departments such as HM Treasury, Department of Business Innovation and Skills and Department of Communities and Local Government. At the European level, the findings will be presented directly to the EU's Mirror Group advising the Platform established by the European Commission's Directorate General for Regional Policy to support regions preparing and implementing Smart Specialisation Strategies. The Directorate General for Regional Policy currently is developing a programme of policy exchanges with BRIC countries on the topic of regional policy and the proposed seminars would contribute to this programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19060</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Spatial Planning and Regional Economy (ISPRE), National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Special Researcher, Institute of Spatial Planning and Regional Economy (ISPRE),</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4292813-9538-40F3-92AC-E50246B4F380</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CURDS Academics appointed as Special Researchers

First, a co-authored paper targeted at the journal Progress in Planning being drafted, with a submission target in early 2014. Second, one of the co-ordinators of the project Dr Xuefeng Wang has been invited to join ISPRE for the application for National Social Science Fund of China on a proposed research project for preparation of the 13th Five-Year Social and Economic Development Plan, which is seen as a master plan for China's development policy published every five years. Third, a paper titled Place-based approaches to regional development: global trends and Chinese implications co-authored by professor John Tomaney and Dr Xuefeng Wang, and a paper titled City-region: a way for China's urbanisation written by Dr Xuefeng Wang were selected as book chapters by Shanghai Jiaotong University for their annual book series of China metropolitan regional development, which itself is funded by China's national project called &amp;quot;985&amp;quot; programme. Fourth, Professor Andy Pike has been appointed as a distinguished guest professor by East China Normal University, Shanghai, and Dr Xuefeng Wang's paper Transferable Lessons from British New Towns Movement to China's Rapid Urban Expansion has been included as part of China's National Key research project for preventing and tackling urban problems during the rapid urbanisation in China, which is funded by the national Ministry of Education of China. Fifth, Professors John Tomaney and Andy Pike and Dr Xuefeng Wang have been invited to be Visiting Professors to ISPRE. Sixth, Professor Andy Pike was invited and funded to give a keynote speech to China's Regional Science Association (RSAC) annual conference in Tianjin, October 2013. The RSAC is based in Peking University and led by a Chinese leading economic geographer, the vice-president of Peking University. RSCA has 3000 members mainly from Chinese higher education institutions and governments' arms-length research organisations and think-tanks. By taking the advantages of the funded trip, Dr Xuefeng Wang was also invited to give several lectures to PG students in Peking University, Nanjing University, China North West University, and Wuhan University. Seventh, RSCA has also proposed to collaborate with CURDS on its newly launched postgraduate programme MA Regional Development and Spatial Planning.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5560B632-6CA1-4F7F-A568-DB3F5B65A63E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463f0331c2831.29001870</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>First, research and evidence has been exchanged on the theme of spatial disparities and policy responses in the UK, EU and China at each of the 6 events described above. Key findings from this cross-national dialogue included: the divergence in approach between policymakers in Britain and China and the different ways in which people and place-based approaches are being handled and integrated; the shifting scales of policy responses to spatial disparity focused upon rebalancing regional development at the sub-national (super-provincial level) regional level, paying no attention to sub-provincial regional disparity, which has led to the significant widening of gaps between regions at this level in China, and changing from regionalism to localism in England in the UK context; and the central importance of governance and institutional arrangements in addressing and underpinning approaches to spatial disparities and policy. Demand for participation in the seminars has been very strong. The feedback from participants at each of the seminar events has been overwhelmingly positive. Key positive points included the importance of seminar series to underpin cross-national research and dialogue around common issues, raising awareness of current conceptual and theoretical approaches to empirical work, and engagement between academics and policymakers.

Second, the academic researchers have engaged and impacted upon policymakers in the UK and China through the seminar events. Policymakers in China have benefitted from increased awareness of new concepts and theories of local and regional development, new approaches to governance and institutional arrangements and the importance of continuity and stability in long-term strategies. Policymakers in the UK have learnt about the importance of long term plans and frameworks for development, balanced and integrated economic and spatial planning, and connecting infrastructure financing and development. 

Third, the emerging international research network on this topic has been further developed and consolidated by the seminar series, facilitating and nurturing the relationships between individuals and institutions in the UK and China. The network developed through the project has also triggered research collaborations. Academic researchers from the UK and China have identified many common interests in spatial disparities and policy responses to be explored in further research grants. Joint applications for research have been developed and some have been successful and funds were secured. CURDS has a Memorandum of Understanding for a joint research centre for research in this area with Shanghai Jiaotong University. In addition, the openness of the seminar series to postgraduate students has stimulated research development and relationships between the UK and China in this area. CURDS has developed and is launching a new MA Regional Development and Spatial Planning in 20114-15 to further this agenda. Partnership Memoranda of Understanding have been signed with several of the partners in the seminar series including Shanghai Jiaotong University.

Fourth, given the cross-national nature of the seminar series and its underpinning international network, some publication outputs have been produced by individuals involved in the network and for further development several collaborative joint publications are planned and in progress.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A series of publications are in preparation arising from materials presented at the university. These include a paper for Urban Studies and a contribution to Progress in Planning. Members of the research network are participants in a NOK 6 million (approx. &amp;pound;700k) proposal to the Norwegian Research Council for a comparative Europe-China study of regional disparities.
