Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/E018939/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Many infectious diseases affect livestock and impact not only on the health and welfare of animals but also on the economic sustainability of our agriculture industry. Among important animal pathogens are some bacteria that live within and are entirely dependent upon host cells. These so-called 'obligate intracellular' bacteria are very difficult to work with hence gaining understanding to aid in improving animal health is very problematic. Since this type of pathogen must infect a host animal to survive they typically develop mechanisms to very efficiently enter and take over host cells and evade the host's defences. Among the obligate intracellular bacteria, Chlamydophila abortus and Lawsonia intracellularis are very highly prevalent in sheep and pigs, respectively. Since such a high proportion of animals are affected, these infections have a considerable effect on animal health, quality of life and productivity. Although vaccines to these pathogens are available these have shortcomings so ultimately, we would like to develop efficient methods to very effectively reduce the effects of these diseases. Since these bacteria are difficult to work with, use of high-technology genomic methods can be very cost-effective and productive ways to improve the understanding of components with important roles in infection and make new developments in controlling disease. Genome sequences provide a wealth of information about pathogens and from this information we have identified a family of components - so-called Type V secretion proteins - which are likely to be involved in causing disease. Analysis of genomes is very informative however this is of greatest value when combined with an understanding of the function of the protein products of genes. We intend to study this family of proteins using computer-based approaches and laboratory methodologies to gain comprehension of these Type V proteins. These proteins are present on the surface of bacteria and, typically, are recognised by host defences and can result in the host activating defences that protect against infection. The ability to vary these proteins can be an important way to 'camouflage' pathogens allowing them to escape from host defences. Both C. abortus and L. intracellularis have many members of these Type V proteins thus we consider it is very likely that the members of this family present on the bacteria surface will vary. By gaining an understanding of how the presence of these proteins varies in each of these species we will be in a position to define the family members that are most important to infection and therefore lead to improved detection, treatment or prevention of these important livestock diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>For many bacterial pathogens, proteins of the Type V secretion system play significant roles in pathogen-host interaction in respect of both pathogenicity and immunity. Members of this protein family are present in a wide diversity of bacteria including the obligate intracellular pathogens Chlamydophila abortus and Lawsonia intracellularis. These species' genomes carry contiguous loci comprising multiple proteins resembling Type V proteins which implies that carriage and/or expression may vary both within and among isolates. To test this hypothesis we will take complementary genomic and functional genomic approaches. Genome sequences for both of these pathogens will be subjected to detailed bioinformatics analyses for motifs representing the main subtypes of these proteins. This will refine the analyses carried out so far and identify any other members of this protein family potentially encoded by these genomes. Comparative genome analysis will be carried out at both intra- and inter-species levels by RFLP, genome hybridisation (microarray) and sequence analysis of the Type V loci from several isolates of these two species. To determine whether isolates vary in expression, candidates will be assessed using RT-PCR, proteomics and immunochemical approaches. To broaden the analysis of Type V protein carriage and expression a seroepidemiological survey of host species (sheep and pigs for C. abortus and L. intracellularis, respectively) will be conducted. This project will define whether Type V proteins of these bacteria impart heterogeneity to strains. This will substantially advance understanding of these important endemic livestock pathogens and make a significant contribution to the development of novel vaccines, diagnostics and epidemiological markers. Furthermore, this will add considerably to the understanding of the important Type V family of bacterial proteins.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1426854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Friedrich Loeffler Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Chlamydial genome sequencing project - collaborating with Friedrich-Loeffler Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC56091E-1D68-481C-89C7-82C038B6C195</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b960e802b960e816-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>To allow genomic comparisons to be made between different C. abortus and C. pecorum strains, DNA has been obtained from isolates from international and local sources.

Archived culture material for five L. intracelularis strains was obtained along with some samples of sera from naturally-infected animals. The strains originating from the USA were received as inactivated cultures and could not be cultured to increase their yields. UK isolate stocks were also replenished and culture has been intermittently successful. The materials obtained have been used for preparation of DNA and protein fractions.



Aliquots of these samples have been analysed and the results bioninformatically analysed to determine the extent of expression of autotransporters and other outer membrane proteins. The analyses have been performed on multiple strains to determine whether there is variation in protein expression between strains. In addition serum samples from control and infected animals have been analysed against the different protein extracts to determine if there is variation in the immunogenicity of proteins between strains.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Veterinary College (RVC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Association of Chlamydia-like organisms with cases of bovine abortion: collaboration with Royal Vetinary College</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0CAD9F1-33DD-4D7C-BBAE-4BED84B7F1AF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95fa15eb95fa172-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>These collaborations, some exisiting, which now include SAC, AHVLA, the University of Zurich, the University of Lausanne and the Royal Veterinary College were started as a result of the initial work on trying to identify C. abortus infected cattle tissue to provide isolates for objectives 4 and 5 of the CEDFAS grant.

Despite the worldwide economic importance and welfare issues associated with infectious bovine abortifacients, as well as potential zoonotic threats posed to human health, diagnosis of the causes of abortion remains poor. This could in part be explained by the presence of unidentified infectious abortifacient agents. Recently several novel species of Chlamydia-like organisms (CLOs) including Parachlamydia acanthamoebae have emerged as putative ruminant abortifacients, as well as involved in cases of respiratory infections and miscarriage in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether such organisms are present in cases of bovine abortion in the UK.

Analysis found that there was greater variability in some pmps compared to others (genotype). No correlation could be made between genotype, host species or geographical origin except for two Greek strains, which formed a discrete genotype in all pmp-encoding regions (5 regions encompassing 18 genes) except one. Findings suggest that although intraspecies heterogeneity of pmp-encoding genes in C. abortus is low, the sequence heterogeneity should be an important consideration when using pmps as the basis for novel diagnostics or vaccine development.

Explorative discussions with an industrial company regarding the identification of potential vaccine candidate antigens through the work conducted on this project, and possible exploitation through future collaborative funding opportunities. However to date this has not evolved in any tangible additional collaborative opportunities, plus the PI involved in this work has now left the organisation so it is unlikely that this will progress in the short to medium term.

Evidence provided in previous work as well as more thorough analysis of the immune response to the chlamydial polymorphic membrane proteins conducted as part of this project has identified one particular protein that is suitable for identifying animals infected with Chlamydia abortus. Additional funding was obtained from Genecom and internal Moredun Innovation Funds to commercially develop and exploit these findings in the form of a new diagnostic ELISA. The work was done in collaboration with Industrial Partner B. Additional Innovate UK funding (&amp;pound;25k) was sought and awarded to take the test through to commercialisation in collaboration with Partner B who would be responsible for marketing the new test and Industrial Partner C who would be responsible for producing the test. The test is now available commercially for purchase.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3A71D80A-4CAE-4C3A-8731-4D718841708E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-2259022176.50695de27e234</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Infectious diseases affect livestock and impact not only on the health and welfare of animals but also on the economic sustainability of the agricultural industry. Among important animal pathogens are some bacteria that live within and are entirely dependent upon host cells. These so-called obligate intracellular bacteria are very difficult to work with, hence gaining understanding to aid in improving animal health is very problematic. Since this type of pathogen must infect a host animal to survive they typically develop mechanisms to very efficiently enter and take over host cells and evade the host's defences. Among the obligate intracellular bacteria, Chlamydophila abortus and Lawsonia intracellularis are very highly prevalent in sheep and pigs, respectively. Since such a high proportion of animals are affected, these infections have a considerable effect on animal health, quality of life and productivity.

Although vaccines to these pathogens are available these have shortcomings so ultimately, we would like to develop efficient methods to very effectively reduce the effects of these diseases. Since these bacteria are difficult to work with, use of high-technology genomic methods can be very cost-effective and productive ways to improve the understanding of components with important roles in infection and make new developments in controlling disease. Genome sequences provide a wealth of information about pathogens and from this information we have identified a family of components - so called Type V secretion proteins or autotransporter proteins - which are likely to be involved in causing disease. Analysis of genomes is very informative, however this is of greatest value when combined with an understanding of the function of the protein products of specific genes. During this project we have studied this family of proteins using computer-based approaches and laboratory methodologies to gain a better understanding of these Type V proteins and the role that they play in causing disease.



Autotransporter proteins are present on the surface of bacteria and, typically, are recognised by host defences and can result in the host activating defences that protect against infection. The ability to vary these proteins can be an important way to &amp;quot;camouflage&amp;quot; pathogens allowing them to escape from host defences. Both C. abortus and L. intracellularis have been found to have many members of these Type V proteins and analysis has shown that these proteins are localised to the organism surface. In addition the patterns of recognition of these proteins by the host immune response was found to vary at different time points during infection, suggesting that the organisms vary the presentation of these proteins on their surface as a means of avoiding host defences, thus making it easier for these pathogens to cause disease. A number of specific proteins from both organisms were identified as being particularly important to infection, either as proteins that can form the basis of new novel diagnostic tests or as candidates for inclusion in vaccine development studies, leading eventually to the improved detection, treatment or prevention of these important livestock diseases.



Key findings:

(i) Genomic sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and comparative genomics of the autotransporter proteins of both have revealed the identification of novel genes encoding putative autotransporter proteins. Findings suggest intraspecies heterogeneity is low, although overall intraspecies heterogeneity is high relative to the whole genome. No correlation was found in terms of host animal species or geographical origin. Heterogeneity is being investigated further in a new deep sequencing genome project, allowing more detailed comparative genomic analysis.

(ii) Identification of heterogeneity in autotransporter expression at both the genomic and proteomic level, suggestive of a role in antigenic diversity and immune evasion, and thus an important role in disease pathogenesis.

(iii) Identification of immunogenic autotransporter proteins through proteomic and immunoproteomic analyses, which are forming the basis for new novel diagnostic tests and as candidates for inclusion in vaccine development studies, leading eventually to the improved detection, treatment or prevention of these important livestock diseases. One test is currently being developed commercially.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Identification of immunogenic autotransporter proteins through proteomic and immunoproteomic analyses, which are forming the basis for new novel diagnostic tests and as candidates for inclusion in vaccine development studies, leading eventually to the improved detection, treatment or prevention of these important livestock diseases.

Knowledge exchange and outreach are important activities for communication and promotion of scientific outputs to a variety of audiences. Communication with non-academic and non-research stakeholders have included a number of articles written for the farming and veterinary press, agricultural shows and liaising with government policy makers and potential industrial partners. These outputs have included 2 articles for the Sheep farmer (received by all members of the National Sheep Association), 2 articles for the Crofter magazine, a Moredun Foundation newsheet (mailed to the 10, 000 Moredun members), and a Moredun magazine article. The work investigating the heterogeneity of UK C. abortus isolates, which identified the abortifacient potential of the currently available EAE vaccine was subject to a press release. This was covered by a number of trade magazines and Newspapers including the Farmer's weekly, Veterinary Times, Press and Journal and The Scotsman, in addition to being carried by the BBSRC and Moredun websites. This work also led to a change in the packaging of the vaccine with its potential as an abortifacient added as an additional contraindication and this additional change was also made to the NOAH website.

A number of publications, providing specific technical advice on the management and control of C. abortus infection in sheep for farmers and veterinary surgeons, as well as potential zoonotic implications for humans for the public in general were written in reviews, articles and book chapters aimed at both scientific and non-scientific audiences. These included chapters on ovine enzootic abortion in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals and on the therapeutics and control of sheep and goat diseases for Veterinary Clinics of North America: Food Animal Practice, both of which provide practical information and advice on the identification, diagnosis and control of the diseases.

In addition a number of presentations and attendances at agricultural events have been made during the course of the project. These include provision of expert advice at the National Sheep Association (NSA) Scotsheep (2010 and 2012), NSA national sheep event (2010), NSA Northern Ireland (2011) and the Royal Highland Show (2010, 2012). In addition presentations have been made to the Sheep Veterinary Society (2010) and during the Moredun Animal Health roadshows (2011). There has also been attendance and interactions with non-research stakeholders, including government, levy boards, industry and farmers, such as at the SAC pig event held at MRI in 2010, the Scottish Beef Cattle Society (2012), Scottish Government Programme stakeholder event days (2010, 2011), at quarterly Moredun Board meetings, at the annual CEDFAS grantholders workshops (2008, 2009, 2010) and at the CEDFAS Final Dissemination Event (2011).

Interactions with government, in addition to personal communications with members of RESAS, have included, Knowledge Scotland website updates on the progress and impact of research connected with this grant, as well as attendance on a Scottish Government work shadowing scheme (2012) to improve communication between scientists, government policy makers and advisers, influencing policy decisions and achieving a greater insight into the processes involved in determining and delivering policy. The Moredun open day in 2008 highlighting aspects of ongoing research was attended by members of the public, farming community, government and industry, as well as veterinarians, school teachers and school children. In addition presentations on the work of the Chlamydia group were made to Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal in both 2010 and 2011 during Royal visits to Moredun. Annual visits to speak to 5th/6th year pupils at an Edinburgh school to encourage and promote careers in science were also undertaken. New bioinformatic software tools for whole genome analysis and genome comparisons were developed in conjunction with the Moredun Bioinformatics Unit (MBU). These tools enabled multiple options for the visual display of the genomes sequenced during the project as well as colour coded displays indicating the level of conservation between genomic segments in multiple genome comparison views. For the proteomic analyses of both pathogens, new software tools were developed in collaboration with the MBU and Moredun Proteomics Facility (MPF) to facilitate the rapid interrogation of data from the mass spectrometer, in order to validate protein hits and thus identify the proteins present in a particular fraction being analysed. These software tools have been invaluable in for the rapid analysis of data sets and have been utilised by many groups within the organisation as well as for data analysis for external clients of the MPF.

Lawsonia intracellularis (Lic) is a fastidious organism, which is extremely difficult to grow and propagate, requiring specialist culture conditions, involving the use of hydrogen to purge tissue culture flasks upon infection of 20-30% confluent mammalian cells, followed by maintenance of flasks in an incubator under 8% oxygen and 8.8% CO2. As part of the work conducted under this project we have somewhat refined and simplified the methodology for growing this organism, following extensive investigations, with the major change being the replacement of the use of hydrogen gas with the addition of cysteine in the infection medium. This has made growth of the organism simpler and safer.

Genomic sequences for two variant strains of C. abortus (Cab) and for three subtypes of C. pecorum (for comparative purposes; as the only major chlamydial pathogen of ruminants yet to be sequenced and published), identified following genomic analysis and comparison of autotransporter (AT) protein genes with wild-type strains during this study, have been fully sequenced and annotated. The much larger genome of Lic type strain N343 has been sequenced for comparison with strain Phe/MN1-00, identifying little difference at the genomic level. All genomes have or will be deposited in public databases upon publication and provide a beneficial scientific resource for downstream comparative genomic and proteomic studies.

As a result of the collaboration with the Sanger Institute on this project, a much larger Cab Genome Sequencing Project was established at no additional cost, involving multi-collaborative international participation, mainly from colleagues in Europe. To date over 67 Cab strains have been isolated, grown and sequenced. The work is ongoing and due for completion early 2013, but will be a significant resource for the scientific community, allowing comparisons at the whole genome level, as well as allowing estimates of genomic heterogeneity, within key protein families (such as type III and type IV proteins) and across strains, which will be important for future control strategies. Based on phylogenetic analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these sequences and cluster analysis, a new typing system has been developed for the genotypic classification of new isolates. As part of all this work new Cab isolates have been generated for genomic, proteomic and sequencing studies. A number of specific antibody reagents have been produced to both Cab and Lic AT proteins that have allowed analysis of the expression of these molecules under different experimental conditions, and comparing relative expression levels both within and across strains. Real time PCR assays have been developed in order to investigate the expression of AT proteins from both organisms at the transcriptional level, while recombinant protein constructs were produced for protein expression and immunological protein expression analysis. All of these reagents and constructs have been made freely available for other research groups to make use of.

While trying to identify new isolates of a bovine origin to fulfil the objectives of this project, new and novel organisms closely related to Chlamydia were identified following partial sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. These sequences (a total of 46), which have been detailed in a number of publications, have been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers GQ919016-GQ919030 and HQ702405-HQ702436. Following on from this, as well as the new collaboration set up between ourselves and the Royal Veterinary College working on the CEDFAS PMWS project, we submitted an application to the BBSRC for a new 3 year project investigating the prevalence and pathogenesis of these organisms.

This application was submitted as an Industrial Partnership with Pfizer, as well as with the dairy sector levy board DairyCo. The application was successful and the project starts in January 2013.

Proteomic analysis of subcellular fractions of C. abortus while investigating the expression of autotransporter proteins in the outer membrane led to the discovery of a novel bacteriophage that infects the organism, this was published and the sequence submitted to GenBank and assigned accession number AY769964. This will provide a potential mechanism for the mutational analysis for studying gene function and hence identifying new and novel targets for future vaccine development studies. 

No licences or patents have arisen so far from the work conducted in this project. However, following the identification of a protein fragment of one of the chlamydial polymorphic membrane proteins as being specific for identifying animals infected with C. abortus and not infected with another chlamydial species that commonly infects ruminants and pigs, C. pecorum, we obtained additional funding to develop this fragment into an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serological detection of anti-C. abortus antibodies. Development of the test into a single well format is expected to be completed early in 2013, at which time it is expected that the test which is being manufactured by a company in Ireland, will be sold by a company based in Edinburgh under a licensing agreement with Moredun.

Proteomic and seroproteomic analysis of L. intracellularis membrane proteins have identified an immunogenic protein, termed LatA, as well as a number of other antigens. LatA has been characterised and suggested to be an autotransporter protein. This offers potential as a serodiagnostic reagent (which currently relies on whole bacterial antigen from culture), although the IP situation is limited by prior art. Nevertheless, the results have led to interest from a veterinary pharmaceutical company into the potential of this work leading to commercially viable diagnostic reagents and subunit vaccine components. This may result in future licensing agreements or patents.

During our investigations of new isolates obtained for this project, a number of isolates that originated from C. abortus vaccinated animals (an attenuated strain) that had aborted as a result of disease caused by this pathogen, revealed the identification of the vaccine in the diseased placentas, suggesting an association with the disease. This was the first report of the live vaccine potentially causing disease and has important implications for the animal health companies that market the two live vaccines. This has led to a collaborative agreement between us and the two animal health companies that manufacture the vaccine to investigate this further.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E4636E1-DF04-49D4-8F1E-FA1103768FBC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8854774012.0950857748ed9e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.moredun.org.uk/research/research-%40-moredun/reproductive-diseases/chlamydia/genome-project</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Completed the draft sequence and annotation of the L. intracellularis strain N343 for comparison with strain Phe/MN1-00.
