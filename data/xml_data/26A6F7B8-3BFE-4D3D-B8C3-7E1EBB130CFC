David Cameron has made this issue one of his main proposals in negotiations over Britain's continued membership of the European Union. 

Today, European societies are affected by decisions adopted by the EU institutions in almost every sphere of economic and political life. Yet, the economic and political crises that have unfolded since 2007-8 have uncovered great problems with how the Eurozone - and the EU more broadly - is governed. The crises have also demonstrated that something is changing in the relationship between citizens, parliaments and their executives. A recurring criticism that has intensified during these past years is that policies agreed in Brussels are too distant from the electorates, as citizens feel they have few possibilities for influencing the political agenda and direction of the Union. Such perceptions have great implications for the legitimacy and efficiency of the EU as well as national political systems, both in the short- and longer run. In the UK, as elsewhere, many voters have demonstrated their apathy by either turning towards political parties at the extremes, or by exiting from political engagement altogether.

The central objective of this project is hence to address how the 'political chain of delegation' is changing in Europe; from citizens to national parliaments and governments, to policies adopted by nationally elected representatives in the EU institutions. With a particular focus on the UK, it seeks to address how citizens and national parliaments can hold their governments and representatives to account, and how a number of accountability measures affect political processes and public perceptions. 

The activities carried out during the Fellowship will come at a crucial time for the UK and for the EU more broadly. The Prime Minister has promised an 'In/Out' referendum on Britain's continued membership of the Union at a time when existential dilemmas regarding governance of the EU and Eurozone area must be addressed. Steps must also be taken to solve the geopolitical and humanitarian challenges in South- and South-Eastern Europe. The Fellowship will hence see it as its primary task to bridge academic analyses and evidence with the political reality that EU and UK decision-makers will be met with in the run-up to a British referendum and beyond. 

The Fellowship will result in a number of concrete outputs including a series of publications, public events and roundtables with politicians, officials and senior experts in the field. The Fellowship will in its analyses draw on a number of existing studies, including the applicant's own research and previous publications. Based on these insights, the candidate will be able to act as an academic expert adviser to policy practitioners in the UK and Brussels at a time where negotiations between the UK government and its European partners will enter into a crucial phase ahead of the UK referendum. Importantly, the Fellowship will also seek to inform and contribute to the public debate through public events, opinion pieces and analyses in the popular media. UK voters must be informed about the consequences for their democracy when they cast their vote in the EU referendum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Three sets of beneficiaries can be identified from the Fellowship's activities: the global academic community; policy practitioners in London and Brussels; journalists and UK voters in the run-up and aftermath to the forthcoming EU referendum. As the contributions to the academic community have been discussed above, this section summarises the impact and benefit to policy practitioners and to journalists and the wider public. 

Policy-makers
Practitioners in London and Brussels will benefit from the Fellowship's activities in a number of ways. First, the applicant is regularly invited to private meetings, roundtables and events with key policy-makers and officials to discuss the UK's negotiation points regarding its continued membership of the EU. This includes meetings in the UK Cabinet Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Treasury, and committees in the House of Commons and House of Lords. The applicant is also in frequent contact with Members of the European Parliament and senior officials in the EU institutions. As an ESRC Senior Fellow the applicant will be able to act as an independent expert adviser who can provide timely and critical insights into the role of national parliaments in EU affairs, both under current political and legal structures and with recommendations for future scenarios.

Journalists and voters in the UK
The Fellowship will be of direct benefit to the UK voters and to journalists covering the UK referendum. The public debate leading up to the referendum will need short analyses and informed opinion pieces digestible for the wider public. The fellowship's articles and blog posts will hence be disseminated through mainstream media and newspapers, social media and the Initiative's blog, while the applicant will also be available for interviews and input to journalists in the UK and abroad.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73753</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N015428/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
