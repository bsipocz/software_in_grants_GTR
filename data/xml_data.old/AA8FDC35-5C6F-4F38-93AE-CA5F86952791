Combining interview footage with scenes from Uganda and the four people's everyday lives, the film captures their enthusiasm for a new chance at life and their hope for the future. Their stories portray vividly how HIV has become a manageable chronic condition, not a death sentence, and illustrate the changes taking place for many other people living with HIV in Africa and elsewhere. The words of one of the participants inspired the name of the documentary: &amp;quot;I can now plant a mango tree and live to eat its fruits&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D98B8F61-0F82-47B4-8878-DDD1E0E36D61</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The documentary film (English and Luganda versions) was made with the approval and input of the The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO) in Uganda, and is being shown in Kampala and Entebbe to inspire and encourage people attending their clinics to start and continue taking treatment. Its main target audiences for impact are therefore citizens in Uganda (and other countries - see below) and civil society organisations like TASO. The film has had over 1500 views on YouTube (http://youtu.be/9zFaKNPL2OQ).

Before the first showing of the film on World AIDS Day 2013 (1st December) in Norwich, the PI did two radio interviews with Radio Norfolk. After showing the film at the Picture House Cinema in Norwich (Cinema City) we were contacted by a representative of an organisation called the Pan African Development Education and Advocacy Progamme (PADEAP) (http://www.padeap.net). PADEAP requested film copies for its projects in Uganda and Nigeria. We have also made a French version of the film to be used in parts of Francophone Africa by PADEAP.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54623eddeb90b5.05361315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Mango Tree: Living with HIV in Uganda</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zFaKNPL2OQ</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO), Uganda</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3509EA26-D913-495D-ACB7-057491116559</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visit to TASO headquarters in Kampala to discuss the research findings from this grant, as well as potential new research ideas relevant to TASO.

The first set of findings to be published in PLOS One (Martin et al 2014) showed that quality of life (QoL) among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Uganda (n=260) was higher than among a community control sample (n=160). The data also showed that depression scores were lower among the PLWH compared to the community control sample. These are surprising and original results. 

A related paper, published in PLOS ONE (Russell et al 2016), presents qualitative data and theoretical insights from health psychology literature to explore why PLWH reported higher QoL scores and lower depression scores. Among the 38 participants involved in the qualitative research, many were struggling economically, however the recovery of health and hope on ART had enhanced wellbeing and motivated self-management. The majority were managing their condition well across three broad domains of self-management. First, they had mobilised resources, notably through good relationships with health workers. Advice and counselling had helped them to reconceptualise their condition and situation more positively and see hope for the future. Many had also developed a new network of support through contacts they had developed at the ART clinic. Second, they had acquired knowledge and skills to manage their health, a useful framework to manage their condition and to live their life. Third, participants were psychologically adjusting to their condition and their new 'self': they saw HIV as a normal disease, were coping with stigma and had regained self-esteem, and were finding meaning in life. Our study demonstrates the centrality of social relationships and other non-medical aspects of wellbeing for self-management which ART programmes might explore further and encourage.

Another key set of findings was about changing patterns of stigmatisation caused by people's recovery of health on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Processes of reduced self-stigmatisation were clearly evident among the 38 participants, caused by recovery of physical appearance and support from health workers. However most participants continued to conceal their status because they anticipated stigma, for example they feared gossip, rejection and their status being used against them. Anticipated stigma was gendered: women expressed greater fear of enacted forms of stigma such as rejection by their partner; in contrast men's fears focused on gossip, loss of dignity and self-stigmatisation. The evidence indicates ART has not reduced underlying structural drivers of stigmatisation, notably gender identities and inequalities, and that interventions are still required to mitigate and tackle stigmatisation, such as counselling, peer-led education and support groups which can help PLWH reconstruct alternative and more positive identities. 

Another set of findings examine how people living with HIV (PLWH) were able to reconceptualise their understanding of HIV and enhance their capacity to self-manage the condition (Russell et al 2015). The participants' narratives revealed how ART providers played an important role in shaping participants' HIV self-management processes. Health workers helped PLWH realise that they could control their condition, provided useful concepts and language for emotional coping, and gave advice about practical self-management tasks, although this could not always be put into practice. ART providers in this setting were spaces for the development of a collective identity and a particular form of therapeutic citizenship which encouraged self-management, including adherence to ART. Positive framing institutions are important for many PLWH in resource-limited settings and the success of ART programs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>HIV treatment providers in resource-limited settings can use the findings to inform aspects of their their provision, notably in relation to self-management and stigma reduction programmes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C04DE3B-00EC-4A18-9788-C84313D88092</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6298127087.110772b2f29dd0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>85BEC531-6B30-40E4-AE3C-E9BE59853CD3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adjustment as process and outcome: Measuring adjustment to HIV in Uganda.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of health psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6749b7fb8b90ae10766864fe00a3159f"><gtr:id>6749b7fb8b90ae10766864fe00a3159f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-1053</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54525bb3ea2559.54059847</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>58AC1CB5-DEB2-443A-8D30-CB68F146D38C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The framing and fashioning of therapeutic citizenship among people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy in Uganda</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1"><gtr:id>3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Russell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>ISSN 1756-7904</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54623cd55feb95.81406415</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F6C48D2-3290-47A5-AF89-6555E5D8B644</gtr:id><gtr:title>Finding Meaning: HIV Self-Management and Wellbeing among People Taking Antiretroviral Therapy in Uganda.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1"><gtr:id>3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Russell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56cb6378ecc7d5.28751279</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E517CC4E-D896-41C1-A655-D01113407C08</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Framing and Fashioning of Therapeutic Citizenship Among People Living With HIV Taking Antiretroviral Therapy in Uganda.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Qualitative health research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1"><gtr:id>3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Russell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1049-7323</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56cb6378c14626.03343027</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>10CF7CE3-5D16-4F41-BFCB-ECAA8BEF61BF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Finding Meaning: wellbing among people living with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy in Uganda</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1"><gtr:id>3048ea04500d726f4818dc9dfcfccef1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Russell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>ISSN 1756-7904</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54623c1fb544e3.75308206</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B9ABEC50-7202-40E4-A6B4-A3627743A007</gtr:id><gtr:title>The WHOQOL BREF questionnaire in Luganda: Validation with a sample including people living with HIV in Uganda</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>School of International Development Working Paper Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6749b7fb8b90ae10766864fe00a3159f"><gtr:id>6749b7fb8b90ae10766864fe00a3159f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54525cbe819b79.19525539</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3B68AA80-99CB-4436-963A-4E1ACFC9FE1D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Antiretroviral therapy and changing patterns of HIV stigmatisation in Entebbe, Uganda.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociology of health &amp;
