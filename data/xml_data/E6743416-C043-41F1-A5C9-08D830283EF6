It has been estimated that flood damage could account for &amp;pound;10bn to the UK economy in 25 years and that risks relating to precipitation, over the next 30-100 years, will increase by 2-4 times across the UK (Foresight, 2004). Repeated high profile flooding events have resulted in heightened public and policy perceptions of this risk. However, the counterpart of flooding, drought, has received much less attention. This is despite the fact that 2003 saw a Europe wide drought with associated costs of Euro8.7bn (Commission of the EC, 2007). Whilst at first glance, it appears counter-intuitive that the hazard of too much water might co-exist with the threat of too little water, this is an emerging phenomenon in the UK. The 2007 floods were preceded by two years of heat waves and droughts (Pitt, 2008) and in 2009-10, the UK faced rainfall levels lower than the long term average and accompanying drought in some areas (Commission of the EC, 2011). Just as global warming is leading to milder, wetter winters, so too, increases in global temperatures are also likely to lead to greater levels of evaporation from the land surface resulting in drought in some areas as well as subsidence. Whilst trends in climate change are discernible, forecasting is more problematic; both flooding and drought are characterised by high levels of uncertainty, unpredictability and emergence. Consequently, novel responses that are multi-dimensional, involving relevant stakeholders and spanning regulative, cultural-cognitive and normative domains are required for effective mitigation strategies. This research project adopts an integrative approach to understanding climate change perturbations to the water environment. This is achieved through viewing water management as a continuum from over-supply to under-supply, rather than focussing upon overt manifestations of water supply extremes i.e flood and drought. By adopting this lens, commonalities which extend across different forms of water related risk can be identified, as can barriers to effective management and mitigation. Through the collection and analysis of primary and secondary data using both traditional and novel research strategies, an evidence based framework will be developed to assist decision making across institutions and behaviours across stakeholder groups. This framework shall be informed by an initial literature review drawing upon academic literature across a range of disciplines, including: risk perception and communication; natural sciences and engineering perspectives on water flows and catchment; political and legal perspectives on governance and regulation, risk management and strategic perspectives on resource utilisation, capabilities and decision making and national/international best practice. Rich data gathered from in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders shall add a qualitative dimension to the research strategy. Live data on flood/drought captured from social media for a case study in the Yorkshire region shall make a novel contribution to the proposed framework by allowing the incorporation of inferences derived from real time data on stakeholder perceptions, communications and behaviours to varying levels of flood and drought risk. In effect, the framework shall translate the academic, policy and practice findings into a tool which can be utilised to enhance stakeholder behaviour and decision making. This integrated framework can then be tested through two validation workshops where stakeholders will be invited participants thereby ensuring the robustness of this research output. During the later stages of the research project, opportunities for further trialling of the framework as well as potential sources and partners for funding the further development of this integrated approach will be explored by the researcher and the research partners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77017</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Yorkshire Agricultural Society (YAS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration in knowledge exchange and research</gtr:description><gtr:id>29F4F599-BF37-4CB5-BEE2-FD222035B56A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Regional 'Water Summit', held on 11 February 2014 at FERA, Sand Hutton, Yorks.

At the same time there is uncertainty about what this means in terms of impacts. These attributes create challenges for different stakeholders' sense making processes which are the underpinnings for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Moreover, floods and droughts are socially constructed over time and need to be understood in the context of societal change. Key findings from the fellowship include:

1. Flood and drought share common ground in terms of complexity of cause and effect. Flood can arise from different sources (coastal, pluvial, fluvial and surface water) whilst drought can manifest in different forms (meterological, hydrological, socio-economic, agricultural and ground water). This creates challenges in terms of appropriate management strategies spanning diverse stakeholder groups with potential conflicting needs. However, they also differ significantly. A flood is typically a sudden onset crisis whilst drought is a creeping crisis. This typology reflects difference across dimensions of scale, scope and time. Floods can be extremely localised events with a very brief time span impacting upon a relatively small number of stakeholders; droughts manifest at a larger spatial scale, lasting longer and impacting more broadly. This dimensional variation creates challenges for moving beyond coping responses towards effective longer-term adaptation strategies.
2. In the UK, the experience of flood and drought is highly variable with communities having no, some, or much experience these hazards. Many stakeholders (with the exception of agriculture) have experience of either flooding or drought, but not both. Extensive flooding in recent years, which has been widely reported in the media, also creates an issue in risk perceptions around drought, in effect a cognitive dissonance arises between risk perception of flood and drought risk. For example, those who have suffered flooding find it hard to contemplate how drought could be a potential risk given the surfeit of water they have experienced, and seen reported in the media. 
3. Flood and drought need to be more situated within a more holistic approach to understanding and managing the water cycle. At present, focus largely falls upon the management of these water cycle extremes. This creates silos of activities around these phenomena which are biased towards reaction rather than proaction; coping rather than adaptation. These silos can be seen in different institutional practices, for example, governmental and regulatory management, research and resilience capacity building. A systemic approach is required which enables problem construction around flood and drought to be viewed within a socio-technical framework of UK water management across different levels. This would also facilitate recognition that these hazards are not value neutral, they are highly political in perceived cause, effect and potential resolution. A socio-technical framework underpinned by a catchment and ecosystems structure provides the opportunity to engage with local stakeholders in a way that they find meaningful and which may also offer benefits in terms of more effective communication around water behaviours which impact upon stakeholder vulnerability to flood and drought events.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is already happening. The work carried out through the fellowship has directly fed into new streams of research and collaborations, some of which have been supported through RCUK funding (McGuinness as Co-Investigator). These include: (i) continuing work on drought risk and the water continuum, focussing upon business and agricultural business perceptions and behaviours with respect to water scarcity in the NERC funded 'DRY' project with the aim of producisng a decision-making utility (2015-19); (ii) studying and developing suitable mobilisation initiatives to engage people/stakeholders in taking action so that collective water services can be delivered more efficiently and/or with reduced environmental impact in the EPSRC funded TWENTY 65 project (2015-20) and; (iii) aiming to co-produce new conceptual framings around Civil Society's relationships with the Extreme Weather Adaptation Cycle through a multi-stakeholder exploration of impacts of innovations on social learning and increased capital for resilience in an ESRC seminar series, 'Increasing Civil Society's capacity to deal with changing extreme weather risk'(2016-19); and (iv) through developing collaborative work with South Yorkshire Local Resilience Forum on an innovative model for building community resilience to flooding from the bottom up.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C44249A-3FA5-4E19-BFB9-4918E9A552E2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e00cf4aeafc1.46576588</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE73FE38-CA3B-4407-9401-EECB22D4AAB7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of flooding upon Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/734fb79e29bbc81be451d53871d78a09"><gtr:id>734fb79e29bbc81be451d53871d78a09</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGuinness, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>n/a</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54533b50a18cb3.43265230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8539A5CB-B5B5-478D-A43D-4DA9FFE2EBFE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting: Exploring communications on water scarcity in large corporate organisations</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d435ca052761efdf82c997722a098039"><gtr:id>d435ca052761efdf82c997722a098039</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morris, J.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b2962baff5.08251651</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1656886E-853D-4C27-9584-2769FFD96A81</gtr:id><gtr:title>Drought and water management reporting of global corporations: an exploratory study</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d435ca052761efdf82c997722a098039"><gtr:id>d435ca052761efdf82c997722a098039</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morris, J.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b220eabe55.00437658</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>10B41C77-F08F-433D-A261-9D669CE5AC41</gtr:id><gtr:title>Planning for floods and droughts in the face of climate change - a continuum perspective</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/734fb79e29bbc81be451d53871d78a09"><gtr:id>734fb79e29bbc81be451d53871d78a09</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGuinness, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545fa7dddde9c9.44924463</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FAE6E22F-F4FA-4032-BA30-7EC16AF49F6F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring multi-level capacity building for flood resilience</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Workshop 'Resilience: Just Do IT?!
