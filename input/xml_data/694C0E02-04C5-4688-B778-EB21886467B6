It will collaborate with young people, youth workers, managers, funders and policy makers/influencers, to understand the effects of impact measurement, and develop approaches to evaluation that are congruent with youth work practice.

Youth work can be life-changing for marginalised young people, developing social and cultural opportunities and contributing to wider community benefits. It takes place in youth clubs, community buildings and on the streets, and is open to all, or aimed at groups with shared experiences of oppression (e.g. young women, LGBT young people, young refugees). It is rooted in the 'voluntary principle' (i.e. that it is young people's choice to take part), enabling a more equal power dynamic than that in schools and formal social services. 

In recent years, spending reductions have led to the closure of many local government youth services and charitable projects. In this context, a 2011 House of Commons Education Select Committee inquiry asked youth organisations in England to demonstrate the value of their work by developing clearer outcomes measures. In response, a new youth impact agenda has emerged, instigated by government and influential third sector organisations, to promote the measurement of impact in youth settings. 

While the youth impact agenda has been welcomed by many youth sector bodies, some practitioner organisations have argued that measuring predefined outcomes is inconsistent with youth work. Impact is associated with the quantitative measurement of planned outcomes, such as through 'pre and post' tests or randomised control trials. However, personal and social development are notoriously difficult to measure, and impact tools themselves can be inappropriate in youth work settings: for example, questionnaires asking young people about their attitudes or behaviour can be intrusive, particularly early on in a young person's engagement. Impact measurement is particularly challenging in community-based open youth work settings, where outcomes emerge gradually over time rather than being pre-defined.

The youth impact agenda has quickly become influential, yet we know little about how it has been implemented in open youth work settings, or what effects it has had on practice. This is important: if funding is tied to quantitative measures of impact, then it will be difficult for open youth work to demonstrate its value according to those measures, and a valuable tradition of practice built up over more than a century might be lost. Even less is known about how young people experience and perceive impact mechanisms; young people are not a homogeneous group, and it could be that some groups of young people gain satisfaction from reflecting on their outcomes, while others might find impact-related questioning intrusive and off-putting.

This three-year research project will involve 146 participants in qualitative interviews, focus groups, participant observations and youth participatory methods (photography, peer interviewing and film-making). It will find out how the youth impact agenda is implemented in practice, and how impact processes are experienced and perceived by young people and youth workers. It will include the perspectives of funding agencies and policy makers, and explore how and why 'youth impact' has become so important at this time. Research findings will be shared in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and a symposium to discuss policy and impact in the wider social sector. Findings will be disseminated widely through a short film (made and disseminated by young people); a series of deliberative discussions involving practitioners, managers, funders and policy makers/influencers; policy and practice briefings; and a practitioner conference to share approaches to evaluation and accountability that are congruent with open youth work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Young people, particularly those who participate in youth work. Youth work is usually open to all young people of around 11-19 years in age, and is often attractive to and aimed at groups who are marginalised or disadvantaged by mainstream services.
1a) During the project: 60 young people will take part in interviews and/or focus groups, enabling them to reflect on their journeys through youth work and their experiences of youth work monitoring, measurement and evaluation. 20 young people will be involved in participatory youth research, including peer interviewing and photo-voice methods. 10 will plan, make and evaluate a film, drawing on the research findings, which they will use as the basis of workshops in other youth clubs. An additional 45 (3 groups of 15) will take part in these workshops, discussing and debating youth work's value and how it is / should be evaluated. Over 100 young people will view the film on social media. 2 young adults (recent youth work participants) will be on the Advisory Group. 
1b) After the project: it is hoped that thousands of young people taking part in youth services in the UK and internationally will benefit through the project's contribution to better evidenced services, more congruent evaluation and accountability mechanisms, and more youth-centred evaluation in youth work.

2) Youth workers, managers, youth organisations (local authority, voluntary sector, social enterprises).
2a) During the project: 12 youth organisations (8 UK, 4 USA) will participate directly in the research. 42 youth workers, 12 managers and 12 administrators will take part in interviews / focus groups, providing an opportunity to reflect on the value and impact of youth work and its evaluation. Two in-depth case study organisations and their employees will benefit additionally from more in-depth discussions on evaluation, and from collaborating with the research team on youth participatory research. 70 practitioners and managers will benefit through involvement in round-table workshops and the practitioner conference. 3 experienced youth workers will be on the Advisory Group. Over 200 practitioners and managers from the voluntary sector, public sector and social enterprises will view the young people's film, and read accessible practice briefings, blog posts, short articles, and open access academic publications. 
2b) After the project: it is hoped that hundreds of youth workers, managers and organisations will have more awareness of, and confidence to use, youth-centred and practice-oriented approaches to evaluation, and that they will benefit from more awareness amongst funders and policy makers of youth-centred evaluation methods.

3) Policy makers / influencers, funding agencies, third sector organisations in the areas of youth work, youth impact or charitable / public service impact. These groups overlap in the youth sector, where key charities and social enterprises are particularly influential on policy and practice.
3a) During the project: 4 representatives of influential third sector organisations, 2 with significant policy influence, will be on the advisory group. 12 policy makers / advisors (UK) and 8 experts / informants (USA) will be interviewed, providing opportunities for reflection on the policy process around youth impact, and how youth impact is perceived and experienced in youth work settings. 12 funder representatives and 12 policy makers / influencers will take part in round-table discussions to develop alternative approaches to impact. 3 from each group will be brought together with practitioners and managers for a final round-table to discuss ways forward. The research team will publish and disseminate short policy briefings, and will be prepared to contribute to existing and unanticipated policy processes.
3b) After the project: It is hoped that these groups will be more informed on using practice-oriented, youth-centred approaches to accountability and evaluation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R004773/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D8C04024-FB47-49BA-9905-98DD5083D92E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Children and Families</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
