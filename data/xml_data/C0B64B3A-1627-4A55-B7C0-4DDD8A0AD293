and/or trans relationships and their implications for theory and practice.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J012580/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Building on the growing literature about same-sex and trans domestic violence, this project uses mixed methods to collect data from people who have behaved abusively in same-sex and/or trans relationships and practitioners who work with (heterosexual) domestic violence perpetrators.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Firstly, a survey will be conducted to investigate relationship expectations, attitudes towards using abusive tactics and abusive behaviour in previous same-sex and/or trans relationships (n=200). Next, qualitative interviews will explore the understandings, values and support needs of people who have behaved abusively in previous same-sex and/or trans relationships (n=40).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Findings from these methods will be used to develop interviews and discussion in the second phase with practitioners. In-depth interviews with practitioners (n=15) will explore understandings of same-sex and trans domestic violence and reflections on the dis/continuities with their experiences of working with heterosexual male perpetrators; and six focus groups with practitioners will elicit their views on how the findings could inform the development of suitable interventions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Additionally, this research will:&lt;/p>

 &lt;li>contribute a knowledge base about abusive partners in same-sex and trans relationships&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>recommendations for relevant practitioners&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the development of a methodology for the complex and sensitive task of researching perpetrators of domestic violence in same-sex and trans relationships.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a timely piece of research as the Violence Against Women and Girls Action Plan (2011) has identified prevention, rehabilitation and holding those who are violent/abusive accountable as key aims to be achieved over the next five years; and acknowledges that work needs to be targeted at victim/survivors and those who are abusive/violent across gender and sexuality. Making perpetrators accountable for their behaviour has proved challenging: attrition rates are amongst the highest of all crimes (Hester, 2006); and evidence of efficacy of voluntary perpetrator programmes is mixed. However, it is believed that these programmes offer real alternatives to criminalising partners who are also often parents. The challenge is to design the programmes to be appropriate for those attending them yet very little is known about those who are abusive in same sex and/or trans relationships or what might work for them in the design of interventions for them. This project intends to contribute to these debates at two levels: both theoretically in terms of how the disconnect between the heteronormative model of domestic violence might be addressed and amended to be more inclusive of diverse relationships; and in practice in terms of how interventions might be designed to more reflect the specificities of those who are abusive in same sex and/or trans relationships. 

Through inclusion of practitioners in the research and of key agencies such as Respect and Broken Rainbow on the steering group it is intended that the findings will be discussed and disseminated in such a way as to have direct impact on the domestic violence field and in the provision of interventions for abusive partners (as well as support for victim/survivors and their children). 

The dissemination strategy is informed by the goal of maximising impact: two free dissemination events at the end of the Project with an invited audience (including those identified by the steering group); a research report with key findings and recommendations for practice published online and distributed at the dissemination events and through networks identified by the steering group (e.g. on the website of Respect; Broken Rainbow; Stop Domestic Abuse on the LGBT Youth Scotland website); publications in 3 practitioner journals (for e.g. British Journal of Social Work; Probation Journal; Howard Journal of Criminal Justice) and 3 academic journals (Violence Against Women; Sexualities;Journal of Homosexuality); papers presented at 1 national conference (British Criminological Society Conference) and 2 international conferences (European Sociological Association, Violence Against Women, Canada). It is also intended that a book will be written in a style that is accessible and engaging for both academic and practice audiences.

It is also intended that the findings will inform the broader field of relationships and intimacy for academic and practitioner (e.g. counselling) audiences. The findings will be of interest to both of these audiences in terms of what those entering same sex and/or trans relationships expect from these relationships; how and in what ways these relationships are gendered; whether and from whom those in these relationships seek help about their abusive behaviours; what kinds of help those who have been abusive might want and/or use. It is intended that there will also be a report written that addresses this agenda which will be circulated to agencies such as Relate (who will also be invited to the dissemination events).

Finally it is intended that the findings will also be written up for LGBT audiences in key mediums, such as Diva and Gay Times the two biggest selling magazines within the UK for LGB readerships; and through newsletters and other appropriate publications aimed at trans communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267483</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Voluntary Action Fund</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Dissemination Event for Coral Project in Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:id>016E337E-A406-424E-BA7A-C67075EA004B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The partnership is on-going with these organisations providing routes into the Scottish Domestic Violence and Abuse sector; and promoting research to LGBT communities.

It is still early days to report on impact, particularly in the current funding climate. As part of the dissemination strategy the Coral Project held dissemination events in London, Sunderland, Edinburgh and Cardiff. Of the 163 attendees at the Sunderland dissemination event and the 73 attendees at the London dissemination event, 146 completed evaluation forms (62%). Participants came from a range of agencies, including senior managers and frontline practitioners from within mandatory and voluntary perpetrator programmes, the Crown Prosecution Service, youth projects including sexual health projects, LGBT organisations (e.g. Galop, MESMAC), domestic violence and abuse specialists (e.g. IDVAs, MARAC coordinators), sexual violence specialists (e.g. Rape Crisis, ISVAS), counsellors and therapists working privately and from within third sector counselling services (including from within the NHS). Of these, 99% said the Coral Project findings would be useful for their work (13% 'extremely useful', 59% 'very useful' and 27% 'quite useful'). Asking participants in what ways the report and findings would be useful, 32% said for developing practice; 24% for developing training; 8% for securing funding; and 36% for increasing knowledge/awareness about the field. 
In order to further support these impacts we suggested providing Briefing Papers aimed at different practitioner groups. In the evaluation of the two events we asked participants to indicate which Briefing Papers they would wish to receive from the list of: voluntary perpetrator interventions; mandatory perpetrator interventions; youth work; sex and relationships work; specialist domestic violence sector; counselling and therapy; LGBT sector. Participants showed interest in the full range suggesting not only that we were able to include a range of practitioners in the dissemination events but also that there is significant interest in finding out more about how the findings can be applied in practice.

We have circulated draft briefing papers to practitioners within Probation and counselling/therapy services, both third sector and NHS to get feedback on their usefulness for wider dissemination. 

However, we are currently involved in the following activities or are aware of the following developments arising from the Coral Project: 
i. Raising awareness of the needs of those who are abusive in LGB and/or T relationships: We have spoken at five events where practitioners and academics have been invited in London, Worcester, Chester and at both dissemination events of the Mirabel Project in London and Durham in January 2015) (numbers overall = 450). 

ii. We have published a summary of findings in SAFE, the Women's Aid Magazine aimed at practitioners. 

iii. Working with practitioners to improve their practice: 
a. We are currently working with probation projects in four probation services (in London, the South East, and at NOMS national office) and four counsellors/therapists in the North East to develop our briefing papers aimed at these groups and in giving advice on the development of perpetrator interventions and relationship interventions more generally for LGB and/or T abusive partners. Our findings suggest that there can be confusion amongst individuals about their being a perpetrator/victim when they use retaliatory or defensive violence/abuse and this has had some impact on practitioners who are considering piloting more general 'relationships' work with LGB and/or T communities. 
b. Dr Barnes has been invited to give input into the development of an LGBT version of an existing domestic violence and abuse awareness programme (the DAY programme, designed and coordinated by Natalie Collins) that practitioners are trained to deliver to young people. This development work is scheduled for December 2015 and will make use of the Coral Project findings, particularly with regard to helping practitioners to differentiate victims and perpetrators, understand identity abuse and tackle the invisibility of LGBT domestic violence and abuse that is a product of the 'public story' of domestic violence and abuse. 
c. In addition, Prof Donovan is working with a colleague at Sheffield Hallam to promote an informal sex and relationships education agenda for LGB and/or T young people and recently she co-facilitated an ESRC funded Social Science Festival national panel on this. Out of this is expected to develop a national network of interested practitioners currently providing information SRE for young LGB and/or T people that will draw on findings from the Coral Project to inform best practice that includes attention to behaviours in relationships that might be violent/abusive. 

iv. We are aware of the findings being used by the following organisations: 
a. Coral Project findings have been cited in a report written by Citizens Advice Bureau calling for experienced social and legal support for victims of domestic abuse, with particular recognition of marginalised groups such as LGBT individuals (Parker, I. (2015) Victims of Domestic Abuse: Struggling for Support?). Evidence from the Coral Project has also been cited in the Kirklees Domestic Abuse Strategy (Kirklees Council (2015) Kirklees Domestic Abuse Strategy 2015-2018: Taking Up the Challenge Towards Freedom). The Coral Project end-of-project report has also been included as a signpost for police in the College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice Resources on domestic abuse risk and vulnerability. 

The following findings from our work have resonated with practitioners in the field:
b. The apparent confusion amongst LGB and/or T people themselves as well as practitioners about identifying perpetration and /or other uses of violence/abuse: This has led some practitioners to consider developing interventions that are more generally targeted at 'relationships work' rather than specifically at 'perpetration'. Broken Rainbow, LGBT Youth Scotland and Equation in Nottingham have all indicated that the findings have informed their work in thinking about and responding to domestic violence and abuse where at least one partner identifies as LGB and/or T. Equation intends to hold a conference in early 2016 to which we will be invited to present our findings to a practitioner audience. 
c. The lack of interventions of any kind for LGB and/or T people concerned about their own relationship behaviours: This has prompted three agencies to consider the development of programmes (one is a probation service and the other are Respect in partnership with Broken Rainbow) and to apply for funding. 
d. The different ways in which power might be exerted within LGB and/or T relationships. This has led to specific case studies from the Coral Project to be used in training by the Dyn Project in Safer Wales to increase awareness. Equation in Nottingham is also planning to develop training on violence and abuse in self-defence and resistance and the Coral Project data may be used as part of the training materials. 
e. The need for counsellors/therapists to have the opportunity for training, both in:
i. Knowledge about the relationships LGB and/or T people might have and the similarities and differences that might occur as compared with their heterosexual counterparts; and 
ii. Knowledge about domestic violence and abuse and how dynamics of power and relationship rules might impact on how partners in the relationship might understand and make sense of their experiences in relationships where at least one partner identifies as LGB and/or T
In relation to this, a new Community Interest Company in the North East, Back on Track, aiming to provide counselling and advocacy for LGB and/or T communities has been interested in how these findings will inform their counselling services. 
i. Broken Rainbow, the national LGBT domestic violence and abuse helpline, with Respect, the national umbrella organisation for domestic violence and abuse perpetrator services, have co-designed a pilot project developing an intervention for LGBT perpetrators. They have submitted a bid for funding for this intervention and have invited the PI and the Co-I to be involved in the evaluation of this pilot project, if funded. 
ii. Hampshire Police have reported to us that, as a result of this project, they now involve Diversity Officers whenever a same-sex domestic violence and abuse case is reported. Early reports suggest that this is having a positive impact for those cases.

iii. In March 2017 we presented a keynote at a half-day event organised by Equation, a domestic violence third sector organisation in Nottingham. The event was about working with perpetrators and they were launching a toolkit for practitioners about working with heterosexual male perpetrators. They are currently waiting to hear about some funding that will allow them to develop the toolkit to make it appropriate to working with LGB and/or T perpetrators and we have agreed to act as advisers on this development.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4A27FA3C-EB6E-4B6B-BA3D-DE1979EB2761</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464700c6a9f48.18519546</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings of the Coral Project are: 
1. The distinctive methodology of recruiting a non-clinical, national community sample has provided new knowledge about the range of violent and potentially abusive behaviours that might be enacted in relationships where one partner identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or trans (LGBT); their attitudes towards relationships; and self-assessment of their own behaviours in relationship (for example, their tendency to be controlling, angry or trusting). This knowledge allows us to achieve one of the project's aims to make sense of how abusive behaviours play out across sexuality and gender. The survey tool has successfully recruited participants who report a profile of coercively controlling behaviour but none of these participants were recruited to interview. Instead, analysis of accounts of violent and potentially abusive acts reported in interviews show these were more often in self-defence or retaliation or reflective of a volatile relationship or one that was about to end. 
The success of the methodology also challenges generic surveys of violence and abuse which commonly make assumptions that any reported incident of violence/abuse is de facto evidence of 'domestic violence'. Our qualitative data demonstrates the importance of understanding context, motivations, impact and meanings of violent and abusive acts. Implications for practice point to the need for more targeted interventions to address different kinds of violence and abuse. 
2. Significant levels of inequality in the provision of interventions in the voluntary and mandatory sectors were found. Implications for LGB and/or T offenders not able to attend accredited perpetrator programmes include harsher sentencing and diminished opportunities for parole. In voluntary and mandatory sectors there are also implications for managing risk and ensuring the safety of their current/ex partners and children. 
3. A key conclusion arising from the findings is the need for a more integrated approach in the delivery of what we call 'relationships services' for LGB and/or T people. Findings showing different motivations for and impacts of violence and abuse taken together with the findings showing many of those seeking formal help opt for counselling and therapy suggest that there is a need for relationships services (sex and relationship education, relationships and other counselling and therapists, youth workers, specialist domestic violence practitioners working with survivors and perpetrators, mainstream practitioners in mental health services, housing, the police and so on), should be better equipped to identify what the needs are of LGB and/or T service users in relation to violence and abuse and better signpost them to appropriate services, including, where appropriate, within criminal justice system. 
4. The survey design and follow-up interviews provide a model for further research including of domestic violence and abuse in heterosexual relationships. This will allow for a more complex unpacking of the violence and abuse being reported as well as better understanding of the needs both of those who report victimisation and those who report the enactment of violence and abuse. In this context, the implications of the Coral Project for more integrated relationships services are also applicable for heterosexual relationships.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As the analysis developed we realised that there were implications of our work beyond that relevant to the domestic violence sector and perpetrator work: including for youth work, sex and relationships education and providers of counselling/therapeutic responses. The methodology was thus altered to include these practitioners in focus groups considering preliminary findings. As a result we intend to provide a series of practitioner briefings aimed at each of the practitioner groups we have identified. We have also been asked to provide case studies for use in training which will be developed as training resources. In line with our recommendations, a pilot intervention project has been developed by Broken Rainbow and Respect which awaits a funding decision. We are currently writing articles aimed at practitioner and mainstream audiences (e.g. Women's Aid SAFE has commissioned an article and asked for a further one).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D225A4F0-B013-4F3F-8109-5D2FE87F8DC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464714fdcbad4.13714763</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/research/areasofresearch/centreforappliedsocialsciences/projects/abusivepartnersinsamesexrelationships/#d.en.55480</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A8D8A0D8-20D3-4B2F-AF09-1318D44C45BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Domestic Violence</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9283fd63ccc8cbf3f844a7aba16a9299"><gtr:id>9283fd63ccc8cbf3f844a7aba16a9299</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barnes R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-137-52452-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58ca5569df5cc8.33186713</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>540CD7DD-BFD1-4338-83C6-B3023CE3E3EF</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Making sense of abusive behaviour in LGBT intimate relationships'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Women's Aid Safe The Domestic Abuse Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6af0401d88af2838268799ea0e352c74"><gtr:id>6af0401d88af2838268799ea0e352c74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Donovan, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ca53a3cc9651.84450210</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J012580/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
