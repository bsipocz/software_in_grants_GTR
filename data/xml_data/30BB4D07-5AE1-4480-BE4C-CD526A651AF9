This is illustrated in UNESCO reports that show that the number of students in post 16 education worldwide rose fivefold to 150.6 million between 1970 and 2007 (UNESCO 2009); this trend looks set to continue. One major impact of the expansion of HE in English-dominant (ED) settings and in universities offering English medium instruction (EMI) elsewhere has been an increase in the cultural and linguistic diversity of the staff and student population. There are two key groups contributing to this increased linguistic and cultural diversity. One is composed of mobile students and faculty; these are international students, academic and research staff attracted to work and study in ED settings or in universities offering EMI. Many are bi/ multilingual users of English with high levels of proficiency in at least two languages: their mother tongue and English. The other is composed of widening participation students, that is groups of home students who have traditionally been underrepresented in HE in ED settings but who have been encouraged to enter the sector through government policies. In the UK, for example, this has resulted in increasing numbers of bi/ multilingual university students from working class migrant communities. Most are bi/ multilingual in that they routinely experience their lives in the heritage language(s) of their families and English. Generally speaking, these students have received little formal schooling in their heritage language(s) and normally have much higher proficiency in English than their heritage language(s). This situation is mirrored to a greater or lesser extent in other ED settings, such as the United States. These factors mean that there are now many more bi/multilingual users of English in the sector than was previously the case. On some university programmes in the UK, for example, it has become common for bi/multilingual users of English to outnumber their monolingual English-speaking counterparts. A parallel issue impacting on linguistic diversity in the sector is the revitalisation agenda for 'indigenous' languages in ED settings, that is minority languages that have been traditionally associated with particular geographical regions, such as Welsh in Wales, Gaelic in Scotland, Maori in New Zealand, and various 'aboriginal' or 'native' languages in Australia, the US and Canada.

Research to date indicates that universities in ED settings have been slow to acknowledge the bi/multilingualism in their midst, to value the linguistic diversity of their bi/multilingual staff and student population, or to regard this diversity as a resource. Instead, the dominant institutional approach to linguistic diversity has been to treat it as a problem that needs solving. This deficit model characterises bi/multilingual users of English as in need of English language remediation and ignores or stigmatises bi/multilingual language resources. As EMI programmes and institutions proliferate in the non-Anglophone world, there is a danger that these Anglo-centric attitudes to linguistic diversity will be reproduced in EMI contexts.

This seminar series aims to develop a research agenda for examining the impact of linguistic diversity in HE in ED and EMI settings and to illuminate the idea of the 'multilingual university' in these contexts. It intends to establish a forum for examining bi/multilingualism in the HE sector and produce resources on this topic that will inform HE policies that create the conditions for linguistic diversity, in particular HE agendas on internationalisation, widening participation and language revitalisation. This will enable the sector to treat the linguistic diversity embodied in its bi/ multilingual staff and student population as a resource for enriching the sector and for promoting a vibrant and fair society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this seminar series?

There will be two main types of beneficiary: academic and research staff and user groups. The academic and research staff encompass i) those engaged in research on bi/multilingualism in educational contexts, contexts of migration or language revitalisation, and those specifically involved in research on bi/multilingualism in HE contexts in ED and EMI settings ii) those working on issues of cultural diversity in HE from disciplinary perspectives such as the sociology of education and higher education studies, including academic colleagues who have not yet focused on the linguistic diversity that accompanies cultural diversity in the sector. 

The user group encompasses two main sets of professional staff and policy makers: the first focuses on those concerned with the planning, delivery and support of English language, academic skills and writing programmes and other support services for members of the HE population in ED and EMI settings who use English as a second, foreign or additional language; the second focuses on those concerned with the planning, delivery and support of HE programmes in ED settings for the education and training of bi/multilingual professionals working with indigenous and community language users in the Anglophone world. The former includes English language tutors, academic support tutors, a range of professional staff involved in internationalisation activities or in access and widening participation in both the HE and FE sectors. The latter includes professional developers involved in the education and training of professionals for whom bi/ multilingual use of community or minority languages in ED settings is essential for professional development, such as translators and interpreters, teachers of minority and community languages, journalists, media workers, health and social care workers serving linguistic minority communities.

How will they benefit?

Academic and research staff will benefit from the opportunity for inter-sector engagement on the phenomenon of bi/multilingualism in ED and EMI settings. In particular, dialogue between scholars with expertise of bi/multilingual education in compulsory and complementary schooling, language revitalisation initiatives or bi/multilingual learners in contexts of migration will help to advance thinking and theorising of the 'multilingual university' as an emergent concept in ED and EMI settings. Bringing these scholars together with those who focus on cultural diversity in HE will enable greater understanding to emerge regarding the interrelationship between linguistic and cultural diversity in the HE sector. This group will also benefit from the experiential knowledge of practitioners and professional staff on dealing with linguistic diversity of a diverse range of students and faculty in HE.

The academic and research staff will benefit from the generation of research collaborations for academics and researchers at different stages of their careers. The seminar series is designed to build capacity for research and scholarship on bi/multilingualism in HE in ED and EMI settings, which is an under researched area, and to provide an evidence base for informing HE policy and practice. We will plan for international impacts in the form of continued international research networking and collaborative research into the impact of linguistic diversity in ED and EMI settings informed by the theoretical frameworks developed in the seminar series. 

The user groups will benefit from a sustained opportunity to clarify thinking on bi/multilingual learners and faculty in the sector and to critique the dominant approach to linguistic diversity in ED and EMI settings. Members of the user groups will also benefit from having the opportunity to express their ideas on ways of meeting the seminar objectives and will be encouraged to participate in the website and the creation of links to practitioner resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28913</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Simon Fraser University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Visiting Research Scholar</gtr:description><gtr:id>E4E78BE1-7D03-4665-8AC0-02057FA3AA73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open talk at CELLTR

Firstly, the seminars established that there are a growing number of staff (including academics, researchers and administrators) and students in universities in the anglophone world who are bi- or multilingual. These staff and students are bringing an array of languages, as well as different varieties of English, into the sector. 
The seminar series explored three key drivers that have contributed to the increase in linguistic diversity in the sector. The first of these is the internationalisation of higher education. Internationalisation has encouraged international mobility among academics, researchers and students. The direction of travel is largely from non English speaking countries to universities in the anglophone world, with large numbers of international students seeking to enter more prestigious institutions. The seminar series found that some courses in UK universities are now primarily composed of international students who are bilingual users of English. (2) Widening participation. Higher education initiatives to comply with UK government policies on increasing access to higher education for under represented groups in the UK population has resulted in a rise in the numbers of students from Black and minority ethnic communities as well as those from working class backgrounds. The seminar series found that WP students from BME communities are likely to be English-dominant bi and multilingual individuals (using English and the languages of minority communities in the UK, such as Urdu). When social class is taken into account, WP students from working class backgrounds are likely to be more familiar with non standard varieties of English. A similar picture emerges from universities in other countries in anglophone settings who have pursued widening participation agendas although with country and regional variations. Unlike international students, WP students are likely to be clustered in less prestigious universities. (3) Language revitalisation. The seminar series found that universities in Wales and Scotland were playing a key role in the revitalisation of Welsh (in Wales) and Gaelic (in Scotland). Universities in these settings have devised institutional language policies that foster bilingual education (Welsh-English or Gaelic-English) for their own institutions, initiatives such as programmes offering bilingual medium of instruction, dedicated space in the university for students and staff to immerse themselves in Welsh or Gaelic, bilingual signage, websites and written materials etc. The seminar series also found that universities in Wales and Scotland were leading teacher education programmes that aim to enable schoolteachers to deliver bilingual education in Welsh and Scottish schools. 
The seminar series found that bi- and multilingualism is being fostered in universities outside the anglophone world by the growth of programmes and courses in which English is used as a medium of instruction. In some cases, English is creating a bilingual situation (e.g. in Italian higher education in which Italian was previously the main or only medium of instruction). In others countries (e.g. regions of Spain such as Catalonia), English is entering an already bilingual setting (i.e. Catalan-Spanish) and creating trilingual approaches to teaching and learning (English-Catalan-Spanish). The spread of English as a medium of instruction in universities outside anglophone countries has been pushed by the internationalisation of higher education and the need for universities in Europe (and beyond) to compete for international students and staff. It is clear that universities perceive English to be key in attracting international students although evidence emerged during the seminar series to indicate that other major languages, such as Spanish, were also attractive to international students. Thus international students may well apply to universities in Spain because they wish to study in Spanish, not in English. 
The seminar series found that the sector had not kept pace with the increasing linguistic diversity in their midst. In universities in English-dominant countries, there is little acknowledgement of bi- or multilingualism among the staff and student population. When linguistic diversity comes up, it is generally treated as a problem. There is little understanding at institutional level of how the linguistic diversity of bi and multilingual staff and students could be of benefit for core university activities: teaching, learning and research. In English as a medium of instruction settings in universities outside the anglophone world, the pace of change is often outstripping the institutional support available for academics to make the switch into using English (instead of their dominant language) for the purposes of teaching and learning and for administrators to be able to deliver professional services in English to international students. This is posing a series of challenges for staff in these settings. However, set against the challenges, the seminar series also found evidence of a considerable amount of bottom up activity in which staff and students were engaged in finding ways of treating linguistic diversity as a resource for teaching, learning and research. The series established that there was an emerging body of research related to the development of plurilingual approaches to education in higher education, the value of linguistic diversity to bi- and multilingual students for their studies and for developing social networks, and the important role of bi and multilingual researchers for research teams and for the development of knowledge from research activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To view linguistic diversity and bi- and multilingualism positively and as an asset for individual and societal well being and development.
