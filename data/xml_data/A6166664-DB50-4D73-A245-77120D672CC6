Studies have shown that while attending these services, patients usually do better than those who receive routine care in a number of areas. Patients usually receive these expensive intensive treatments for 2 to 3 years after they first become unwell. We are trying to find out if the benefits that were evident during treatment endure after patients have completed their specialist treatment (i.e. do the benefits endure?)

Our study will look at hospital use in two groups of patients who were randomised to specialist services and routine care over 5 years ago. We will examine hospitalisation rates in the two groups as a means of assessing the efficacy of the services they attended when they were first unwell.

This is an important area to research because health planners and psychiatric services hope that early intensive treatment will reduce hospital use in the long term. This long-term reduction will hopefully mean better quality of life for patients as well as lower costs associated with hospital use. 

This research will be helpful to both clinicians and service providers because providing these specialist services entails a major reorganisation of services and requires additional funding. The findings will have immediate applicability to researchers, clinicians, and strategic planners in mental health.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Department of Health recently recommended that 50 new clinical services be set up in the UK to treat patients with first episode psychosis. It is believed that these services will improve patient outcomes. However, while there is some evidence that early intervention in this group may improve short term outcome, the critical issue of whether this is true in the longer term has yet to be examined.

A recent comparison of patients with first episode psychosis (in Lambeth, South London) randomised to either specialised intervention by a specialised community team or care as usual found that after 18 months patients in the specialised treatment arm were less likely to be readmitted to hospital or to have disengaged with services. 

The present proposal is designed to follow up the two groups of 70 patients originally recruited to the above study and re-assess them four years after their first episode. These groups will be compared with a third group of 70 first episode patients who were recruited from the same catchment area. This group provides a comparison population for the original two and was recruited after the end of the original trial when the specialist clinical services had been further funded and developed. In addition to the original community team, this third group received an intensive management package involving a rapid assessment team and an inpatient unit. They will also be assessed 4 years after their first episode. 

The design is thus a naturalistic four year follow-up of patients with first episode psychosis from the same part of South London who received three different forms of intervention. The null hypothesis is that the type of intervention provided will have no impact on the long term outcome following the first episode of schizophreniform psychosis. Rather, it is predicted that outcome will be related to the Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP), independent of the form of intervention. Outcome will be evaluated in terms of clinical measures, social function and occupational function.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>256389</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Theragenetics Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Genetic Determinants of Antipsychotic Response</gtr:description><gtr:id>A42E235D-0F61-4CF0-A737-3498349AF098</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research project has enabled me to look at the genetic determinants of outcomes.
