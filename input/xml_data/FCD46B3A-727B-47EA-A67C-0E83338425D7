This notably includes the parasitic, bacterial and viral agents that cause infectious diseases, as well as the organisms that are responsible for disease transmission. The emergence of this data offers new and exciting opportunities to understand these disease-causing agents and to develop novel therapeutics.

An outstanding and challenging problem is to understand the functions of the proteins encoded by these genomes. Time and resources limit the number whose function can be experimentally determined; therefore methods for predicting function are of paramount importance. Moreover, new methods are required when applied to infectious diseases due to the complex relationships between the host organism and the disease causing agent. These associations also have implications for assessing which drugs are suitable for use against infectious diseases and for the development of new therapeutics.

An understanding of the complex biochemical relationships that will facilitate the identifying of new drug targets for infectious diseases requires bringing together a range of diverse biological information. The best method for achieving this is using a multidisciplinary approach interfacing biology, chemistry and computer science techniques. In collaboration with colleagues at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the European Bioinformatics Institute and University College London, I will develop a unique computational resource specifically to handle genomes associated with infectious diseases that:

- brings together relationships between protein sequences and their molecular structures, putting them into an evolutionary context as well as establishing measures of similarity between the functions of these proteins.

- uses the data captured to develop a new method to predict the function of proteins by defining rules bases on the systematic analysis of cases where changes in function occur between related proteins and determining the features of that change.

From the outset of the project, the methods developed will be applied to specific problems in infectious disease research, combined with validating predictions in collaboration with experimental groups. I will start by addressing the key enzymes involved in new drug treatments for Chagas disease, the most important parasitic infection in the Americas, with the aim of providing a better understanding of drug-resistance mechanisms. Predictions and functional annotations of the Trypanosoma and Leishmania genomes, the causative agents of sleeping sickness/Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis respectively, will be made to test the methods and to gain insight into how well they can contribute to enhancing the annotations of these genomes. Insights gained from the application and validation process will be used to further enhance the methods developed, ultimately enabling them to be used on any infectious disease agent. 

The resource and methods developed will also be used to identify new drug targets and possible unintended interactions between the drug and other proteins that may result in side effects in patients. An immediate application will seek to add value to the results of high-throughput drug screens against schistosomes. This trematode worm causes the world's second most socio-economically devastating parasitic disease (highlighted by he World Health Organization). The aim will be to identify which protein(s) the drug(s) might be targeting, and to determine if there is potential for adverse interaction in the human host. 

The research will eventually be of use in a clinical setting, with the real possibility of helping fight the huge variety of infectious diseases suffered by millions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The revolution in high-throughput genome sequencing has resulted in a large amount of data, particularly relating to organisms associated with infectious disease. The outstanding challenge is to relate this information to what occurs functionally at the molecular level. I will develop a unique resource specifically to handle genomes associated with infectious diseases bringing together protein structure, sequence, phylogeny, chemistry, and other interactions with macromolecules, to understand what evolutionary changes are required to alter a function. This will include the development of new methods for comparing polymer interactions such as with lipids, carbohydrates and DNA/RNA as well as integrating pathway and protein-protein interaction information. Cataloguing changes in function will be used to define rules to construct function prediction algorithms to further annotate pathogen genomes. Combining application of the methods developed with validation of function predictions, starting with proteins implicated in Kinetoplastid drug development will be tested in collaboration with experimental groups. One focus will be the enzyme(s) involved in activating the nitroheterocyclic pro-drugs that are the front-line treatment for Chagas disease, the most important parasitic infection in the Americas. Understanding what the cognate ligands and reactions are, as well as possible alternative enzymes with similar activities, is important for gaining insight into drug resistance. Function predictions will be expanded to other infectious disease genomes. Further, the framework will be applied to identify similarities between the metabolites catalogued and results of whole genome high-throughput screening of drug-like compound libraries on Schistosomes, a highly prevalent socio-economic debilitating disease. This could propose new potential drug targets or cross-targets and identify if the disrupted functions have similarities to other functions in vector or host organisms.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Some of the immediate key beneficiaries of the project outcomes are research and development scientists in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. They will benefit from having a freely accessible comprehensive catalogue of relationships between proteins for a range of relevant infectious disease vector and host genomes and their functions. In addition, the methods developed will allow for the prediction of functions of proteins that have yet to be experimentally characterised. Given the relentless output from large scale sequencing projects, the experimental characterization of most of these sequences is impractical and prohibitively costly. 

Moreover, the methods developed will be able to give insight into identifying potential lead compounds to treat infectious diseases, taking into consideration host-pathogen relationships (otherwise, there are a number of implications about which drugs are suitable for use with infectious diseases rather than normal chronic diseases in humans). The new methods developed within this project will be able to capture similarities and differences, not just at the sequence and structural level, but also regarding the chemistry and interaction partners and will thus be complimentary to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Ultimately, the insights gained from function prediction of proteins involved in metabolism of the pro-drugs nifurtimox and benznidazole (currently in Phase III clinical trials), and their effect on drug resistance will have benefit to the many millions of people suffering from diseases caused by Trypanosoma. Likewise, the identification of an enriched list of hits and targets to take forward in the drug development process from the results of high throughput whole-organism screening platforms for schistosomicidal activity could ultimately benefit those suffering from schistosomiasis. There is an urgent need to discover/develop novel therapeutics due to the increasing usage and thus the possibility of developing drug resistance to the one drug, praziquantel, which is available for treatment of schistosomes.

In the long term, by cataloging the evolutionary changes in function between proteins and generating sets of rules that encapsulate them, these will be useful in a general context for researchers working in the biotechnology, food and agrochemical sectors. The 'rules' can be used in enzyme design efforts to produce novel organic synthesis, to generate new products or high yields of specific stereoisomers, to name but a few. 

Other beneficiaries include those in education at the undergraduate level, but also at the secondary school level, as the freely accessible resource will be generated can be used to teach and study the principles of evolution, protein structure and function. In particular it can be used to demonstrate concepts in enzyme functions, which form a significant component of a number of syllabi.

The proposed research is highly collaborative and will allows those involved in the project to receive not only transferable technical skills and knowledge, but also to form a network of contacts and working relationships amongst the academic and industrial communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>339628</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CATH collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>0468F108-1185-4D9F-AC87-E85BD022C7A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PMID: 25348408</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54575d1655a4a2.51367953-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Orengo group has provided their expertise in protein domain classification and generating structurally informed multiple sequence alignments.
