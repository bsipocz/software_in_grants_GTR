Both the LiME and TARF-LCV programmes were founded on our long-term vision for full metal circulation: that the global demand for metallic materials should be met by a full circulation of secondary metals with only limited addition of primary metals each year, which can be achieved by effective reuse, remanufacture, closed-loop recycling and effective recovery of secondary metals. This full metal circulation represents a paradigm shift for metallurgical science, manufacturing technology and the industrial landscape. LiME was founded to provide a solid foundation for full metal circulation. Although substantial progress [3] has been made in the fundamental understanding of heterogeneous nucleation, developing new metallic materials and advancing casting technologies under both LiME and TARF-LCV the industrial adoption and exploitation of the research output has been constrained, mainly due to the lack of scale-up facilities to take the lab-proven concepts and processing technologies to a suitable level, at which industrial companies are willing to take the risk to conduct industrial trials. 

We propose to establish a unique national scale-up facility for light metal casting research to be hosted in the Advanced Metal Casting Centre (AMCC) at Brunel University. AMCC aims to bridge the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications. Together with the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Liquid Metal Engineering (LiME for short), the AMCC will provide high performance light alloys, resource efficient casting technologies and component innovations to meet the long- and mid-term needs of the automotive industry. To set up the AMCC we are requesting &amp;pound;3.9M from EPSRC to match a &amp;pound;2.5M investment by B University for capital equipment and infrastructure and &amp;pound;3.15M cash and &amp;pound;3.36M in-kind contributions from our industrial partners for the initial research projects. The scale-up facilities will be installed in a purpose-built 1000m2 laboratory complete with power, water and gas supply. The new facilities will enable and enhance our established research capability in many different areas, such as liquid metal engineering, alloy development, processing technologies and component innovation. We will work closely with the automotive industry and its supply chain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Advanced Metal Casting Centre (AMCC) will provide state-of-the-art scale-up facilities for advanced light metal casting, to exploit world leading research and development in resource efficient processing of high performance alloys. The AMCC builds directly on the EPSRC's strategic investment in the Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Liquid Metal Engineering (LiME for short) to enhance the UK's capability in this important technological area. The academic impact of the AMCC and LiME comes from both the research activities and their direct application using the scaled-up casting facilities. The proposed scale-up facilities are unique in the UK, and cannot be found in any other UK university or within the TSB supported High Value Manufacturing Catapult Centres. These unique facilities will be made open access to the UK solidification and casting community, to strengthen solidification research in the UK and its international standing. The academic impact of the AMCC and LiME also derives from its ground-breaking research activities. The scientific deliverables from the AMCC and LiME represent major advances in solidification science, physical metallurgy, high performance metallic materials and resource efficient casting technologies. 

The key focus of the AMCC facilities and R&amp;amp;D activities is on transportation but specifically its initial impact will be on the UK automotive industry and its supply chain and then the wider transportation industry. Specifically, the automotive industry will benefit because: (1) for the first time the UK automotive industry and its supply chain will have direct access to a dedicated R&amp;amp;D centre for the development of resource efficient processing technologies for the production of high performance metallic materials; (2) the AMCC together with LiME will be a sandpit for the UK automotive industry and its supply chain; (3) the AMCC will work closely with the automotive OEMs to rebuild UK's domestic supply chain which has been hollowed-out in last 30 years; (4) the shortened lead time from technology concept to industrial production; (5) advanced manufacturing technologies to provide technological advantages over competitors; (6) sustainable light weight high performance metallic materials with reduced cost; and (7) improved sustainability due to reduced CO2 emissions, conservation of natural resources and consequently reduced environmental impact. The overall benefits to the UK automotive industry and its supply chain from the AMCC will be profound, and will make a major contribution to rebalancing the UK economy. 

The potential environmental sustainability impact of the proposed scale-up facilities and enabled research activities in the AMCC and LiME is profound as the research and industrial application outputs will have a dramatic influence on the practicality of curbing the carbon emissions from the global automotive fleet in a timely manner. The research output of closed-loop recyclable light alloys and advanced processing technologies represents a vital strand of an integrated national approach to transport decarbonisation. 

Training people has been a key focus of the AMCC as it has been for LiME in support of EPSRC's Delivery Plan. There will be over 10 early-career academics and senior research fellows, 40 post-doctoral researchers and PhD research students being trained in the AMCC and LiME research programme, and some of them will become the future leaders in solidification and casting research. The AMCC will become the training ground for skilled engineers for the UK automotive OEMs and their supply chain. Over 30 industrial engineers from automotive OEMs and their supply chain will be directly working in the AMCC (either full time or part time) to participate or support the AMCC research programme. Special training programmes will be developed to refresh and upgrade their metallurgical knowledge, especially in solidification science and casting technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2024-01-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3855000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>787567</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Constellium - AMCC Programme - Research Fellows</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Constellium</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>CE7B99FF-E56F-4D27-B057-B7C1717085B8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ff3f330003.17929776</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>390000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Next Generation of Automotive Casting Alloys</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Jaguar Land Rover</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>BC12D064-C922-4736-9DDF-F195E5AC2092</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ff9d7c6d03.91245317</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>37000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>PhD Studentship - Aluminium Alloy Development</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Jaguar Land Rover</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>03EE0D4E-3BF3-4890-81EB-11048D9C9BEF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c813303fc9e7.47220619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>340000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Melt Conditioned Direct Chill Casting of Aluminium Alloys</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>SAPA</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>910E955B-05D2-4E50-9DEF-8C015BF69EEA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c8126a48e211.81134120</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>15000000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>(AMCC2) Advanced Metals Casting Centre Phase II</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>048D70CA-C297-44D0-A447-51FF10754E1F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c811a9b5d283.21468739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>699358</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Aluminium Carbon Fibre Hybrid Structures (CAAHS)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Technology Strategy Board (TSB)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D02AEE00-F039-49F9-9DE8-CAC5596541E8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c812db556771.23764097</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As this is an equipment grant it does not fund research directly.
