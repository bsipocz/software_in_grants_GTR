Even in the most recent Care Planning Guidance (DCSF 2010a), sexual orientation and gender identity are not mentioned as issues that may need to be taken into account in ensuring the well-being of young people in care. This is a matter for concern when research suggests that both LGBT young people and young people in care are at risk of stigma, discrimination, bullying and mental health difficulties. There is the potential, therefore, for LGBT young people in care to face a 'double jeopardy'. This is likely to be especially true in adolescence and when making the transition from care to adulthood, a period known to present challenges in relation to identity formation and forming close relationships, in addition to the practical difficulties of finding housing and employment. However we also need to understand what may promote resilience.

This study's objectives are to investigate how LGBT young people experience growing up in care and how they negotiate their identities. Of particular interest is the exploration of the intersectional relationship between care and LGBT statuses, understood in the context of the multiplicity of other factors, such as ethnicity, experiences of abuse, separation and loss that also affect and contribute to identity formation. The study will also explore the national provision of services and support for LGBT young people in care and will investigate the experiences of foster carers who care for them. A group of young researchers who are care-experienced and/or identify as LGBT will assist with designing recruitment materials, piloting interviews and helping with the analysis and dissemination/impact. 

The study will use a mixed methods, layered design to capture the different types of knowledge that are needed. 
 1. A scoping review of the UK and international policy, research and practice literature relevant to young people in care who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. 
 2. In-depth narrative interviews with a sample of 40 LGBT young people age 16-25 who are currently or were previously in care. This sample will be recruited through multiple routes, including: local authorities; specialist groups for LGBT young people; organisations for young people in care /care leavers; Independent Reviewing Officer organisations; fostering organisations; and snowballing through participants informing other possible participants. The interviews will focus on enabling young people to describe their sense of identity; their experiences in placement; their contact with birth relatives; their relationships with close friends, partners and peer groups; their contact with professionals (e.g. teachers, social workers); and their experience in the wider community. Narrative analysis of the interviews will be used to provide an in-depth and nuanced understanding of identity development.
 3. Interviews with 25 foster carers who have experience of caring for LGBT young people. These will provide information from carers about the young people's experiences, but also about how carers see their roles, relationships and the support they need. Data will be analysed thematically using NVivo. 
 4. A survey of local authority and independent agency policy, provision and practice to identify services available to LGBT young people in care or leaving care.
 5. Multi-agency focus groups with a range of professionals, held towards the end of the project, will explore the policy and practice issues emerging from the literature review, survey and qualitative interviews. 

The research team has a pathway to impact plan, which will enable findings to achieve impact on outcomes for young people e.g. policy consultation, training materials, practitioner guide, digital technology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most important beneficiaries of the research will be LGBT young people in care and in the transition to adulthood. The research will help policy makers, managers, practitioners and caregivers improve the effectiveness of services and the quality of care for a particular group of young people for whom the state is the 'corporate parent'. Therefore further beneficiaries of the research, in addition to the young people, will be foster carers and residential workers; a wide range of child and family welfare practitioners including IROs; child and family social workers and managers; fostering social workers in the local authority and independent sector; Cafcass children's guardians; child and adolescent mental health services; virtual School heads; lawyers and judges; councillors; and government policy makers.
 This research will provide new information, as well as build on and extend other research on children in care undertaken at UEA and elsewhere to improve our understanding of the needs of this particular group of young people in ways that translate into practice. Young people who identify as LGBT will have many of the same needs as all other young people in care - for safety, attachment security, resilience, a sense of belonging, positive identity and self-esteem, good physical and mental health, educational achievement, positive peer relationships and so on. We will learn from this research how the particular intersection of being LGBT and in care is experienced, and helps or hinders the achievement of these psychosocial and developmental goals within the care system. 
 This knowledge will support foster and residential caregivers as well as a range of professionals in being alert to the experiences of young people and any signs and signals that the young person needs particular support. To achieve this, practice guidance and training materials as well as practitioner appropriate research summaries will be produced. This will be linked to our agreement with BAAF to undertake knowledge transfer through digital technology, publications and conferences/training events. We also have a network of contacts in the local authority sector through Making Research Count. As the majority (76%) of young people in care are in foster care a particular focus will be on messages for foster carer recruitment, preparation, training and support.
 Key to ensuring that young people do benefit from the availability of new knowledge and understanding of their experiences is the fact that issues of sexual orientation and gender identity need to be handled sensitively. Questions of confidentiality and of a young person 'coming out' to friends or family are significant for all LGBT young people, but the (at times) public nature of the life of young people in care may create additional challenges to the young person and those closest to him or her. In particular the Looked After Children reviewing system requires a statutory six monthly review process that includes sharing of assessment documentation and a meeting that may include a range of professionals, not all of whom are well-known to the young person. The care planning regulations and guidance (DCSF, 2010a) has indicated that this should be treated as the child's meeting, with the child wishes, feelings and welfare at the heart of the planning. This research will assist LGBT young people in getting their voices heard and help IROs and other professionals in supporting this process. 
 For professional networks, an additional benefit of the detailed access to LGBT young people's experiences and perspectives is that we will also learn about all of their environments, both within the care system (e.g. LAC reviews) and in the community (e.g. School) and what professional responses worked well or where improvement is needed. This will in turn be built into guidance and on-line training materials that will inform and support best practice to reduce risk and promote resilience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282016</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UCU Manchester sexual orientation, gender identity, LGBTQI lives conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6987D49B-B287-4AAC-B78E-15BA838BA4B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of the research aims and objectives, methodology and recruitment process to an audience of union members, third sector organisations.
