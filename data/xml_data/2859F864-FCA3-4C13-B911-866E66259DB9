develop and evaluate school-based interventions aimed at increasing levels of physical activity amongst students at the start of secondary school, thereby increasing feeling of wellbeing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Lack of physical activity is a persistent and growing problem in this age group. Further about one in ten school-aged children suffer psychological problems such as anxiety, depression and conduct disorders.Taking regular physical activity can enhance the psychological, as well as physical health of young people. However, to date, national attempts to address this issue have not met with great success.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The MJVE project involves two school-based interventions in a clustered, randomised control trial with schools allocated to one of the interventions, or both, or to a control group. The 'participatory learning' intervention will run through Geography lessons using GPS; and a 'personal coach' intervention, linked to Physical Education classes. Both involve innovative student participation and collaboration with teachers, as well as capturing data for the research. Measures of wellbeing and physical activity will be collected using questionnaires, and using activity monitors and measures of height and weight. Information will be recorded at several time points to assess the success of the interventions.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal offers the potential to impact on the nation's health and wealth. The work is designed to lead to national school-based interventions which have a direct impact on the mental health of children. If successful this will have implications for many young people and their families. A sizable proportion of the population's lives is blighted by mental health problems and this is not only an individual source of great distress, but at a societal level, it has a significant negative impact on the economy. (One recent estimate to the national economy of depression alone, via lost working days, deaths and NHS resources, put the cost at &amp;pound;9 billion pounds per year, Thomas and Morris, 2003). 

In recognition of the importance of the issues tackled by this proposal, the Government has spent millions of pounds on the Targeted Mental Health in Schools and the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) projects. There is considerable national interest on mental health in schools and this research speaks directly to that interest, although our focus is very different from those initiatives.
The proposed research also has the potential to inform our understandings of how to effect large-scale changes in young people's behaviour and findings are likely to be of significant interest to policymakers. Insights obtained are likely to be particularly welcomed by such bodies as the Government's new Behavioural Insight Team (colloquially known as the &amp;quot;nudge&amp;quot; unit), which seeks to use insights from behavioural economics to assist individuals to make better choices for themselves. Many of the elements of our proposed project (e.g. the importance of social norms, and aligning long and short-term preferences through the use of self-commitment devices) draw upon similar principles and mechanisms to those outlined in the 'nudge' choice architecture literature. Thus, the study seeks to introduce an intervention that maps on closely to those approaches recently identified by Governent as helping to fulfil its 'big society' agenda.
Staff working on the project will gain significant experience of working with leading international researchers across a variety of academic disciplines. They will gain opportunities to utilise and evaluate the potential contribution of different research methods. They will gain valuable experience of collaborating with students and staff in schools in developing fully participatory forms of action and evaluation. Such experience will be valuable for a variety of future professional roles in education. Exploration of the research potential of different forms of leading-edge electronic equipment will provide staff with valuable skills for similar future research projects.

Timescale: Following the dissemination of findings from a successful project, it is reasonable to expect other research and professional groups, as well as the original team, to build on that success in the following few years. An active national policy could incorporate the message from the research into policy within five years.

The impact of this ESRC grant has been and/or will be in three areas: Schools, academic discourse and policy. At the moment (March 2016) the greatest impact has been in schools but over time we expect that the impact on academic discourse and policy will increase.
Schools: The project involved two different interventions in schools, a participative learning approach which was taught in geography lessons, and a peer mentoring approach, often linked to PE. Bespoke materials were created for the lessons by the research team, and were made available to schools after the project finished. In a survey to the teachers at the end of the trial, 75% of peer mentoring teachers considered using the materials in the future, and 57% of the geography teachers would use the materials again. This response is promising and shows the materials are likely to be used again in some schools involved in the trial.
 Academic discourse: We have presented 13 papers at conferences and more presentations are planned. Each of these presentations has a paper associated with it which we aim to publish. As each paper is published we will also send copies to cited academics and to influential people in education and health policy. The BMJ Open paper was sent to all cited authors. We anticipate that the results will appear in meta-analyses and systematic reviews.
Policy: At this stage we are working on publications and the main paper is now published. We did not feel that we should attempt to influence policy until that paper had been accepted for publication but it has now been sent to a key education policy advisers in England (Tim Leunig, Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Analyst at the Department for Education) and Scotland (Laura Farquhar); an offer has been made to run a seminar to share findings in Scotland and England. The paper has also been send to the Youth Sports Trust and Public Health England.
The paper is in the top 5% of all research papers scored by Altimetric for January 2016, and 39% of retweets have been by members of the public.

More broadly
At this stage the results have mainly been used locally and on a small scale to feedback information to the schools and local authorities which were involved with the project. We have devoted most of our time to ensuring that the field work including data collection was completed but we are still engaged in collecting some follow up questionnaire data. 
A series of preparatory conference papers have been given which will lead to publications. We are now working on the data which will also lead on to publications. 
One important impact has been the passing on of GIS expertise from the Durham University to schools. 
We anticipate that the results will lead to further work on the use of accelerometers as an intervention in themselves and that the main findings will be used in systematic reviews of attempts to increase levels of MVPA.
The work on the SDQ and Kidscreen should have an impact of the choice of instruments for large scale studies and a paper has now been submitted for publication.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0C7FE17E-A270-453B-A27D-4AFE66471DFD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460ce01864ee2.01416991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have now completed the main paper and are completing other papers for publication and the key findings, so far, are outlined below. 
A) From the BMJ Open paper
Main findings
This intervention study sought to modify the MVPA levels of children in their first year of secondary school, with the intention of enhancing feelings of well-being. We found no evidence of a significant effect of either intervention alone, or in combination, on these outcomes. When adjusting for covariates, the largest difference in PA was observed between the participative learning group and control, with these children doing an average of 3 min more of MVPA per day. Similarly the largest effect on total well-being scores was observed for the participative learning intervention.
Conclusion 
Although Bonell et al call for greater attention to mental and physical health in schools, it is becoming increasingly clear that relatively modest classroom initiatives on the present scale are insufficient to change children's levels of PA. A multicomponent PA intervention targeting the home, school and wider neighbourhood environment may prove to be a more promising approach and might be usefully informed by the kinds of information collected through the interventions reported above. This could include structural changes to enable adolescents to travel safely in their environment and the provision of exclusion zones around schools where motorised transport is prohibited. Changes to educational policy to shift the accountability focus away from test results may also help. However, in identifying possible local solutions to low levels of PA among children, one must be cognisant of broader, and complex, ecosystemic influences that result in patterns of behaviour that are far from easy to address or resolve.B) 

B) The SDQ and Kidscreen (submitted)
The analysis of data from nearly two and a half thousand students who had completed the SDQ and KIDSCREEN-27 generated some useful comparisons. Despite extensive evidence relating to widespread use of the SDQ we found issues with the language used, low person reliability and evidence of DIF by sex. We did not find similar problems with KIDSCREEN-27.
We recommend that any project embarking on large scale survey work of children's mental health and wellbeing consider the KIDSCREEN-27 as an alternative to the SDQ. 

C) Physical activity and sedentary time

Few school-aged children engage in sufficient physical activity (PA) to benefit health. 


Analyses indicated that Year 7 students are less sedentary on weekends but engage in more MVPA on weekdays. Approximately 50% of the population actively travel to school, and those who walk to/from school accrue around 10 minutes more MVPA per day than those who take passive modes of transport.

Schools should remain a prime target for interventions to increase PA and reduce sedentary time, with active school travel a potentially important focus. 
D) Qualitative Findings 

Children see different outdoor spaces and places as being 'good' for physical activity. Thoughts about more formalised outdoor activity spaces elicited comments about 'lots of space' as well as enjoyment of equipment and social networking opportunities. 
Factors which were felt to prevent the children engaging in more physical activity included roads, dark nights, weather, local gangs and lack of peers. 
E) Using GIS as a tool in schools

The PL intervention involved GIS techniques incorporated into Geography lessons. Preliminary results show: how pupils' knowledge and skills in GIS were improved; how pupils interpreted their movement in their daily action space and related this to their physical activity level and their vision of how their environment could be changed to help them enhance their physical activity levels.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In four broad ways:
1) The quantitative findings from the interventions may be used by 
a. schools, local authorities and policy makers in deciding whether to adopt the interventions or not (see the objectives listed above).
b. researchers wishing to show find how physical activity levels can be increased either by primary research or through meta-analyses and other research syntheses in looking at attempts to increased levels of physical activity and feelings of well-being
2) The inherent educational value of introducing GIS into Year 7 may be built on by schools 
3) There are three methodological issues which were addressed which will be useful to other researchers
a. How data from RCTs in social science which are considered to be missing not at random (MNAR) can be analysed.
b. The well-being outcome measure was assessed using Kidscreen but will also collected data on the more commonly used SDQ instrument. Comparing the two has produce findings relevant to large scale survey work .
c. We succeed in collecting the data from many secondary schools but it was by no means easy and other researchers will befit from knowing of the difficulties and how we solved them.
4) There are relationships in the data, which the project did not set out to explore, which will be useful for workers seeking to improved physical activity levels and feeling of wellbeing. These include:
a. The amount of sedentary behaviour among Year 7 students: Preliminary analyses show this population of Year 7 students spend 7 hours per day sedentary, with very few meeting daily MVPA recommendations.
b. The possibility that feelings of wellbeing are related to students BMI both in absolute terms and relative to others in the class.
c. The possible variation of systematic variation in feelings of wellbeing according to the time of years.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>568B52B8-4273-4239-A77D-2BC592BC3428</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460cdc3dc3b96.57390905</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.move-project.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The data, which have been deposited and under discussion with ReShare, are the quantitative data from the trial.
