concentration and other impurities in produced water.
Produced water is water trapped in underground formations that is brought to the surface
along with oil. This results in harmful oils &amp;amp; contaminants being dumped into the
environment that include crude oil carcinogens e.g. Xylene and Benzene - as well as the
unnecessary loss of valuable oil.
Approximately 2450 bn gallons of produced water are generated pa worldwide - by far the
largest volume of waste stream associated with oil exploration and production.
It has been in contact with the hydrocarbon-bearing formation for centuries - it contains some
of the chemical characteristics of the formation and the oil itself. May also include water
from or injected into the reservoir, and any chemicals added during the production &amp;amp;
treatment processes. The physical, chemical properties of produced water varies considerably
depending on the location, the geological host formation, and the type of oil being produced.
Produced water properties and volume can also vary throughout the lifetime of a reservoir.
The nature of the problem is that the cost of managing produced water is a significant factor
in the profitability of oil production.
Also, in order to dispose of produced water economically and with the least environmental
damage it is essential to be able to accurately measure the oil &amp;amp; contaminants present in
produced water. This is also vital so that process control can be monitored and optimised and
to determine whether any oil can be extracted from the produced water.
The problem with existing measurement technology is that, being lighter, any oil will rise to
the top of the process flow thereby missing any oil in water measurement devices. The
monitors will under measure oil content and over estimate the true efficiency of the
separation process ? these measurements can be wildly inaccurate.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710369</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
