programme provides all second and third year postgraduates in human geography in Scotland with advanced training in research methods and theoretical approaches, beyond what is available in individual Scottish geography departments. The programme is focused on a residential meeting at the beginning of the academic year, facilitating interaction with a peer group and the provision of workshops and training activities. For contributing staff, the course enables continued dialogue over respective research training in different departments across Scotland and the identification/delivery of advanced training needs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The programme consists of three key elements;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Conference-style presentations given by all participating students, in themed sessions&lt;br />&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Workshops (comprising staff-led, student-led and role play sessions on research methods and practice; the themes covered are adapted to suit the needs of students attending)&lt;br />&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Guest lectures (with one or more international geography academics Speakers from policy organisations). The size of the event (approximately 25 students and 8 staff attend) and the venue encourage high levels of student and staff participation and interaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The programme is evaluated in a dedicated session each year. Dissemination of the programme and the report of the event are circulated to all geography department and other interested/relevant bodies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34406</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Scottish Human Geography Pathway (formerly the Scottish Human Geography Postgraduate Consortium)</gtr:description><gtr:id>98EC82E8-FFF6-4C4F-9409-2F04C14EC0EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcomes of the collaboration are advanced training events for human geography PhD students in Scotland, including the residential event funded by this grant, plus assessment and selection of ESRC funded studentships (as part of the Scottish DTC).

The events addressed the discipline-specific needs of postgraduate human geographers, building on the generic and discipline-specific training offered by individual geography units. Indeed, the real strength of the events was that they drew upon the diverse expertise within the six geography units, and so were able to provide a high quality, advanced set of research methods and transferable skills learning beyond what could be offered by one unit. The events provided a range of sessions to develop skills covering the three key elements of the research process - theoretical and conceptual frameworks, matters of methodology, and application and impacts of research - delivered using a set of imaginative and flexible teaching approaches (with an emphasis on interaction and discussion), which were evaluated and revised each year to suit the needs of the particular cohort. The different needs of the two year groups were also taken into consideration in designing the event, with some sessions (e.g. 'role play' of the viva voce, and career options) specifically for those at the beginning of year 3 of PhD, and other sessions (e.g. 'managing your supervisor') targeted at those at beginning of year 2.
There was a strong emphasis in the events on developing awareness and skills amongst the postgraduate students attending to reflect on the wider significance of their research, and the ways in which their research outputs can be applied to exert impact on policy and practice within the academic, private, public and voluntary sectors (and more broadly within the general public). This was achieved in a number of ways: first, the attendance of external academic speakers at the events - high-profile UK and international academics (from geography and other disciplines); second, the attendance of speakers from policy and voluntary sectors to talk to and discuss with students ways in which academic research can be effectively applied in 'real world' situations to exert impact on policy and practice; third, sessions on skills to write up and disseminate academic research within a range of contexts, including policy and the public sphere; fourth, sessions on the wider contexts of the funding, dissemination and impact of research. The involvement of speakers (who stayed for a large part of the event) from outside the academic community established strong connections between the students and these organisations. The longer term impact of this is evidenced by the positions gained by past participants (the event is now well enough established for a first, and indeed second, generation of participants to have successfully taken these research skills into the labour market). As well as holding academic positions (e.g. lectureships and research positions), previous beneficiaries of the event are now in non-academic research related positions within a range of organisations (e.g. Scottish Government). 
In addition, staff attending the event from the six geography units gained an opportunity to meet and network, to discuss and review postgraduate training provision (within individual units and across Scotland), and in many cases forged new research initiatives (e.g. the development of research grant bids, and the delivery of papers at the six universities). In this way, the event formed a central element of the ESRC recognised Consortium (to which 5 PhD Quota Award Studentships were allocated 2008-10) and the wider postgraduate student and staff network of human geographers in Scotland. Further, staff had the opportunity to meet and engage with the visiting UK and international academics, again providing an opportunity to build research links and access new methods of training and learning, and with contributors from the non-academic organisations, providing a mechanism for engagement on research and policy issues and further cementing productive relationships between academia and policy and practice communities. 
The event now forms a core element of the Human Geography Pathway in the Scottish Doctoral Training Centre.
In addition, at the event in 2007, student attendees proposed that a postgraduate network should be established to maintain and build the contacts made at the event, facilitated through email. Further, students suggested that an additional annual one day event should be set up, titled 'Mini-Kindrogan', to bolster the student network. The event is organised and run by students, with a programme of activities, talks, a guest speaker and a social event. This has without doubt strengthened the human geography postgraduate network in Scotland.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Human Geography Pathway (formerly the Scottish Human Geography Postgraduate Consortium) is a model of effective, progressive and innovative (e.g. we had joint supervision arrangements several years before they were considered by the DTC) collaboration between five (formerly six) Geography departments/HEIs.

This particular event (2007-2009) was a residential over four days, with a programme of research training, external academic and non-academic speakers, transferable skills, career planning and networking. The event was for all second and third year PhD students in Human Geography in Scotland, creating an active and supportive cohort of students across the (then) six universities. A student-led event several months later was an unplanned outcome of the event. Together these events developed the skills and capacity of a cohort of PhD students, many of whom are now in academic positions. Further, the established and experienced Human Geography Postgraduate Consortium (lead by Dr. Edward Hall) played a major role in the development of the Scottish DTC; our consortium providing the model for how the disciplinary pathways would work across the DTC.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543fec3738b720.54273516</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-035-25-0009</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/E006000/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
