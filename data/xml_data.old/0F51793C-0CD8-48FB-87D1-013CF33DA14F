The project explores how religious law already functions alongside civil law in the area of marriage and divorce, by examining the working of three religious courts in detail: the Roman Catholic Portsmouth Diocesan Tribunal; the Jewish London Beth Din, Family Division; and the court of the Birmingham Central Mosque. It will focus upon the organisational structure and legal status of these courts and the jurisdiction they have in relation to marriage, divorce and remarriage, areas which are of considerable importance in both religious and State law. The research will involve scrutiny of a sample of files concerning the cases dealt with by the courts and a series of interviews with court personnel. The project is ground-breaking in that although there have been some empirical investigations into the courts or tribunals used by particular religious traditions, no work to date has sought to compare the work of courts or tribunals of different religions and how they relate to the law of the State. \n\nBy providing the missing evidence base, this project will benefit a range of scholars who research law and religion, family law and the sociology of religion. It will also benefit the religious courts themselves and a range of policy-makers and media representatives by bringing them together to discuss the findings at a symposium in month 11 of the project, to which members of two Cardiff-led Networks (the Law and Religion Scholars Network and the Interfaith Legal Advisers Network) will be invited. In addition to informing the general debate, it is also intended that this project will serve as a catalyst for further research into law and religion. \n\nThe proposed project will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team of scholars based at Cardiff University. The Principal Investigator, Douglas, an expert on family law will be joined by Gilliat-Ray, an expert on the sociology of religion, as senior co-applicant. Given the project's strong link with law and religion, two experts in this field Doe and Sandberg, will also form part of the project team. . A Research Assistant will also be employed for the last ten months of the project for the equivalent of four days a week.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The media, political and popular reaction to the Archbishop of Canterbury's lecture underscored how issues concerning the interaction of religious and civil law are of importance to a vast range of people. Commentators (e.g. Bradney 2009b) have noted the debate following the Archbishop's lecture was characterised by a low level of knowledge of religious laws and courts in both political and popular discourse. This research has the potential to change this state of affairs, leading to a better-informed debate. Not only would this be a worthy end in itself but also it might aid the integration of religious and ethnic minorities in the UK, replacing stereotypical fears with concrete evidence. This comparative and empirical project will provide a much needed evidence base which will not only guide the debate but will also be invaluable for all those who come into contact with religious courts. This will involve secular decision-makers at a range of levels, including those who provide legal and other advice and charities and pressure groups who have expressed concern about the operation of religious law, such as the 'One Law for all Campaign'. \n\nMoreover, religious leaders and representatives and religious adherents who choose to use the religious courts, will find this work valuable as well as the personnel of religious courts. Legal advisers who have clients who are seeking to regularise their unions within both religious and civil law will also find the results of the study helpful in adding to their understanding of the inter-relationship between civil and religious legal systems and laws. We also envisage that the three courts studied will benefit from the work, through attendance at a meeting and symposium, as a key objective is to build a long-term relationship with them to prepare the ground for future research which will aid policy-making. For example, the research could lead to indirectly to enhancements in the quality of services provided by these bodies to couples seeking marriage or divorces, an area that very directly impacts on people's quality of life. \n\nA key route for communication of, and engagement with, research findings will be through publications and events, including a project leaflet at the outset, describing the project and activities, for use at future events and meetings; a summary of findings on completion, freely available online; a one-day meeting in London in Month 8, bringing together staff from each of the courts and the project team; and a Symposium in Month 11 of the project, with wide invited participation from the religious courts academics, political, legal and religious advisers, religious organisations, and media representatives.\n\nMembers of two networks run by Centre for Law and Religion at Cardiff will also be invited to the Symposium, for the discussion and dissemination of the findings to the growing number of religious and legal personnel who are joining the networks:\n\n(i) The Interfaith Legal Advisors Network (ILAN), which was established by Cardiff Centre for Law and Religion in 2007. ILAN is wide-ranging in its academic and professional concerns: it includes representatives from over 15 different faith groups and the British Humanist Association. The Archbishop of Canterbury's Secretary for Interfaith Relations and representatives from the Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community have attended past ILAN meetings. \n\n(ii) The Law and Religion Scholars Network (LARSN), established in 2008 which has just under a hundred academics from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as well as a number of members from across the globe (chiefly Australia and the United States).\n\nThe inclusion of legal practitioners and academics in the workshop to discuss findings will lead to more informed legal advice from civil law advisers and law-makers, suppor</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our research has been used to inform public discussion of problems arising from the interface between civil and religious law, and in confidential discussions in government regarding unregistered religious marriages.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C73E55C7-18CB-4959-90C8-084F02CCC7EC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54608ad803c347.33751969</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research explored how religious law functions alongside civil law in the area of marriage and divorce by examining the workings of three religious tribunals in detail: the Catholic National Tribunal for Wales, the London Beth Din and the Shariah Council of the Birmingham Central Mosque. Although we make no claim that these are 'typical' or 'representative' of Christian, Jewish or Islamic tribunals in general, these case studies provide an understanding of how religious courts operate in practice across the three faiths.

None of the institutions we studied operates under the Arbitration Act 1996 in relation to its divorce jurisdiction. Their authority to rule on the validity/termination of a marriage does not derive from the parties' agreement to submit their 'dispute' to them (indeed, there may be no dispute). The role of the Beth Din, for instance, is supervisory: it witnesses the Jewish divorce to ensure the parties divorce each other correctly and that the get document itself is properly drawn up. Although the Beth Din operates under the Arbitration Act 1996 in order to settle civil cases between private individuals or institutions in accordance with Jewish laws, it does not arbitrate on family law matters. The same is true of other religious tribunals in the UK. We are only aware of one Muslim tribunal, the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, which makes use of the Arbitration Act 1996.

The tribunals we studied derive their authority from their religious affiliation, not from the State, and this authority extends only to those who choose to submit to them. Adherents to the particular faith make use of the religious tribunal in order to obtain sanction to remarry within their faith. For believers, being able to remarry within the faith serves both to enable them to remain within their faith community and to regularise their position with the religious authorities. This is particularly crucial in the Jewish religion, because the failure to obtain a get will jeopardise the legitimate status of the parties' future children and descendants.

In most cases, those who approach the religious tribunal are simply seeking a termination of their religious marriage. They will have already sought a termination of their civil marriage through the civil law of divorce. All three institutions encourage the parties to obtain a civil divorce, if applicable, before seeking a religious termination. Indeed, the Catholic Tribunal does not deal with an application for annulment until this has been done, and the Beth Din will not provide the certificate that a get has been given until it has proof of the civil divorce.

Popular understandings of religious tribunals often stress their coercive nature. However, our research showed that each of the institutions firmly recognises and supports the ultimate authority of civil law processes when it comes to marriage and divorce and none seeks greater 'recognition' by the State. They all advise the parties that only the civil courts may give binding rulings in relation to the consequences of the divorce. And both the Beth Din and the Shariah Council regard the obtaining of a civil divorce as clear evidence of the parties' view that the marriage is over.

Our research also pointed to an element of consumer choice. 'Forum shopping' exists to some extent within the Jewish and Muslim communities, as there is no 'hierarchy' or system of appeal for Shariah Councils or the Beth Din. Litigants can choose which tribunal they go to according to the way in which (they think) the law will be applied to them or by what they perceive will be the extent of recognition of the tribunal's decision across their community. All of the institutions we studied clearly see their work as a religious duty. They regard themselves as providing important mechanisms for the organisation of community affairs and the fulfilment of community need.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are relevant to policy-makers and legislators seeking ways of reconciling and accommodating religious beliefs and practice with social norms. In particular, the findings have been used to inform debate on legislation to limit the work of religious tribunals (the Arbitration Services and Mediation(Equality) Bill [HL] 2010-12 and to add to the evidence base concerning the response of the Ministry of Justice to unregistered marriages amongst the Muslim community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AA108CFE-9DC8-47EF-A12C-5E17C81C03C7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-173598425.62451813777ff8d4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.law.cf.ac.uk/clr/research/cohesion.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5278105C-292B-4BD3-B2DD-4009B877B4A3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marriage and Divorce in Religious Courts: A Case Study</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bf40fc3114bfcefcd9b8a065bfeb5008"><gtr:id>bf40fc3114bfcefcd9b8a065bfeb5008</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c0fa6c90a07.16220313</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8262A472-62A6-45C2-918F-F5F6602625AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of religious tribunals in regulating marriage and divorce</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bf40fc3114bfcefcd9b8a065bfeb5008"><gtr:id>bf40fc3114bfcefcd9b8a065bfeb5008</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c0a9de80ec3.31953948</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4157AC15-4098-46BF-BE3C-B0C1341C5A9B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Britain's Religious Tribunals: 'Joint Governance' in Practice</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oxford Journal of Legal Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cecc093fdfacea21cec15744319d1a24"><gtr:id>cecc093fdfacea21cec15744319d1a24</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sandberg R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d047047989bcef</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08F9A325-CA23-4372-A0D3-DCE48E27069E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Managing Family Justice in Diverse Societies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/29f1957ea569ed73e332861c07a5dbcc"><gtr:id>29f1957ea569ed73e332861c07a5dbcc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maclean, Mavis; Eekelaar, John</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-84946-400-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-7341234364.86463453bb87852</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CD44FA17-01D6-4547-8A8F-0071E49D415D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religion and Legal Pluralism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bf40fc3114bfcefcd9b8a065bfeb5008"><gtr:id>bf40fc3114bfcefcd9b8a065bfeb5008</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781409455844</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5638c0d00dfcf7.81629731</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2AED9922-1006-4A7D-A751-CC468665CCFE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Family, Religion and Law: Cultural encounters in Europe</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ba78ce10025b38a188d1c119c2cbd11a"><gtr:id>ba78ce10025b38a188d1c119c2cbd11a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas G et al</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4724-3315-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>541c0d3e1ce367.62756189</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H008896/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>61B990B8-E8CF-4876-B8AE-E00F07CCE8C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Church &amp; Theology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>84FAE587-7A8D-4EE4-9939-EE9AFF202021</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law Regulated By Statute</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
