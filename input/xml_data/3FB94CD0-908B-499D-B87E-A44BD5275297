 &lt;li>Evaluation of natural flood management approaches for Scottish purposes. This is a topic of key contemporary relevance in the debate over future Scottish flood management policy. A review will be undertaken examining theoretical and empirical hydrological studies, flood hazard management approaches, policy objectives of Scottish NGOs and the Scottish Government. Aim: timely submission of a review to contribute to current debate.&lt;br />&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Exploration of the land-water management interface in delivering sustainable flood management. This interface is seen as potentially a key barrier to the achievement of current policy. Structured interviews will be undertaken with government officials with flooding and land management briefs, NGO representatives, representatives of the farming and forestry sectors, SEPA and others. Aim: short article for a professional journal to inform on progress and identify key agendas for resolution.&lt;br />&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Review of barriers to flood risk perception and response in Scotland. There appear to be severe barriers to the uptake of SEPA?s flood preparedness messages. An understanding of attitudes to flood risk is vital to successful operation of flood warning schemes, which continue to benefit from investment funding. International literature, interviews and analysis of Scottish policy documents will be used to produce a policy briefing paper.&lt;/li>

Held just 4 months after a new political administration came into office, it provided an opportunity to present some new thinking and discuss ideas with key practitioners and experts.

The summit provided the opportunity for many issues to raised by participants and identified for further investigation. These included legal, financial and operational questions. These were followed up over a 2-year period leading to the introduction and parliamentary passage of the 2009 Flood Risk Management Bill.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463ebf977be66.73868038</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2007</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant was targeted at experiential learning, whereby the researcher contributed to the work of a devolved government administration and, in the process, gained experience of the needs of policy makers and those responsible for implementing policies. The experience was tremendously valuable in this regard and has contributed to the identification of subsequent policy-relevant research proposals which are now being taken forward.

At the heart of the placement was the issue of natural flood management. Much time was spent researching the evidence for its effectiveness and the possible barriers to its successful implementation. The research evidence pointed decisively towards NFM being effective at small (&amp;lt;5-10 km2) catchment scale but there was a lack of evidence of effectiveness at larger scales. Equally, existing research pointed to much greater effectiveness in small floods compared with larger, rarer events. Barriers to effectiveness focused on land ownership arrangements and financial support mechanisms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings were reported to the Scottish Government and used to help inform the drafting of legislation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B776C445-6DD9-46F7-B062-FD01B118BEA3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54637f36525915.20846059</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-173-27-0042</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-173-27-0042</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
