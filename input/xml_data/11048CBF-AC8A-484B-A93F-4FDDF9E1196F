The atoms in turn have a structure. Almost their complete mass is concentrated in a small core, composed of positively charged particles called protons, and neutral particles called neutrons. The core is surrounded by a cloud of lighter particles, called electrons, which are negatively charged. As far as is known today, the electron is an elementary particle, which cannot be divided any further, and which does not have a sub-structure. The proton, on the other hand, has been found to be made of two types of the elementary particles called quarks. While all matter that surrounds us is composed of these two quarks and the electron, they form only the lightest of three families of such particles. Their heavier siblings are however unstable and can be studied under laboratory conditions only. What is the laboratory needed for this type of study? We need to provide sufficient energy to create these particles and an apparatus to record their behaviour. The energy is provided by large particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider currently under construction at CERN, where protons are collided head-on with nearly the speed of light. The unstable particles exist only for fractions of a second, and therefore have to be studied by recording the products of their decays in a large particle detector. One such detector is the ATLAS experiment built into the LHC. Collisions inside the ATLAS experiment will occur at a rate f up to one billion per second, of which only a few hundred can be recorded for further analysis. The decision if an event should be kept has to be made very fast under these circumstances. The system responsible for this decision is the so-called trigger system, which in the case of ATLAS is composed of three levels. The first part of the research proposed in this project is concerned with the first level of this trigger system, which has the task to select on average one out of 10,000 events in a time of less than about two millionth of a second. I intend to participate in constructing this system and in ensuring its efficient operation especially during the first period of data taking. What questions do I hope to answer with the data thus collected? As mentioned above, the particles in the core of an atom are much heavier than those surrounding the core. The proton in particular, is about 2,000 times heavier than the electron. The question is - why? How do these particles acquire their mass? The currently favoured theory was invented by P Higgs, and states that the mass is generated through the interaction with a field named after him. but how can we be sure? The theory also predicts that a self-interaction of the field will produce a heavy particle - the Higgs particle. The search for the Higgs particle is one of the particle searches that will be carried out with the ATLAS data. Many more particle searches will be performed, however. The LHC is the largest energy collider ever built, so much heavier particles, if they exist, can be produced here. Theoretical models extending our current understanding of the particle families and their interactions predict many more particles to be in the range accessible to the LHC, which promises a very exciting time when the data becomes available. I will participate in the search for these particles. Such particles will extend not only our knowledge of the sub-atomic world, but will help our understanding in the cosmological domain. Astronomical observations show that there must be a much larger amount of matter present in the Universe than can be seen - the so-called dark matter. The composition of this dark matter, however, remains a mystery.
