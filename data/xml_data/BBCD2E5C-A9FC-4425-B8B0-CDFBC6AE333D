Although the symptoms are well managed at the early stages with medication, there is currently no treatment to halt or reverse the progress of PD. In the late 1980s and 1990s several PD patients received transplants of fetal midbrain tissue containing dopamine-producing neurons. A small fraction of patients showed tremendous benefit from such grafts. A multi-centre European clinical trial led by co-applicant Dr. Roger Barker, TRANSEURO, is underway to re-visit fetal midbrain transplants and systematically address all potential problems faced in the earlier clinical trials. These trials will be small due to the limiting amount of fetal tissue available. There will be a pressing need to resolve the critical issues of scaleable supply and quality of appropriate dopaminergic neurons for any future widespread use in the treatment of PD. Replacing fetal midbrain tissue with dopaminergic neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is the most realistic solution to this cell source problem. Currently 5 different centres in the UK (Edinburgh, London, Manchester, Newcastle, and Sheffield) have established clinical-grade hESC lines, over 15 lines in total. This proposal will examine all UK clinical-grade hESC lines and compare them for their ability to make dopaminergic neurons. We will modify and optimise a novel method to transform hESCs to dopaminergic neurons from our collaborator Dr. Lorenz Studer (Sloan-Kettering, NYC). The best performing hESC line will be used for transplantation into two distinct rat models of PD. Graft survival, behavioural improvements, and absence of tumour formation will all be carefully assessed. The success of this project using hESC-derived dopaminergic neurons in pre-clinical rat models of PD will be a significant step towards the first-in-human clinical trials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Transplantation of fetal midbrain tissue to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) has demonstrated proof-of-concept that some patients can benefit from such grafts. An international multi-centre Framework 7 European clinical trial, TRANSEURO, is underway to re-visit fetal midbrain transplants and systematically address all protocol and procedural issues with the earlier clinical trials. There is a pressing need to resolve the critical questions of scaleable supply and quality of appropriate Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade dopaminergic cells for any future widespread use in the treatment of PD. Replacing fetal midbrain tissue with midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is the most realistic solution to the cell source problem. We will modify and optimise a novel method to differentiate hESCs to mDA neurons, which relies on a developmental protocol based on floor plate specification. GMP-grade hESCs from multiple sources throughout the UK will be quantitatively assessed for efficiency of mDA differentiation. The best performing hESC line will be used to establish procedures to produce GMP-capable mDA preparations for transplantation. All experiments will be performed with research-grade reagents that have a suitable GMP-grade equivalent available. The mDA neuronal populations will be transplanted into two nude rat models of PD (i) a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model and (ii) an adeno-associated virus-alpha-synuclein model. Graft survival, behavioural improvements, and absence of tumour formation will be assessed. This collaborative proposal will bring together expertise in pluripotent stem cell differentiation, pre-clinical models of PD, and the UK 's clinical-grade hESCs, with the ultimate aim of moving to first-in-human clinical trials.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that affects 120,000 people in the UK and 6-8 million people world-wide, and this number is expected to increase exponentially with the aging population. The total annual burden of PD in the UK for 2007 was estimated to be &amp;pound;3.3 billion (Findley LJ, 2007), and this economical burden increase substantially with the increase in incidence. This project proposes to establish the foundation to bring a cell-based therapy to the clinic for PD. In the best-case scenario, the impact on the quality of life for sufferers of PD and their carers would be enormous. Although, transplantation of hESC-derived dopaminergic neurons may not provide a true cure due to multiple neural cell types affected in PD, it may provide 15-20 years of drug-free and motor symptom-free relief. Furthermore, combining a transplantation therapy with a disease-modifying drug that prevents alpha-synuclein-mediated neuronal damage may provide a near-complete cure of this condition.
The upfront costs of a transplantation therapy may be large (on par with deep-brain stimulation), but if successful, there will be substantial savings in medication costs and other types of care, including palliative care. The economic savings to the NHS could be very significant indeed.

This is in relation to our recently published paper in Scientific Reports entitled &amp;quot;The molecular karyotype of 25 clinical-grade hESC lines.&amp;quot; 
The podcast went live on 8th December, 2015 and I subsequently received emails from researchers complimenting me on the discussing, including from the Pasteur Institute.

On 24th December, I received an email from Shaun Teacher regarding The Stem Cell Podcast, which he listened to. He works for BioTime, Inc, a California-based company that has the commerical rights for clinical-grade human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines established by Jeremy Crook in Singapore. We are in discussions now about how my academic work and their commercial work can work together to bring these cell lines into industrial us in the United States.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56989e953a8922.61056034</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://stemcellpodcast.com/ep-59-clinical-grade-featuring-dr-tilo-kunath</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>1st Intercontinental Workshop for First Clinical Stem Cell trials for Parkinson's</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>568443CB-D13E-4296-9C6A-10C8B7477EF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This meeting was held in London 4-5 May, 2014. My talk on clinical-grade UK human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for Parkinson's treatment generated substantial discussion, and highlighted the unique position of the UK in bringing this type of therapy to the clinic.

After my talk a new collaboration was started with Dr. Malin Parmar (Lund, Sweden), and we plan to write joint grant applications, and we are also discussing how we mght run the first clinical trial, and whether it is advantageous to have a joint Sweden-UK trial.
The next meeting of this consortium is scheduled for 18-20 May, 2015 in New York.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54627ad9589882.40639469</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gforce-pd.com/gforce-a-new-global-iniatitive-around-stem-cell-based-therapies-for-parkinsons-disease/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dalriada Conversations</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5DF973F2-4128-4063-8A8D-9C1FD599CB1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 25th November 2016, I gave a 40 minute talk on stem cells and potential applications for Parkinson's disease. This was followed by 60min of questions and discussions. Prof Ken Bowler (Edinburgh branch of Parkinson's UK) is one of the co-organisers of Dalriada Conversations and set up the invitation to speak. Nick Stroud, another co-organiser, sent me a card in the post dated 26th November that read &amp;quot;Dear Tilo, Just a wee note to thank you very much for giving up your evening to come and have a chat with us in Portobello. Your work is fascinating, and you have a very engaging way of talking about it. And even though you made it sound really challenging work, right at the frontiers of human knowledge, I think you spared us several layers of just how complicated and minutely detailed this work is! We all appreciated this from a very personal point of view, as well: it's good to know that our dear Ken has so much talent on his side. I'm sorry we kept you from your family, so appreciate your visit even more. And we certainly all wish you the very best with your continuing research. Thank you!! Nick Stroud&amp;quot; 

At the end of the discussions I met the mother of researcher at UCL that has recently spun out a company that works on molecules that may have therapeutic potental for Parkinson's. I gave the woman my contact details, and asked for he daughter to get in contact with me.

On 8th December, 2015 I received an email from Dr Jemma Gatliff introducing herself as the daughter of the woman I meet at Dalriada Conversations on 25th November. She is the CEO and co-founder of Keregen Therapeutics, a spin-out compnay of UCL that has developed small molecule activators of NRF2, a transcription factor that activates antioxidant defense pathways. Her company is a OneStart 2015 finalist for Europe, which picks the top 10 start-up companies in the life sciences and healthcare sector for that year.
Dr Gatliff and I had our first in-person meeting on 28th December, 2015 at our institute MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, to share our respective knowledge and data. We also discussed how we could work together and options for potential funding. The next meeting be in her labs in London.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>569899c945d766.33583626</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Roslin Institute Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43C0BAF8-EB34-47D8-9AD9-DD351AA84276</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a seminar of my current research to 50-60 basic and veterinary scientists on 20th November, 2013 at The Roslin Institute.
