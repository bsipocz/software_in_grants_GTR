JWST is being built and operated as a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency. With a cost of approximately $10 billion, JWST is amongst the most expensive scientific projects ever undertaken. 

JWST is truly a multi-purpose observatory and will, by providing 10-100 times improvement in sensitivity at near-IR wavelengths revolutionise our understanding of the Universe. This will range the study of our own Solar System to the earliest galaxies in the Universe.

The UK is involved through its membership of ESA though has directly contributed to the development and testing Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). A small number (~30) of scientists are involved in projects with Guaranteed Time Observations, though it is expected that a much larger number of UK scientists will be involved in scientific exploitation over the missions 5-10 year anticipated lifetime. 

The scale of JWST in terms of committed resources, the UK's large contribution, and impact on UK and global astronomy more than justifies the need to build a comprehensive, wide reaching, and engaging education, public engagement, and outreach (EPO) programme. Indeed, as the world's premier observatory, JWST has the potential to inspire a new generation into not only astronomy but a range of STEM disciplines in much the same way Hubble did previously. 

Due to the diversity of the science themes that will be tackled by JWST, building such a comprehensive, wide reaching, and engaging EPO programme presents a huge challenge requiring the expertise of engineers, scientists across the science themes, and EPO professionals. 

The principle aim of this programme is to support and enhance JWST EPO activities in the build up to the launch and in the immediate ~2 years following. The fellowship will have a specific focus, albeit not exclusively, on two areas:

- Developing resources (both online and physical) around the two science themes (First Light and Reionisation, and Assembly of Galaxies) relevant to my research.
- Developing and deploying resources (again, both online and physical) aimed at younger audiences.

This will be achieved through a combination of different activities including:

- Contribution to JWST UK's online presence including the development of content aimed at younger audiences and research posts.
- Development and delivery of a flexible JWST exhibit for use in schools and public events.
- In partnership with science centres the development of fixed JWST exhibits.
- In partnership with science centres and other institutions the curation of a series of events celebrating the launch of JWST (launch parties).

An ancillary goal of this fellowship is to expand the range of local events to encompass low science capital communities and better promote STEM events across Sussex.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108165</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R001243/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
