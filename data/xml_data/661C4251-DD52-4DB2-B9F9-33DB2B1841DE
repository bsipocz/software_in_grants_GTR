Proteins form a complex 3-dimensional structure that frequently determines their function. A protein's function is usually dependent on interaction with another molecule and this interaction leads to an effect. The experiments described in this proposal aim to investigate the structure and function of a protein from pathogenic bacteria that is able to change the properties of the host cell during infection. Specifically this protein, called 'Cif' interferes with progression of the host cell cycle (process of growth and division), irreversibly stopping it in its tracks. Although it is not currently understood why, this presumably has some benefit for the invading bacteria. Studying proteins such as this is important for both understanding host-pathogen interactions (the molecular causes of disease) and the host cell processes themselves. For instance, a deregulated cell cycle is often linked to development of cancer, and proteins that regulate the cell cycle are one of the most targeted set of molecules by the pharmaceutical industry. How Cif actually brings about its effect in host cells is not currently understood. One powerful approach to determining how this protein functions is to look at its structure. This can be visualised using a technique called X-ray crystallography followed by reconstruction of a model using computer graphics. Once the structure is known alterations to the protein can be designed to further investigate protein function in host cells. Also important for understanding Cif function is identifying the protein's molecular targets within host cells (most likely other proteins), characterising the interaction (how strongly do they bind to each other?), and ultimately determining the structure of molecules together. This would generate a picture of a bacterial protein interacting with a host cell protein, and a complex responsible for transducing an effect ultimately leading to host cell cycle arrest. Understanding the nature of these interactions for Cif has long-term applications for development of novel therapeutics targeting host-pathogen interactions and also carcinogenesis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cif (cycle inhibiting factor) is a type 3 secretion dependent 'cyclomodulin' protein initially identified in the food-borne pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Translocation of Cif by these bacteria into model host cells induces a cytopathic effect characterised by irreversible cell cycle arrest and formation of actin stress fibres (an identical effect is also observed using an artificial lipid-based protein delivery system in the absence of bacteria). Cell cycle arrest by Cif is not achieved by activation of the DNA damage pathway but by a novel, as yet uncharacterised mechanism. To determine this mechanism of action, protein structures for members of the Cif family are urgently required, as is information on the complexes formed by Cifs in host cells that are mediating effects. To this end, building on preliminary data, the crystal structure of Cifs from EPEC and Burkholderia pseudomallei will be determined. These structures will be analysed in the context of identifying protein function. From the structures, site directed mutagenesis studies will be designed to probe function as assayed by the established lipid-based protein delivery system (plus any in vitro assay appropriate). Complexes between Cifs and target host proteins already identified in a yeast two hybrid screen will be investigated using appropriate thermodynamic and hydrodynamic techniques in solution. Complexes that form stable interactions will be the subject of structure determination by the complementary techniques of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and X-ray crystallography. Interacting surfaces will be probed by site directed mutagenesis to understand their role in protein function. These studies are designed to probe the function of a bacterially derived modulator of the eukaryotic cell cycle, with implications in understanding host-pathogen interactions and in the longer term identifying novel therapeutic targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>423482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse (INP Toulouse)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Lab in Toulouse</gtr:description><gtr:id>04AEB15B-1C26-4176-A224-19546D5FCF1A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b960847ab960848e-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>We collaborated extensively with a Lab in Toulouse on the in vivo aspects of the work associated with the grant.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar at University of Queensland, Australia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>920A492D-DCDE-4EBC-A6CF-1F3692C8FB31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar delivered during visit to the University of Queensland, Australia describing the work conducted during this grant.

Specifically, Cifs interfere with host cell cycle progression (the process of cell growth and division). This activity presumably benefits the pathogen, perhaps by increasing the longevity of epithelial cells at the sites of infection. At the beginning of this work, we were already aware of a potential target of Cif activity in host cells (at least for one family member), the small ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8, but did not understand how Cif interacted with this protein and modified its action or what the link was between Nedd8 modification and host cell cycle progression. 



Funded by the BBSRC, we set out to understand the activity of the Cif family of proteins using a structure/function approach, including investigating what the outcome of the Cif/Nedd8 interaction was and the details of the molecular interface that enables this. We had 4 main aims in the project. The first was to determine crystal structures of Cif proteins to gain insight into their function: we determined the structure of 3 sequence-divergent members of this protein family. A fourth was determined by another group, enabling comparison. These studies confirmed that the Cif protein structure was conserved between species. Secondly, we investigated what happened when we changed particular amino acid residues in the protein: we generated &amp;gt; 10 changes to the Cif from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the effects of which were assayed as below. Thirdly, using the altered proteins generated above and both in vitro and in vivo assays we investigated the interaction of Cifs with Nedd8. Finally, we determined the structure of the complexes formed between 2 different Cifs and Nedd8, providing a high-resolution picture of the interface between a pathogen protein and its host cell target. 



During the course of this grant another group identified that the activity of Cif on Nedd8 was to catalyse the deamidation of a glutamine amino side chain (Gln40), converting it to a glutamate. This activity was correlated with retention of Nedd8 conjugation on Cullin-RING ligases in cells, resulting in stabilization of key cell cycle regulators. This explained the cell-cycle arrest phenotype of Cifs. Significantly, our BBSRC-funded work supports and extends this analysis. Our structures place the Gln40 side chain of Nedd8 in the Cif active site and reveal how these proteins have evolved to recognize their substrate. Through our mutational analysis we have validated the structures and investigated the mechanism of catalysis, showing that residues distant from the active site can prevent complex formation and can prevent enzyme activity. 



Finally, our studies (combined with those of others) have established the molecular basis of Cif activity. These studies pave the way for using these molecules to further our understanding of the role of Nedd8 (and ubiquitin) in host cell processes, not only related to pathogenesis but also other systems that rely on control of the cell cycle, including carcinogenesis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This award pre-dates the need to submit a pathways to impact
