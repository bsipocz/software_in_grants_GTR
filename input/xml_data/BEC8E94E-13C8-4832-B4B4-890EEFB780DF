We have adapted the questionnaire on teachers' practices in maths education, with minimal adaptation, in order to use it to build a picture of current practice in science classrooms from the point of view of the science teacher. We asked teachers to rate possible elements of their practice in relation to different KS3 year groups (years 7, 8, 9). Our intention is to use this with teachers at various stages in their careers as part of a project investigating current practice and the rationale for it, along with associated challenges and tensions. 

So far we have piloted the questionnaire with 60 PGCE science trainees at a point halfway through their initial teacher education year, and we are currently analysing the results.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have supported through the provision of the teachers and student questionnaires their instrument development.

The research, in brief, has raised awareness of the complexity of this relationship and confirmed that traditional, teaching-to-the-test approaches turn off students from maths. 
Our main impacts have been and will continue to be disseminated at national (e.g. BERA, BSRLM) and international educational and methodological (e.g. ECER, PME, ECM) conferences, and relevant journal papers are being developed from these. Conclusions from preliminary findings of the project have reached the national news after a press release during BERA 2012 conference. 
The validated instruments from this work have already been used for an MEI evaluation study, are currently being developed further for use within new studies (e.g. EEF ICAMMS evaluation) and are included as tools in ongoing (ERC, ERSC and Nuffield) research proposals. This work, has also created opportunities for networking and collaboration with colleagues nationally and internationally; some of these collaborations have already come to fruition (e.g. use of the pedagogical instruments in an intervention study sponsored by London Schools Excellence Fund, use of the adapted maths attitudes instruments with parents in a local school aiming to improve learning outcomes).
We have also contributed with school reports and presentations to practitioners (e.g. teachers) and relevant policy makers. The partner schools were invited to the Maths and Sciences Teachers Conference (University of Manchester, June 2014) where we also disseminated some of the project's findings as part of the information fair, through briefings developed for teachers (accessible on our website). We also presented some relevant results under a session titled &amp;quot;Ethnicity and Inequalities in Education&amp;quot; at Policy week 2014 (organised by the University of Manchester) an event widely attended by various stakeholders. The project's impact had also reached Parliament as evidenced by an invitation to present the findings issued by the then minister Truss. 
However, further outputs are also in preparation, including several journal articles and a book chapter. We aim to continue dissemination and website updates to reach higher impact. The resulting datasets have only recently been archived and we have already been contacted by a colleague interested in using this research resource to investigate post-secondary outcomes (e.g. nurses' numeracy confidence/skills), which indicates a promising impact potential.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>69AA703A-A213-4552-AF30-605767014203</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55cce7f7dbf875.85024517</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The study aimed to map secondary students' learning outcomes and choices including dispositions and attitudes together with the teaching they are exposed to. The project was designed to capture the five years of students' progression in Secondary Education (Year 7 to 11) in about one year of data collection (from 10/2011 to 12/2012). The most significant achievements from the grant so far are listed below:
- We collected data from longitudinal surveys with students in 40 Secondary Schools about their attitudes to mathematics, confidence at various mathematical topics, future aspirations, and their perceptions of the teaching they encounter. The latter was also captured through a survey administered to their mathematics teachers. Our aim was to match these datasets, along with extra information provided by the schools (e.g. schools attainment) and the National Pupil Database. This has been achieved, but as expected with such designs we had missing data in various patterns, as well as a huge challenge in maintaining linkage in the datasets, which we initially underestimated in regards to time. Despite the challenges, however, we have achieved a new rich dataset of more than 13000 students in about 660 classes in 40 schools, and a linked teacher-class level dataset (from over 130 teachers). This sample is comparable to the national picture in regards to main descriptors such as free school meals, ethnicity and language, but differs in female students' concentration. In addition we have also conducted 2 intensive case studies with observations and interviews. Thus we also have 170 transcripts from interviews from over 100 students and their teachers.
- We designed and validated various instruments. In particular, our instrument capturing students' mathematics attitudes was found to be two-dimensional, capturing 'mathematics dispositions' and 'mathematics identity'. In regards to measuring perceptions of teaching practices, our analysis confirmed a second dimension, of what we call 'teaching variation', in addition to our previously established 'transmissionist' teaching. This finding applies to both students' as well as their teachers' reported perceptions. Additional validated measures include students' perception of parental support, and mathematics self-efficacy. For the latter, we have gone beyond our intended aims and also associated with actual students' scores on an equivalent test administered in one school. 
- Our (multilevel) statistical modelling found evidence of an association between students' declining mathematics dispositions and their perception of the teaching they received (transmissionist teaching was found to negatively affect dispositions, whereas more variation in teaching is positively associated). We also found significant gender and ethnicity effects. It should also be noted that class and school effects account for a significant proportion of the variance in maths dispositions.
- We also addressed the challenge of linking the 5 different year group cohorts of this accelerated longitudinal design with multilevel growth curve models which capture the progression of students' (dropping) dispositions, at least from Year 7 till the start of Year 11. 
Off course the wealth of this dataset along with the involved challenges gave rise to new applications and questions we are currently exploring.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The new understandings of how mathematics pedagogy relates to learner engagement and hence outcomes should be important to both mathematics education practitioners and researcher, and policy and practice. In fact, our preliminary findings have also been picked up by the media, and we have already contributed to policy debates based on our findings. Our instruments have already been used by other researchers for other studies. There are definitely more to come regarding policy implications, teaching practices as well as research innovations. We are already in touch with colleagues across the globe for potential duplication or comparative work based on this study.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F85323F5-ED08-48CE-82D0-D6853D6A73B2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>547b74ac8061d4.69283412</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.teleprism.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This involves some work in progress, partly funded by some internal funding from the University of Manchester, which allowed us to develop our theoretical work on dynamical models.

The student-level dataset includes data from longitudinal surveys (3 time points) with students in 40 Secondary Schools about their attitudes to mathematics, confidence at various mathematical topics, future aspirations, and their perceptions of the teaching they encounter. It is presented in the 'long format', thus it contains more than 30000 cases, which consist of repeated measurements (maximum 3) of more than 13000 students in years 7 to 11. Unique ids are included for students, their classes, and their teachers in order to allow the linkage of this dataset with the other three datasets. 
The Teacher-class level dataset includes the data collected from the teachers' surveys for each of the classes they teach separately, and for each of the two timepoints they were asked to complete the survey (in order to link with students' dataset). It mainly consists of the teachers' responses to questions about their teaching practices with each of these classes at different time points in the academic year 2011-2012 (the timing of completion is also recorded).
The teacher-level dataset includes background information (e.g. gender, ethnicity, age, teaching experience, qualifications) for each of the teacher (130+) who responded in the survey.
The class-level dataset includes the information provided by the teacher about some class characteristics (e.g. set, mixed ability, etc) when available.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F02534EF-37F6-4CD1-A7C7-0A72B5C8C883</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The datasets are the main tools that gave rise to all the results and impact we report on other sections of the outcomes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5481a94d49c176.09898682</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Quantitative Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We conducted more than 170 interviews with over 100 students and their teachers in two schools.
