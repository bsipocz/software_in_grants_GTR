LIGO-India</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/R001928/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>With the first direct observation of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes by the LIGO Scientific collaboration last year there has been great interest around the world in extending the reach of the future detector network, as gravitational wave astronomy breaks open a new window on the Universe. With the siting of the 3rd aLIGO detector in India there is an essential need for critically skilled students, postdocs and early career researchers to be trained at the highest level in gravitational wave astronomy, for construction of the infrastructure &amp;amp; technology, development of high performance computing/machine learning algorithms and efficient data pipelines. In turn, the LIGO India project will help Indian scientific community to be a major player in the emerging research frontier of GW astronomy. Based on the model of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, there is a huge potential for inclusive growth across many areas of industry, academia and society. The UK consortia also have a strong track record of outreach &amp;amp; public engagement, which will be shared with our Indian collaborators. 

The Indian partners will be those institutions jointly coordinating and executing the LIGO-India project and their associates: the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, the Indian Institute for Science Education &amp;amp; Research (IISER) and the TIFR Center for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Hyderabad. Over the coarse of the project we will also develop linkages with the Department of Atomic Energy organisations: Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), Gandhinagar and the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore who will be leading the development of infrastructure (laser, vacuumm system, suspensions and seismic isolation).

The main objectives of this proposal are to build up technical capacity and capability in India in a broad range of multidisciplinary fields associated with gravitational wave detection. This field is very wide in nature and the technologies required range from delicate mechanical instrumentation, through high and low power laser optics to signal processing and large data handling, and thus capacity built up from the work of this proposal will have wide application in other fields. We have already identified several UK-India comapny linkages in the areas of machine learning, sensors &amp;amp; autonomous systems &amp;amp; data algorithms, and we propose to share our experience of methods to spin-out high technology research into applied fields.

The consortium behind this proposal in the UK - the Universities of the West of Scotland, Glasgow, Cardiff, Birmingham, Southampton, and Sheffield - has a strong and extensive track record in detector development, data analysis and background theory and astrophysics for the gravitational wave field, as well as working with industry, in public outreach and school teacher CPD. Thus it is ideally suited to provide training for PhD students, research assistants and early career researchers in the ODA country of India to build capacity and make these countries major contributors to the international community and to provide dedicated summer schools/workshops in the UK utilising the expansive UK training network, for training the incoming members from the ODA countries in the necessary data analysis and experimental hardware techniques. Further the consortium will arrange opportunities for researchers to travel to/from India and the UK to capacity build and perform on-site training of researchers. 

Such a model has already shown to be extremely valuable in the transfer of UK expertise to both the US during the construction of Advanced LIGO and in Japan, during the construction of KAGRA.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this grant will be aligned to the three main objectives;

1. to build up technical capacity and capability in India across a broad range of research disciplines relating to the detection of gravitational waves. The proposed training network will provide specialist, multidisciplinary skills training necessary for scientific community in India to design, construct and run major research infrastructures in the form of gravitational wave detectors. This field is very wide in nature and the technologies required range from delicate mechanical instrumentation, through high and low power laser optics to signal processing and large data handling, and thus capacity built up from the work of this proposal will have wide application in India. There will also be great benefit to the UK consortium groups involved by having highly motivated and innovative visiting postdocs and graduate students contributing to both the depth and the volume of our gravitational wave research. The two-way excahnge will be a powerful method to build capacity and develop long lasting relationships, with potential for future upgardes to enable LIGO India to be the most advanced of the international detectors. 

2. to build a strong base of entrepreneurial activity. The consortium behind this proposal has a strong and extensive track record in working with industry and in taking research from the gravitational wave community and spinning it out in applied fields. Beneficiaries of the work will include 1. optics/laser industries such as Gooch and Housego/Helia Photonics/Optos/Gas Sensing Solutions/Honeywell/Safran/Planys Technologies and 2. data analysis/machine learning/algorithmic sectors including Persistent Systems Limited/Hindustan Aeronautics Limited/UUrmi/Nex Robotics. We anticipate some of our research spin-offs such as nanokicking, MEMS gravimeters and data analysis algorithms being of particular interest to our visiting scientists. More globally, as a spin-off from the Gravitational Waves work at Cardiff, a Data Innovation Institute has been established to conduct fundamental research into the aspects of managing, analysing and interpreting massive volumes of textual and numerical information with applications in the social, biological and engineering sciences, and experience of this by some of our visitors can be carried back to their home countries for potential implementation there in the future.

3 strengthen public outreach and school teacher CPD within India, by co-developing resources which can be used and tested in India, ultimately leading to equitable and quality education. There will also be great benefit to the UK consortium groups involved by having highly motivated and innovative visiting postdocs and graduate students contributing to both the depth and the volume of our gravitational wave research. The discovery of gravitational waves has led to a large increase in public outreach in the UK with many talks being given across the country every week. Feedback from these - often monitored by questionnaire - suggests that this activity coupled with schoolteacher CPD (in the form of videos, dedicated downloads etc) is very valuable to the effort to increase interest in STEM education across the country, and is again very portable by our visitors back to their home countries. Our outreach and impact activities are proving very effective for the training of our graduate students and early career researchers, as measured by their ever improving communication skills and industrial awareness, and we believe in this area we are ideally suited to help transfer these activities to India through the programme proposed in this application.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304759</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R001928/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A50650F5-D901-49C3-AA30-F625AC696676</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle Astrophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4375685C-F12B-449B-BC75-C6052FD877DC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gravitational Waves</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
