Current prototypes employ quantum uncertainty and randomness for security, and next-generation technologies may well use the even weirder and counter-intuitive feature of entanglement. Information security is absolutely essential everywhere today - for individuals, institutions, businesses, governments and nations. Current secure communications systems have some vulnerabilities, some at risk now and others that may be exposed in the future, as computing power and hacking techniques improve. Secure communications based on quantum physics can eliminate some of these vulnerabilities, providing systems whose security is underpinned by the laws of Nature, for example providing for the secure distribution of cryptographic keys.

Through EPSRC, the UK government is investing heavily in development across a spectrum of new quantum technologies, of which communications form a part. The Quantum Communications Hub is funded to develop current quantum key distribution (QKD) prototypes through to commercial readiness and to turn next-generation quantum communications demonstrations into prototype technologies. The aim is:
- to develop short-range, low cost QKD for mobile devices such as 'phones;
- to develop chip-scale QKD modules, for ease of manufacture and widespread and versatile deployment; 
- to investigate new directions in quantum communications, going beyond simple QKD, for example to quantum versions of digital signatures for signing electronic messages or documents;
- to demonstrate QKD over networks and its integration with conventional communications.

The new project UKQNtel builds on the last of these directions. It will connect BT Research and the major ICT and telecommunications cluster at Adastral Park, Martlesham, to the UK Quantum Network (UKQN) being built by the Quantum Communications Hub. This will enable new and direct collaborations between companies at Adastral Park and the Hub partners, accelerating innovation. It will offer QKD and trial quantum-encrypted data services to a large cluster of companies in the very important telecommunications sector. It will enable major Showcase and Demonstration events for quantum technologies, utilizing the outstanding facilities at Adastral Park.

There is great potential for the UK to become a world-leader in the new quantum communications technologies and services arena - for individuals, institutions, businesses and government. In addition to the development of the technologies, it is vital to engage early across the whole spectrum of end-users, to generate &amp;quot;market pull&amp;quot;. UKQNtel will crucially enable this early user engagement for the telecommunications and large business sector at Adastral Park. This will complement the consumer engagement in Bristol and the SME engagement on Cambridge Science Park already being pursued by the Quantum Communications Hub. Putting all this together will address user engagement for the whole spectrum of future markets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impacts of the UKQNtel capital equipment project all derive from the implications of connecting the Adastral Park telecoms cluster and its resources and facilities to the rest of the UK Quantum Network, which is being built by the Quantum Communications Hub. The impacts generated from UKQNtel will be monitored by the Network Access Group (NAG) that manage it, and reported to the Hub Advisory Board (the membership of which includes substantial commercial experience) to ensure coherence and optimisation of both the impacts and exploitation.

Three main pathways to impact are identified; for each the beneficiaries and the benefits are summarised.

1. Access to expertise and resources in BT Labs:
- Researchers in major R&amp;amp;D centres in industry and universities will benefit from new collaborations over the extended UKQN. A specific example is the connection of BT's applied research Labs to those of Toshiba in Cambridge and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). These three centres have collaboration track record; the direct connection of UKQNtel would enable new work on timing and synchronisation over fibre, in which all have R&amp;amp;D interests directed at commercial exploitation. 
- Engineers in major R&amp;amp;D centres in industry and universities will benefit from direct collaboration with BT labs on a range of applied work, including product development. 
- Companies connected to the UKQN (e.g. on Cambridge Science Park) - with products, processes or services that would benefit from collaboration with BT - will be able to exploit UKQNtel for this purpose. 

2. Access to pilot QKD and secured data services for companies on Adastral Park: 
These companies will benefit from:
- shared multiple access in single buildings, enabling collaborative trials and experiments with quantum secure services. This will stimulate ideas for new services and applications that exploit quantum networking.
- dedicated access for specific companies for fixed periods, in order to work on specific projects.
 
3. UKQN and QKD technology developments in BT's Showcase and Demonstration facilities: 
These Showcase facilities are a major resource and currently host over 50,000 visitors a year, with a focus on key business areas for BT: Government; Banking and Finance, National Services (especially Health), and Network Service providers - all targets as early adopters of, and customers for, quantum secure services. Specific benefits from UKQNtel access to these facilities are:
- provision of real-time demonstrations to large audiences and to a wide range of interested parties.
- a shop window for a range of novel quantum communications technologies, such as short range, free space, systems and next generation protocols such as digital signatures, and the services that these can support. 
- targeted events and engagement for the local cluster of companies; those in the wider region, nationally and even internationally; key sectors, including those identified as early adopters (e.g. Communications, Network Security, Finance, and Health).

All of these identified impacts will contribute to building &amp;quot;market pull&amp;quot; in a range of sectors. This is crucial for the emergence of new quantum communications technology and service companies, and thus of longer term benefit to the UK economy, in terms of both wealth and hi-tech job creation.


UKQNtel will also deliver major impact from an academic perspective, as detailed in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2049030</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N015207/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
