This proposal concerns an 18-month experimental study into the application of surface plasma actuators as an active boundary layer and wake control technique with the aim of reducing the drag and Trailing Edge self-noise of aerofoil. Two configurations will be investigated: (1) an aerofoil with blunt trailing edge - which characteristically combines a superior lift performance with high drag and significant tone noise radiation; (2) an aerofoil with a sharp trailing edge - which typically produces broadband self-noise in high Reynolds number flow. The main technology under investigation here is the relatively new, though rapidly expanding, surface plasma actuators. The usage of surface plasma actuators for flow control is very attractive for industrial applications because this technique is highly energy efficient, has a fast response, a simple structure, can be used for both steady and unsteady actuations and creates no profile drag when not in operation. The proposed research aims to simultaneously optimise the aerodynamical and aeroacoustical performances of aerofoil with blunt as well as sharp trailing edges. The expected outcome of this research is an extensive validation of the effectiveness of surface plasma actuator as a relatively novel technique for the reduction of drag and noise generated by aircraft components such as the turbofan engine and airframe. The outcome of this research is also transferable to the wind turbine industry and fan-based home appliance sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>An active flow control method (Dielectric surface plasma) is proposed to reduce both the base-drag and trailing edge self-noise of aerofoils. The impact of this research to the academic circle, industrial sector, general public and governmental policy makers is significant. The academic impact has already been addressed in the &amp;quot;Academic beneficiaries&amp;quot; section. How this proposal can benefit the industrial sector, general public and governmental policy makers is detailed below:
It is envisaged that this research project can directly affect three types of industries: aerospace, wind turbine and fan-based home appliance manufacturers. For the aerospace industry, research and development into the &amp;quot;faster, higher and longer&amp;quot; technologies has reached a saturation phase where great emphasise is now placed on developing technology to sustain the above accomplishments with the lowest possible energy consumption and cost. The active flow control technology developed in this research can reduce the viscous or pressure drag caused by the turbulent or separated flows over the aircraft body or lifting surfaces, thus saving fuel, and consequently reducing the overall operational cost. The novelty of this research project, however, is to exploit the by-product as a result of the active flow control on drag reduction. This &amp;quot;by-product&amp;quot; is essentially the reduction of the noise sources on the foil surfaces and in the wake flow. Therefore, this research aims to reduce the drag force and self-noise radiation simultaneously. Nowadays, aerofoil self-noises generated by the aircraft fan engine, the airframe and the wind turbine (which has a characteristic swishing noise that can be heard at considerable distance) can affect the quality of life, and in some cases, personal health of the general public who reside near the airport or wind farm. These noise issues have already hampered the growths of airport capacity and onshore wind turbine installation significantly. The European Union and the UK government have two ambitious targets to be achieved by the year 2020. The first one originates from the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe, where a target was set to reduce the perceived aviation noise to one half of the year 2001 level by 2020. The second one is the UK government's commitment to increase the share of renewable energy in the domestic usage to 15% by 2020. In 2011, the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change identified that extra wind power delivered by both onshore and offshore wind turbines is required to meet this 15% target. The proposed research will benefit directly aircraft and engine manufacturers seeking to design quieter aero-engines by establishing new control techniques for reducing the noise from rotor blades and aircraft wings, and wind turbine manufactures who aim to design the next generation turbine blades with low-noise and low-drag characteristics. This work will clearly benefit communities living in close proximity to airports or wind farms. Most importantly, technology developed in this work will have a direct beneficial impact on Europe and UK's efforts to achieve the two targets identified above, which ultimately can improve not only the quality of life for the general public, but also the economy of the country as a whole. The quest for the improvement of &amp;quot;quality of life&amp;quot; by the proposed research can also be extended to the general consumer of home appliances. An innovative electronic manufacturer is interested to adopt the fan noise control methodology to be developed in this research to their fan-based home appliance products, such as the air-conditioner, to produce a quiet operating condition. To summarise the impact of this research proposal, the technology developed here will appeal to a wide spectrum of industrial products ranging from large aircraft engine fans and wind turbine blades to small air-conditioner fans.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97827</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Next generation aerofoil by hybrid active and passive flow controls</gtr:description><gtr:id>31D2DE11-5111-4005-A128-52F2A305E72D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Oksana Stalnov and I have achieved some preliminary results on the hybrid leading edge serration and plasma actuator on the reduction of aerofoil turbulence-leading edge interaction noise.

The open days in Brunel provide a good opportunity to inform the general public about the innovative research conducted in the area of aircraft noise reduction. I have the opportunity to demonstrate the plasma actuators that could be used for aircraft engine fan noise reduction, which generates interests among the visitors and encourages more students to engage in the STEM education. 

Given the close proximity of Brunel University to Heathrow Airport and the noise-sensitive areas that are under the flight paths, my research on the plasma actuators (EP/K002309/1) and serration technology (EP/N018737/1) that aims to reduce fan noise radiated from the aircraft engine has a high potential to achieve significant social impact. This is because a lot of these visitors are from the local area who are genuinely concerned about the impact of the aviation noise and are interested to know more about the recent trend in the technological development. My EPSRC-funded research is well placed to demonstrate that the academic research community as well as the government are motivated to continuously develop the latest technology to address this important societal issue.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df5ec55a4ae2.54960128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2014,2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Brunel University Seed and Pump Priming Funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Brunel University London</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>FAA204 (internal Brunel code)</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>F113A442-B5D3-432C-B1EC-B193B3D80858</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df5515830438.20991608</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the Government has committed to significant year-on-year greenhouse gas cuts towards an 80% reduction (from the 1990 baseline) by 2050. At a time of heightened sensitivity regarding the economic cost of government policies, the technological maturity of wind power is an attractive option. Onshore wind capacity is set to double by 2020, with offshore set for a four-fold rise, which will result in increased pressure to find suitable onshore and offshore sites. The drive for greater energy yield and technological developments are producing turbines of increasing size that are more likely to result in intrusive low-frequency noise. It is highly likely that in future the UK will see higher numbers of larger turbines affecting increasing numbers of neighbouring residents. Wind turbine noise is a high concern for communities, resulting in planning obstruction and operational complaints. 

The new technology of plasma actuator developed in this EPSRC project will address this issue, by seeking to preserve the quality of life for nearby residents of existing and proposed wind turbine developments, and helping to ensure that the politics of wind turbines does not impede the critical issue of developing more sustainable means of energy generation. In 2014, the Energy Scientific Advisory Committee ranks wind power technology of high importance due to current wind power deployment plans and the substantial UK wind resource (the best in Europe). The target of increasing public acceptability of wind power technology is an urgent requirement.

This EPSRC project concerns an experimental study into the application of surface plasma actuators as an active boundary layer and wake control technique to reduce the trailing edge self-noise of aerofoil. An in-house plasma system has been developed well within the set deadline. The experiment was performed in the state-of-the-art aeroacoustic wind tunnel at Brunel University (designed by the PI). Using the plasma system, this project aims to: (1) suppress wake vortex shedding produced by a blunt trailing edge, thereby reducing tonal noise; and (2) suppress boundary layer turbulence level on a sharp trailing edge, thereby reducing broadband noise. These objectives have been met at the conclusion of this project.

Some of these results have been disseminated to international and national conferences and workshops. Presenting the results in these events has exerted considerable impact because the forums will normally attended by the best scientist, engineers, industrialists and academics. The result is currently being documented in two high impact journals: AIAA Journal and Journal of Sound and Vibration. The accepted manuscripts will be made open access for dissemination to a wider audience, including the general public.

The Mechanical Engineering subject area of Brunel University offers its course with an optional Monitored Professional Development Scheme (MPDS). Students who choose the &amp;quot;with MPDS&amp;quot; courses will secure a 1-year industrial placement with companies including the GE Aviation, Rolls Royce, DSTL and QinetiQ. The PI, being the Industrial Placement Officer at his department, has the opportunity to visit these companies. The visits offered the PI opportunities to communicate his research activities, including this EPSRC project, to relevant industrial beneficiaries, expand his network of collaboration and pursue further work in the area as well as the commercialisation of the project outcomes.

The university open days offer another opportunity in which the PI can inform the general public about the innovative research conducted in the area of aerofoil self-noise reduction by plasma flow control, and raise public awareness regarding the impact of aircraft noise on the airport capacity and UK economy, and most importantly to provide information on the most up to date research efforts in reducing the aircraft noise. Given the close proximity of Brunel University to Heathrow Airport and the noise-sensitive areas that are under the flight paths, the PI has the potential to interact with many members of local public who are genuinely concerned about the aviation noise.

The project has successfully demonstrated that tonal noise generated by the blunt trailing edge can be completely suppressed by the plasma actuators where noise reduction up to 20 dB is achieved. Based on the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data, the mechanisms were attributed to the plasma jet that (1) acts as the &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; splitter barrier to inhibit the momentum transfer between the upper and lower sides of the wake flow; and (2) reduces the velocity deficit at the near wake region. 
A new &amp;quot;hybrid&amp;quot; approach has also been developed during the course of the project to combine plasma actuator (active control) and non-flat plate serration geometry (passive control) together. The latter is inspired by owl's wing through profiling the trailing edge of an aerofoil in a serrated pattern. However, it is different with the conventional flat plate type because the serration pattern is cut directly into the aerofoil body. The plasma actuators are then applied at the vicinity of the exposed blunt roots to suppress the vortex shedding in the near wake. Our experimental data at low Reynolds number has demonstrated that this hybrid control method is effective in reducing the turbulent broadband noise radiated at the trailing edge (noise reduction up to 7 dB), but crucially avoids unwanted vortex shedding noise and maintains the aerodynamic performance and structural integrity of the aerofoil. 
In conclusion, the successful demonstration of reductions in the tonal noise (radiated from the blunt trailing edge) and turbulent broadband noise by the plasma actuators developed in this EPSRC-funded project shows that the original objectives have been achieved. 
When an aerofoil encounters gusty wind, high level of freestream turbulence impinges on the aerofoil's leading edge. This interaction is extremely effective in radiating broadband noise with a sound pressure level significantly higher than the trailing edge self-noise. So far the only mitigating technology is to use leading edge tubercles. Some successes in noise reduction have been demonstrated by this passive method, but the degradation in the aerodynamic performance (increase in drag and reduce in lift) implies that it is still not matured yet to be implemented in the industry. This particular issue was not part of this original EPSRC proposal, but it represents an avenue for further research of the plasma actuator because it offers the benefits of light weight, controllable actuations and most importantly no extra profile drag will be inadvertently produced. It is envisaged that the plasma actuator can be a better solution for the reduction of turbulence-leading edge interaction noise.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The plasma system developed in this ESPRC project is based on aerofoil operating in a relatively uniform smooth flow where trailing edge self-noise is the dominant noise generation mechanism. The plasma system can easily be extended to aerofoil subjected to gusty flow, thus making it effective in suppressing the leading edge-gust interaction noise. The technology developed in this EPSRC project could be further developed, and the areas where the plasma system is likely to have most impact are on aero engines, wind turbine, Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC), open rotor aircraft, power generation gas turbine and cooling fan of home appliances including personal computer. 

These high tech manufacturers are naturally conservative and new technology is adopted only after very extensive testing and in-depth studies are undertake of the economic in terms of balancing the advantages of noise reductions against the manufacturing costs, maintenance costs, safety, and any possible degradation in aerodynamic performance. Some of these companies, such as the wind turbine companies are more likely to introduce trailing edge serration and/or leading edge tubercles in the short term as these can be retro-fitted onto existing wind turbine blades and easily removed should problems arise. The adoption by these companies of the plasma actuators developed in this EPSRC project would require it to be incorporated at the manufacturing stage. The eventual adoption of plasma technology by them is therefore foreseeable in the longer term. 

This EPSRC project provides scope for academic extension and further research involving multiple disciplines. The design of the surface plasma can be further improved such that higher ionic wind speed can be produced. Most importantly, a reliable insulation system should be developed to allow the plasma actuator operating in hazardous environments. Another area that could be improved is the reduction of high frequency noise produced by the plasma actuators. All these require contributions from researchers of different background, such as smart materials, electrical engineering and environment sensing. The results of this project will open up new and exciting avenues for the promotion of both active and passive flow control techniques, which could include synthetic jets, compliant surfaces and vortex generators for the reduction of the aerofoil self-noise.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3A8EE358-2A7C-4836-B3FD-32B8FDBC2CAC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54615607b40383.23194102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A plasma actuator can be configured such that the travelling waves it generated can either enhance or deteriorate the flow. For all of the experiments carried out in the EP/K002309/1 project, the plasma actuators were optimised to the configurations such that they can suppress the wake vortex shedding and reduce the turbulence level of the boundary layer in order to produce a less-turbulent and steady flow. 

Measuring the flow separation noise is one of the main objectives for the current EP/N018737/1 project. To develop a &amp;quot;triggering&amp;quot; method for the boundary layer without subjecting it to large pressure loadings, we are developing a novel method to use the plasma actuator to produce an adverse flow (large scale boundary layer separation) in an otherwise laminar flow condition. This will enable us to study the leading edge and boundary layer separation noise without the need of extensive modification of the current wind tunnel facility.</gtr:description><gtr:id>770A3D48-A3FB-4C7B-86AA-D5B8AE2F6A32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As stated in the &amp;quot;Collaborations and Partnerships&amp;quot; section, the limitation on performing aeroacoustic measurements on high angle of attack, and large pressure loadings for aerofoil by an open jet wind tunnel can be overcome by using the plasma actuator to generate a large scale boundary layer separation artificially. This advanced experimental technique would enable us to study and measure the flow separation noise - something that has hitherto not been investigated adequately in the research community due to limitation in the capability of the wind tunnel facility.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9b731b75786.78678961</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Use of plasma actuators to generate various base-flow conditions</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In order to validate the effectiveness of the plasma actuator in the reduction of aerofoil self-noise, as per the EPSRC project (EP/K002309/1), it is necessary to perform the experiment in a very low-noise aeroacoustics wind tunnel that cannot be bought &amp;quot;off the shelf&amp;quot;. On a tight schedule and budget, I have designed, project managed and characterised a very unique anechoic wind tunnel facility at Brunel University that has become one of the only two available in the UK's universities - the other one is situated at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR), University of Southampton. Brunel's anechoic wind tunnel has been shown to produce very low background noise and low turbulence free jet and it is extremely versatile. It can support projects other than this particular EPSRC project (EP/K002309/1).
