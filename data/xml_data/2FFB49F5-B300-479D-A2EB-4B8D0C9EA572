This programme has several clinical trials looking at important unanswered questions. |Firstly, it is not clear exactly when is the best time to start ART. A trial called SPARTAC is looking at whether treating with ART is of benefit shortly after someone has first become infected with HIV. The START trial will examine whether people with a high CD4 count (above 500) obtain any benefit from starting ART straight away, rather than waiting until the count declines further.||There may be other ways of treating HIV infection early on that mean that conventional ART can be delayed. The HCQ-01 trial is looking at whether hydroxychloroquine, an anti-inflammatory drug may have a benefit in controlling the immune damage caused by HIV.||The class of drugs called protease inhibitors (PIs), may be able to maintain long term HIV control when used alone (traditionally they are used in combinatino with other drugs). PIVOT is a trial that will find out whether PI monotherapy is just as good as conventional triple therapy in the long-term management of HIV disease and whether it helps to cut down long-term side effects as well as costs.||The MRC EARNEST trial will investigate several novel combinations for second line therapy in Africa, to identify the best standard combination that can be used in public health rollout programmes for HIV treatment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This programme aims to address important questions about the best time to start HIV treatment, whether there are alternative aprpoaches using anti-inflammatory drugs, and whether there are alternative strategies to reduce costs and improve long term outcomes.||There are several trials in the programme that address the optimal timing of therapy. The SPARTAC trial has randomised 366 patients with acute HIV infection to ART (12 or 48 weeks) or no ART to determine the time taken for the CD4 count to fall below 350 cells. The trial will report in 2011. The START trial will randomise 4000 patients with CD4 cell counts above 500 cells/mm3 to receive immediate ART or to have treatment deferred until the CD4 count falls below 350 cells. The trial aims to determine what benefits (if any) result from earlier treatment and to assess the health-economic issues around early ART. ||HIV leads to immune activation and increased inflammation, both of which may play a critical role in HIV pathogenesis. The HCQ-01 trial examines whether hydroxychloroquine, a cheap and well tolerated immunomodulatory drug, can decrease immune activation in ART-naive patients with CD4 cell counts above 400 cells. A decrease in immune activation may lead to slowing of disease progression, thereby delaying the timing of starting conventional ART. ||The advent of more potent individual drugs, particularly the protease inhibitors (PIs) means that combination triple therapy may no longer be needed to control HIV viral replication. The PIVOT trial will determine whether PI monotherapy is non-inferior to triple therapy over long-term follow-up, an approach that may reduce long term toxicity as well as result in substantial health economic benefits. The trial has recruited 560 patients at 50 sites across the UK, and will run until 2013. ||There is virtually no evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the best option for second line therapy in patients who fail treatment with a standard first-line NNRTI-based combination. The Europe-Africa Research Network for Evaluation of Second-line therapy (EARNEST) Trial, will randomise 1200 patients to one of three options: lopinavir/ritonavir with 2 NRTIs (the standard of care) or lopinavir/ritonavir plus raltegravir (a new integrase inhibitor) or lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy (after a period of induction with raltegravir). The trial will run until 2013.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4344000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12023/16</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
