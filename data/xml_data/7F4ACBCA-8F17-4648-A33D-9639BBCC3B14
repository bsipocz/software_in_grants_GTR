The current functional ingredients to enable such benefits is chemical antimicrobials which have a limited efficacy on biofilms and a risk of driving microbial resistance. A key difficulty for these formulations is their ability to kill bacteria that have formed in a more resistant biofilm. The screening of a library of over 600 furanone-derived lactams has revealed variants that disrupt quorum sensing during biofilm growth and development, and hence hypothetically they will reduce the propensity for biofilm formation. As with all early stage innovation technologies, lactams face technical, safety and regulatory challenges. This feasibility project aims to address technical hurdles in the application of lactams in liquid detergent formulations such as poor solubilisation and reduced efficacy via rational modification of existing principal analogues. Possible routes of derivatisation will include grafting water soluble polymers or charged groups for solubility or grafting polymeric lactam-containing materials for targeted delivery to surfaces and biofilms. A limited library of around 10 novel analogues will be constructed and their anti-biofilm efficacy will be explored. The possibility of a biotechnology platform that covers a range of applications across home and personal care liquids will be assessed.

The work that MMU will undertake involves the preparation and testing of the lactam anologues. This will allow antimicrobial concentrations of the lactams be accurately determined. The PI and PDRA at MMU will undertake crystal violet assays in order to demonstrate the anti-biofilm activity of these novel compounds. Confocal microscopy will be used to investigate the effect of the lactams on biofilm viability in static and flow conditions. The MMU laboratory research will also explore biofilm inhibition. To do this, the research team will either use the Live/Dead systems or a Bioflux type system - done by visualising LasR gfp (biosignalling) and POA1-LasB rfp (biomass). The Gram negative Chromobacterium violaceum will be used to demonstrate AHL signalling inhibition through lack of the production of the purple coloured violacein. Finally, MMU will be responsible for scientific dissemination to academics in relevant disciplines. This will be achieved by presenting at the International Biofilms conference in Portugal in June 2016, as well as through publishing peer reviewed journal articles based on the research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Beyond removal of dirt, home and personal care formulations such as laundry detergents, household surface cleaners, body wash fomulations and shampoos aim to deliver health and hygiene benefits in line with Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan (USLP).

It will design naturally derived compounds that will replace current chemical technologies in detergents. The beneficiaries from this project will develop outwards from the multidisciplinary industrial and academic research team, through to businesses and the public sector.
The impact of this project will underpin UK research and its influence on economic performance since the development of novel anti-biofilm compounds is extremely timely.

There will be clear potential economic beneficiaries. The market for liquid detergents is expected to increase 2-4% annually until 2019. If the new technology is applied to 10% of the UK concentrated liquids portfolio Unilever is expected to regain a 5% market share within 1 year of the market launch. External economic benefits will include the development of the research capability and supply chain in the area of lactam based materials. Professional laundry service companies will be interested in the improved detergents as these operate in a field where hygiene is even more important. Future cooperation with a synthetic chemistry partner may be required to allow for product scale up.

This work will help strengthen the UK position in tackling biofilm contamination and pathogen transfer over the next 10-50 years. The production of new anti-biofilm compounds such as these have the potential to make a significant contribution to the UK in terms of GDP. We have the potential to lead the UK in this area: the combined scientific and commercial
expertise will enable rigorous molecule development and anti-biofilm testing in alignment with other research projects identified by Unilever in this area.

This project will benefit academics, researchers and companies working in related fields. The research staff engaged on this project will also be beneficiaries. The PDRA will see first-hand the requirements of translating a research idea into a viable consumer product. The PI has a proven track record in training new staff with the range of multidisciplinary, research and industrial transferable skills required to make them effective independent researchers. This research may result in a positive employment impact on Unilever's R&amp;amp;D and production facilities in the UK, plus further growth of the microbial research group at MMU.

This research will provide solutions to changing health and societal issues. Resistance to antibiotics in hospital-acquired infections is a major concern. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are serious global public health problems. ECDC estimates that approximately 4 million patients in the EU acquire a HAI each year - resulting in 37,000 deaths. Given the increased incidence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, the outcomes of this project are of interest to businesses with hygiene related products. A number of medical applications could be explored in this context, such as the development of textiles that are effective against MDR bacteria. According to the Office of Science and Innovation, hospital-acquired infections cost the NHS about &amp;pound;1 billion a year.

One of the key dissemination deliverables for this research will be to identify beneficiaries from the wider general public,educational establishments, advisory bodies, and industry. Any papers generated will be made publicly available - preferentially by the Gold and Green open access routes. These includes publishing results in high quality journals in relevant fields, for example Biofouling or Journal of the American Chemical Society. Results will be disseminated to the wider academic community through conference presentations, including the Biofilms event in Portugal (June 2016). The research will be disseminated to undergraduate and Masters students to enhance and encourage a research-led teaching
culture.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50239</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>It is hoped that the key findings will reduce energy use resulting in a societal and economic impact.

The most significant achievements of the award were the determination of the most effective molecules from a specific group to retard biofilm formation without significant antimicrobial activity. All the objectives were met by both the industrial and academic partners. These included the generation of structural and functional molecule diversity in order to maximise their efficacy and broaden their performance reach and to examine the key technical barrier to commercialisation of these products. The project was managed by the industrial partner according to Innovate UK guidelines and according to BBSRC guidelines by the academic partner. The develop of the novel methodology to test these molecules will be taken forward by the academic to provide a more realistic testing method that reflects biofilms produced in industry systems. Key findings will be used by the industrial partners to enhance or develop new products.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is hoped that the key findings will reduce energy use resulting in a societal and economic impact.
