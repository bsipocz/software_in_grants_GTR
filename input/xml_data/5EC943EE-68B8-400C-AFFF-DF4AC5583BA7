endemic prevalence of many animal diseases including avian influenza in both domestic and wild birds from which UK is under
constant threat. The partners are sharing knowledge, expertise and facilities to investigate fundamental biology of
influenza viruses and predict their epidemiological relevance, to assess potential risks and to devise appropriate intervention
strategies. The knowledge, reagents and field samples will be available through this partnership. which will be essential for development of informed control policies and tools(vaccines and diagnostics) that may contribute to reducing the ever increasing threat from endemic, emerging and re-emerging influenza virus variants posing risk to animals and humans. 

Also, All researchers involved will benefit through ongoing professional development and advanced training in new technologies and new systems-level approaches to disease management. Exchange visits of researchers from collaborating laboratories to undertake training
in a number of disciplines including disease surveillance, molecular virology, epidemiology, immunology, vaccinology and diagnostics
