Resilience</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J006521/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project advances an authentic, strategic community university partnership working across the Connected Communities Programme and beyond. It kick starts a cultural shift that acknowledges community engagement in research as essential to understanding and promoting community university collaborations. One of the drivers for community partners and academics engaged in community university partnership working is the potential these ventures have for improving social conditions and tackling inequalities. Collaboration between communities and universities in the UK as a device for social change is gaining impetus, as more and more partnerships produce findings that demonstrate positive impact. However, there is a major capacity issue for community partners to participate effectively both in individual partnerships with university academics and in the larger strategic policy making groups that have impact and promote good practice. For example, whilst many academics have the opportunity to support any ongoing learning by attending conferences and securing faculty buyouts, community partners rarely get to meet or network to share their experiences and increase their knowledge base. Funding for their participation is hard to acquire. So far, the majority of what we know about what helps and hinders community university partnership working has been presented from an academic viewpoint. The chance to learn from community partner experience and feed this into improving future working and related HE policy is overlooked. We want to set the foundation for a UK wide community partner network that once formed, will influence HE policy and practice:
1: Community partners have co-written this bid and will lead on delivering its objectives in relation to community mobilisation and inclusion. An academic engagement group will work in parallel with community partners. We plan to start by bringing together a group of 20 experienced community partners to share their successes, reflect on the challenges and identify promising practices that support partnership working to tackle social inequalities. To do this, we will create a core planning group of community partners and others, to organise the first UK wide community partner Summit in June 2012, drawing on the expertise of our North American partners. By creating a safe space at which partners can explore their experiences of working with universities openly and freely, we hope to build community partner capacity to influence both the university that they work with and share the learning from this at a national level to inform HEFCE policy and funding. Summit planning will be informed by collating the learning and common issues of concern identified by the CCP, Beacons and SECC projects. 
2: The Summit should inspire and enthuse attendees so that they help advance the recommendations and actions from the Summit at local, regional and national levels. The experience should help sustain and build the resilience of community partners so that they feel fit to shape conversations and influence policy regarding issues of power, equity, shared decision making, funding and sustainability. Working groups will be established to provide the vehicle/mechanism for community partners to contribute to Summit follow-up activities. A significant feature of this stage will involve community partners and CCP academics meeting together to continue dialogue and action immediately after the initial Summit to produce high quality outputs. 
3: We will create a hub for a self-sustaining community partner forum to collectively share and learn from the Summit when project funding ceases. It is vital that the capacity built through this project is available to future CCPs and feeds into strategic developments for individual universities, HEFCE and the Research Councils. Post project resources will be available for academics and community partners to use, hosted through a dedicated presence on the NCCPE website</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to academic beneficiaries, the Connected Communities Programme and HE Policy and Research Councils, the project identifies two further beneficiaries: community organisations and partners plus local communities. 
Community Organisations and Partners: In Canada, community organisations can formally lead on research and partnership development grants to the Social Science and Humanities Research Council, thereby building full capacity to head up projects with academic collaborators. AHRC procedures mean that a community organisation cannot currently formally lead on this proposal. However, it has been co-written with community colleagues Kim Aumann, Sophie Duncan, Sarena Seifer and Paul Bramwell with the University of Brighton and community organisation Boingboing financially subsidising this bid writing process and taking joint responsibility for its successful delivery. The first UK Community Partner Summit will be organised by community partners FOR community partners guaranteeing continued full engagement with the project. For example, a core planning group of partners will arrange and lead the summit event drawing on participatory arts approaches, to create a safe, accessible space that encourages up to 20 experienced community partners to partake fully and produce final outputs. In addition, community sector staff are being commissioned to lead on project delivery and administration and organisations within the public and third sector will be able to access project outputs, for example, downloadable documents and learning materials from the NCCPE website. Community partners represent a major community of interest with real passion and vitality for harnessing university assets for the benefit of marginalised communities. However, rarely do they have the opportunity to reflect on their work together or build alliances that help sustain them at times of doubt or challenge. The project will provide a brand new and overdue opportunity for community partners, as a specific community of interest, to network and build their resilience to develop the work further. Co-writing this bid has already contributed to research capacity building for members of the core planning group. It is envisaged that the process of planning, taking part and producing final summit outputs will provide partners with further significant opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills. For example, making connections between their research interests, building working alliances and collaborating on output production. 

Local Communities. One of the significant drivers for community partners engaged in partnership working is the potential these joint ventures have for improving social conditions and tackling inequalities. While community partners will collaborate to champion the interests of marginalised communities and the need for universities to act as a resource for those communities, the project will also ensure that outputs are translated in accessible ways for local community consumption. 

International community colleagues including members of the CCPH and those working with Professor Michael Ungar and his knowledge mobilisation programme: They should find valuable networks, connections and synergies that will fuel their own community partnership activities and strategic developments. They will draw lessons from the UK context and will have access to materials produced on the NCCPE website for their own learning and practice development. Having a community-led presence on the NCCPE website should encourage community partners to access other parts of the website, thereby furthering their knowledge and skills base in community university engagement, including an appreciation of academic cultures, other research outputs and research processes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31919</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Resilience at Hove Park School is a 10 minute film explaining how Hove Park School has implemented a whole school approach to resilience.

The 'Resilience House' exhibition showcased the various RCUK resilience related projects with which the University of Brighton and boingboing have been involved. Within the 'Resilience House' there were various areas that corresponded to the 5 key areas of the resilience framework and within these we displayed videos, posters, resilience guides and other artistic outputs. Young people with complex needs and mental health difficulties co-curated the event and they explained the outputs to the visitors and were also involved in interactive aspects of the house such as making a 'Resilient tablecloth' and making a 'Resilience cake'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EF29C065-DCC5-4E2A-9047-E4C8F6C5F2FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The festival ran for 2 days and on the second day, the 'Resilience House' was viewed by 135 people (accurate visitor statistics for day one are not available). Visitors to the stand asked questions about the projects that we have been working on and were keen to learn more about how we work with the various community partners. We have received requests to exhibit the 'Resilience House' at other conferences and events in the UK.

The Blackpool HeadStart Partnership shared their resilience model which helps explore potential resources available for young people to build their resilience individually, within their family, school and community. This new and innovative approach to applying resilience theory in practice is highly thought provoking and begins with the question 'What can we change together, so children and young people can flourish and belong?' 25 people attended the forum including a couple of people from Public Health England, who are developing a position statement on Adolescent Resilience to support local authorities to implement their approaches . There were also YoungMinds staff, someone from the Department of Health, a smattering of freelance consultants and NHS doctors and some young people on work experience at YoungMinds from various other London-based charities making up the 25 strong audience.

However, there are real obstacles to keeping communities at the heart of community-university partnership working. Currently, cuts to UK public and community sector funding and the structure and political economy of research funding are particularly pertinent. This project explored the potential to mobilise a network of community partners to identify and develop ways to create mutually beneficial and sustainable partnerships. By working with a team of community partners, with support from community engagement organisations and academics, the project hosted the first UK Community Partner Summit. It brought together community partners and academics from across the UK to think about ways of building community-university partnership resilience. We discovered a series of concerns that community partners shared in common and observed enthusiasm to connect. As a result, this project has set the foundation for a UK-wide community partner network to build collective capacity, positively influence university practice and inform Higher Education policy and funding. A working group of community partners produced resources, and a web presence now acts as a hub to share expertise and facilitate lasting connections. Further funding for a follow-on project has been secured and the community partner working group is advancing the UK Community Partner Network mission: to help build a fairer society by unlocking the potential of community-university partnerships to address social concerns.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They already are being put to use and the NCCPE is coordinating taking this forward.
