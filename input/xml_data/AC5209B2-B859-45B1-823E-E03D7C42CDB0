This workshop celebrates the 75th birthday of C.T.C (Terry) Wall FRS and the 60th birthday of J.W.(Bill) Bruce, two leaders of the UK's very strong singularity theory community. 

Singularity theory arose from the studies in the 1950s and 1960s of H.Whitney and R.Thom on the classification and deep properties of differentiable functions and mappings-it can therefore be regarded as one of the most significant modern aspects of differential calculus. Singularity theory has by the present time grown to be a major discipline in its own right, interacting fruitfully with many adjacent disciplines in mathematics, and also with other disciplines such as computer graphics and computer vision, optimal control, physics and mechanics.

There are experts in singularity theory all over the world and the objective of this workshop is to bring together a number of key individuals to give talks defining the current state of affairs and, especially, promising avenues of research. Younger participants, including early career researchers and postgraduate students, will then gain a clear understanding of the most fruitful areas of research and be able to discuss these with the experts in parallel sessions and working groups. 

As an additional attraction, we plan to have a popular lecture, suitable for sixth forms and schoolteachers, introducing the very remarkable Imaginary travelling exhibition (http://www.imaginary-exhibition.com/?lang=en) which is a unique implementation of the idea of interactive Mathematics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact 

The immediate impact of a workshop of this kind will certainly be academic impact, that is the dissemination of new ideas through lectures, informal discussions and a possible follow-up Proceedings; the passing on of profitable areas and key challenges for further investigation, especially to young researchers; and providing an opportunity for people from many countries and at many academic levels to meet face-to-face, forming future collaborations. We will pay particular attention to having at the meeting a considerable number of young specialists working in the field, with a view to showing them interesting areas for future investigation.

This kind of impact is hard to measure precisely; however we can ask participants to acknowledge the workshop as appropriate in future publications, especially when the workshop resulted in a new collaboration. A published Proceedings will be a more direct measure as to quality, as can an available list of challenges resulting from the workshop. We expect to produce both of these.

Here is an outline of the impact of singularity theory in various disciplines. The main goal of many problems of singularity theory is to understand the dependence on parameters of certain structures from analysis, geometry, physics, or from some other science. Thus singularity theory has influenced the development of many areas of mathematics and physics: it has a direct impact within other scientific disciplines. There are many examples; here are a few which are relevant to the material of the workshop.

- Singularity theory connects the investigation of optical caustics with simple Lie algebras and regular polyhedral theory, while also relating hyperbolic PDE wavefronts to knot theory and the theory of the shape of solids to commutative algebra.
- One of the most famous modern applications of singularity theory was the introduction by Vassiliev of finite type invariants in knot theory. Further investigations led to many other topological applications of his ideas. [V]
- Frobenius manifolds, the basics of which were introduced by Saito and which are finding nowadays numerous applications in theoretical physics. 
- Singularities of distance functions (in various geometries) have led to a whole area of application to computer vision, via medial and skeletal structures [SP].
- There is a significant input from singularity theory to contemporary control theory, and thereby into areas where control theory is used such as mathematical economics [GZ].

Having said that, in the longer term singularity theory has provided insights and techniques in areas which have an impact outside academia. Examples from above include computer vision, where singularity theorists work with engineers who are concerned with object recognition, reconsruction of scenes from moving images, and robotic manipulation. Likewise control theory has many applications in engineering.

A separate area of impact will be with schools and schoolteachers. We propose to include a lecture-demonstration describing, in a way to engage this audience, the Imaginary website
http://www.imaginary-exhibition.com/?lang=en
This will be organized in collaboration with the Liverpool Mathematical Society (LivMS), 
http://www.livmathssoc.org.uk/
which hosts popular lectures on a regular basis. (The LivMS committee member in charge of this lecture series is Peter Giblin, one of the organizers of this workshop.) The LivMS has a large database of local schools and the Department of Mathematical Sciences has a proven track record of public engagement (e.g. three consecutive EPSRC public engagement grants finishing in August 2011). We would expect, on the basis of recent experience, an audience of at least 200 for a popular lecture of this kind.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20310</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Singularity theory has provided insights and techniques in areas which have an impact outside academia.

A special area of impact addressed by the meeting was with schools and schoolteachers. Prof G-M Greuel (Kaiserslautern, Germany) gave a lecture-demonstration on the Imaginary project (see http://www.imaginary-exhibition.com/?lang=en). It was organised in collaboration with the Liverpool Mathematical Society (http://www.livmathssoc.org.uk)
which hosts popular lectures on a regular basis.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>21C51BF6-2F02-479F-A15B-F9C3BBAE6FD9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e0300aa61c19.50261300</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The workshop was an important opportunity to attract experts in the field from all over the world as well as young researchers and doctoral students, to celebrate the contribution of the UK singularities school, while emphasizing future directions and areas of application. The major aims of the workshop were to disseminate new results and ideas, to foster new developments within Singularity Theory and to look for new areas of application and interaction. We aimed to share knowledge of recent developments, and to explain and motivate our interests in different aspects of the subject. Given that the research community in the subject is scattered throughout the world, though working on closely related topics, we saw this as a particularly important aspect of the meeting.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Workshop gave an opportunity to update the colleagues on the recent developments thus providing a basis for further research in the area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8F4153C7-17A6-480F-BAAB-BFA25569B99B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e03a37c6f891.96929840</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/~pjgiblin/B-W2012/index.htm</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J02208X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
