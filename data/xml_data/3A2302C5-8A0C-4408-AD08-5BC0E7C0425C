The onset of these devastating diseases share a common feature, where unhealthy cells in the brain accumulate deformed proteins so-called misfolded proteins. To repair these proteins and restore health, cells have evolved a protective mechanism called stress responses where a family of proteins called chaperones will be produced to fix the damaged proteins. 

My research using the round worm nematode C. elegans has demonstrated a novel inter-tissue communication that allows a stressed organ to send out an alert to healthy cells in other organs to instruct them producing more protective chaperones. This process is called transcellular chaperone signalling (TCS) and is also found in mammals. Currently, the key question for TCS and its mechanisms relevant to human diseases is to search for the &amp;quot;messenger&amp;quot; that regulates this inter-tissue communication. Our preliminary observation showed that PQM-1 (a protein factor that controls gene expression) and ASP-12 (a putative secretory molecule) both play a key role in TCS and stress response. 
We are planning to understand how they function in these events and their roles in the onset of human diseases. Using C. elegans, we will build a new tool that will reveal the protective role of core chaperones in stress response across all tissues in the worms. We will monitor the chaperone expression during normal developmental processes, stress response and TCS to comprehensively understand how &amp;quot;transcellular chaperone expression&amp;quot; could be developed as a novel therapeutic approach to treat protein misfolding diseases. In other words, this means that we could activate protective chaperones from a healthy tissue which then &amp;quot;signals&amp;quot; to a tissue affected by disease (e.g. brain) to produce more protective chaperone. Our work will generate invaluable information that can be indicative to researchers using rodent models to study stress responses in an intact animal. Our approach will provide a great alternative tool to perform pilot studies in C. elegans prior the mammalian animal experiments. This approach will greatly reduce the amount of animals used in these kinds of experiments.

Our aim is to understand how cells cope with stress and how tissues communicate with each other to perform stress response. The innovative research conducted in our team will push the boundary to search for potential treatments for human diseases caused by the accumulation of mis-folded proteins.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>One of the major recent discoveries in the field of proteostasis, is the finding that protein quality control mechanisms in multicellular organisms are communicated between different tissues. Using C. elegans, I have shown that the regulation of chaperone expression is controlled cell-nonautonomously by transcellular chaperone signalling (TCS). A key observation of TCS is that mild tissue-specific stress, results in a compensatory activation of cyto-protective hsp-90 and hsp-70 chaperone expression in other tissues. Thus TCS has the potential to restore proteostasis in tissues affected by protein misfolding disease, such as neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism of TCS is however not understood, and the &amp;quot;transcellular signaling factor&amp;quot; that is transmitted between tissues is unknown. 
 Using a system-wide approach and genetic analysis, I have identified the conserved transcription factor PQM-1, and a conserved secreted immune peptide (asp-12) targeted by PQM-1 as potential mediators of TCS. The precise role of this transcription factor and asp-12 in the regulation of organismal proteostasis and TCS is not understood. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1.) elucidate the PQM-1 chromatin binding profile during heat stress and tissue-specific stress that activates TCS; 2.) define a mechanistic basis of how PQM-1 and ASP-12 regulate TCS and the activation of chaperone expression between tissues; and 3.) establish C. elegans as a translatable model system, to investigate how TCS-mediated activation of chaperone expression restores proteostasis in tissues affected by protein misfolding diseases.
 The immediate outcome will provide the underlying mechanism for TCS and establish asp-12 as a &amp;quot;transcellular signaling molecule&amp;quot;. The C. elegans chaperone reporters will replace the use of mouse neurodegenerative disease models, to understand how TCS can be harnessed to restore proteostasis in tissues affected by protein misfolding diseases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>354456</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/P001203/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
