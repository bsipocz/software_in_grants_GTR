However, despite their central role, the physical basis of the enormous catalytic power of enzymes is not well understood.Initially, tunneling was treated through the introduction of a tunneling correction to transition-state theory. However, the examination of the temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effects of several enzymatic hydrogen transfer reactions has led to a collapse of the semi-classical model for hydrogen tunnelling and new models were developed to explain these observations such as environmentally coupled tunnelling in which protein motions are proposed to drive hydrogen tunneling. It is central to our understanding of enzyme catalysis to test these models further and contrast them with potential alternatives. Especially for the case of temperature dependent KIEs, which are consistent with a model where an active promoting motion leads to a compression of the tunneling barrier in the reactive state and enhanced tunneling, alternative models such as multiple conformational states of the enzymes must be examined experimentally. Based on sound preliminary data on the reactions mechanisms of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR) we propose here to expand the reaction conditions used to study hydrogen tunneling to high pressure and low temperatures. Under these conditions, predictions made by the environmentally coupled tunnelling model can be tested and contrasted with a model based on a statistical population of kinetically distinct substates of DHFR. This work will provide much needed new insight into the mechanism underlying the catalytic events during enzymatic hydrogen transfer reactions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>86081</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>TgK Scientific</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>TgK</gtr:description><gtr:id>14EC7DB7-F4C0-4F26-A59D-8627AE862819</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Developed/built in collaboration high pressure stopped flow, stopped flow FTIR, freeze quench stopped flow, and stopped flow raman experiments.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5459109f9ca6b4.04574436-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided expertise, user training and equipment for instrument development.
