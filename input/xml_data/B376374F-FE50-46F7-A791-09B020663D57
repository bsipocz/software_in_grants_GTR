Though a statistical methodology exists to perform the uncertainty quantification (UQ), the technology is not yet at the level required by high-end users with very slow and expensive computer models, such as the latest climate models. The research proposed will provide methodological developments in two key areas that will facilitate UQ for high-end models. 

The first is a methodology for modelling spatio-temporal output of computer models dynamically. The methods developed will allow statistical models that represent the uncertainty in the spatio-temporal output of a computer simulator, for any choice of its input parameters, to be created that, when sampled from, will allow the modelled spatial field to evolve in time in a way that mimics the simulator and that reports the uncertainty in the representation. This will represent an important step forward for researchers in a variety of scientific disciplines, such as climate, where the evolution of spatial fields in time is of great interest. The proposed work will be developed from methods that the applicant has worked on for univariate time series and will combine techniques for the Bayesian analysis of multiple time series from the literature of state space modelling, with UQ methods that have explored basis expansions of spatial fields with Gaussian process emulation in order to make methodological advances.

The second involves using the first methodology in order to develop methods for using a hierarchy of related, but lower resolution models combined with whatever runs currently exist on the high-end, state of the art, simulator, to model spatio-temporal output of the high-end simulator dynamically. This will be done by adapting and extending current methods for linking two hierarchical simulators statistically.

The research will apply these methods to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) framework of ocean models. This framework contains a hierarchy of four ocean models, with the high-end model taking months to run at a single setting of the parameters on a super-computer due to the fine spatial resolution of the solver, and the fastest version running quickly on a desktop computer so that large ensembles can be generated. The high-end model, known as ORCA12, forms the ocean component of the UK's current climate model, HadGEM3-H. Working with collaborators at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), the methodologies will be applied to existing and specially designed ensembles within the hierarchy in order to model key spatio-temporal fields of interest to the collaborators in ORCA12. This will aid them in understanding the response of the outputs of this important model and assist in its future development.

A further goal will be to facilitate uncertainty quantification for key spatio-temporal fields in the real ocean using the statistical model for ORCA12 and standard UQ methods.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Uncertainty estimations for the predictions of ocean and climate model output are essential for planning and risk management, both on short to long time scales, including the development of appropriate climate change mitigation and/or adaptation strategies.

The NEMO modelling community, and operational agencies using NEMO such as the UK Met Office and the National Centre for Ocean Forecasting and a wide number of users across Europe will benefit from this research. It will give them new insights into the behaviour of ORCA12, the ocean component of the UK's climate model HadGEM3-H, at untried input settings and into the sensitivity of the model output to different settings of the inputs. This will assist them in model development and in making informed decisions as to where to spend their budget of super-computer time on runs of the current model. The planned analysis will provide a road map for future uncertainty analyses using the NEMO model.

The climate modelling community, including organisations that provide evidence to the IPCC that predicts the future impacts of climate change (e.g. the Met Office Hadley Centre), will benefit from this research. Spatio temporal models are ubiquitous in climate science and the highest resolution models can only be run on the most powerful computers in the world. The proposed research leading to a methodology designed to address these two issues and providing an illustration on a high-end ocean model, will enable climate modellers to address their own uncertainty questions using the proposed methodology as a tool and the proposed application as a road map. Climate modellers using NEMO, such as the UK Met Office, will benefit more directly in the same was as the NEMO community

There will be many downstream beneficiaries of the proposed methodologies and their application to ocean and climate models. These include any organisation or body that requires uncertainty on climate predictions in order to plan or manage risk. Examples include government agencies, research organisations, and environmental consultancies that compile information to provide advice to policy makers, industry and society on future climate change impacts, adaptation strategies and risk management; climate change adaption and risk management initiatives with links to the insurance industry; users of the IPCC reports. They will benefit due to the improvements in uncertainty quantification for climate and ocean models. Many of these will also benefit more directly from inferences about ocean quantities made as part of the proposed research.

There will be beneficiaries outside environment-related applications. Non environmental users of computer models are a very wide group including industrial communities such as oil and gas, aerospace and pharmaceuticals. Where these models are expensive and/or produce spatio-temporal output, their users will benefit directly from the new methodologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>219399</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Medical School</gtr:department><gtr:description>DECODE</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA27457E-B793-4019-8518-F4F3A453AD4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Successful application to the Halpin Trust to work on the project.

We have developed and implemented Bayesian models that show the uncertainty in what were previously point estimates of dementia probability and have developed a classifier that accounts for this uncertainty that may be integrated into an app that the team led by David Llewelyn at the medical school wish to develop for primary care. 

We have developed shrinkage priors for model selection in dementia probability that identify the key factors that allow us to predict dementia. We have done this both with and without the usual memory tests that would be given in a GP exam, with the memory tests modelled as missing data that are predicted by the other factors for patients who have not done them. This allows for real time updating of dementia probability during a GP consultation, allowing the GP to administer only some or even no part of the memory tests, basing their decision on the probability of dementia and our certainty in the estimate. A method for eliciting informative priors for some of the key effects on the probability of dementia, such as history of stroke has also been developed. We are currently writing up these results for publication.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>CCCMA</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4EA7561-88CD-4E43-9888-0C6F0947FD76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2 ensembles of the Canadian climate model (atmosphere only) spanning the range of 13 of the model's parameters and all of the associated output.

The goal was to take methods for tuning climate models to the actual community tuning the state of the art models for climate science and to develop a collaboration from the ground up. I spent a month designing ensembles and analysing them to illustrate the power of the methodology and to discuss their tuning practices with them. This resulted in a lot of data and discussion of alternative tuning practices for the next round of CMIP (after CMIP6). A subsequent week long visit by John to Exeter in November firmed up a number of ideas. Data transfer has begun, (from Victoria to Exeter) a paper has been outlined and I am working on tailoring some methods to their practices ready for another visit in the summer.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>SIAM Travel Award for PhD student</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>DR17 E</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>948A7D1D-EAE7-45C7-B111-E8093EDC1B59</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2542a1a2d36.55396281</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>24805</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Past Earth Network</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>75FD993A-6676-43F2-A7E7-F70F641ADC84</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c253371af070.87981792</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Developed new method for designing computer experiments for chaotic models such as climate models, that allows quantification of uncertainty due to the parameters and the parametric dependence of uncertainty on initial conditions and tested on a low resolution version of the UK ocean model NEMO. History matched NEMO for one wave and found that 95% of the parameter space currently explored can be ignored. This is part of a process for tuning the high resolution model using statistical methods and low resolution models that we are currently developing.

History matched NEMO over multiple waves (3) and demonstrated, for the ocean modelling community, that statistical tuning methods for ocean models can beat &amp;quot;by-hand&amp;quot; tuning. In particular, we found versions of NEMO that performed better in global mean depth integrated temperature and salinity with improved global mean square error. 

Showed that tuning (calibration/history matching) for climate models with spatial output is not done well using Principal Component basis decomposition (also called EOF basis decomposition and the de facto method used by statisticians and those involved with statistical tuning of climate models (UKCP09 is a high profile example). Working with my PhD student, James Salter, we have developed a method for history matching using physically inspired bases that can be generated automatically and showed that this performs better than standard methods in a number of test cases.

Further developed basis methodology so that no elicitation of important physical patterns is needed, but that the Principal component decomposition can be optimally rotated towards the data. My PhD student and I have established this works and applied it many times to develop a tuning tool for the Canadian Climate Model. We are at the publishing stage and will hopefully make this tool available and useable for modellers to tune climate models. If used this will have huge global impact as every single use of a climate model depends on the method used to tune it.

Proved a theorem that shows that inference from a standard Bayesian analysis is not as close to true belief than inference made using multiple Bayesian Analyses that I called &amp;quot;Posterior Belief Assessment&amp;quot;. The paper containing this proof has been published in the Lindley prize edition of Bayesian Analysis and subsequently won the Lindley prize in June 2016.

Developed methods with my PhD student Victoria Volodina for emulating non-stationary output of hierarchies of climate models. This methodology works well on test cases and we are in the process of writing up.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The UKESM will feed directly into the next IPCC report and it's output will affect the everyday lives of everyone through its contribution to policy decisions for businesses, local authorities and governments. By improving the quality of the model through use of these statistical methods, the information on which these decisions are based will be improved. As the statistical methods are general for any computer model, not simply climate models, but any area of science, business or finance that uses computer models to assist decision making. Working with people at the Met Office and the National Oceanography Centre to disseminate these methods to assist in tuning the UK Earth System Model (UKESM). NEMO is the ocean component of this, so work specifically with NEMO will feed in directly, but the method can be applied to the coupled model.

I have already taken these methods to the Canadian climate modellers, spending over a month working with them to help develop the Canadian climate model. I've also met with developers of the French climate model in Paris and they've submitted a funding proposal to implement these ideas with their model. I have developed a tool for emulating the spatial output the Canadian modellers use for model tuning that enables them to look at potential model performance of a proposed parameter choice in 3 seconds as opposed to the days it would take to run in full on their supercomputer. Further development of this tool for use in tuning climate models is planned in the future.

The developments for Bayesian statistics have attracted attention of other statisticians interested in how they might be applied in dating for archeological sites, and in food security. I hope to take them forward in partnership with scientists and statisticians interested in one or more of these areas so that they can be further developed and put to use.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0B4511CB-88C1-4308-9185-4A3A7A6FB58A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5948797851.75323377505a70</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data was generated by the Canadian Centre for climate modelling and analysis (CCCMA) using their supercomputer and climate model to run a design generated by myself using methods described in my Environmetrics paper (2015).
