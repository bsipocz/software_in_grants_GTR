The Keiskamma Art Project located in the Eastern Cape of South Africa have remade Guernica four times since 2010. Their translation of Picasso's iconic anti-fascist artwork transforms its geography, time and narrative from: Spain to South Africa, from the early 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century, from anti-fascism to the HIV/AIDS crisis. This research project focuses on this process of cross-cultural translation through the creation of a fifth Keiskamma Guernica and asks why Guernica? Exploring what it is about this artwork that lends itself to being adapted. A series of twelve short documentary films record the making of this artwork. The makers will be interviewed and in their own voices will discuss their role in the making process and their insights regarding the visual translation of Guernica to comment on the HIV / AIDS crisis in South Africa. The makers will also be given the opportunity to express their ideas and needs for change, which will be included in the videos creating their vision of the future. The videos will be made widely available through the publication of the videos online through Guernicaremakings.com, via a dedicated channel on Vimeo (Guernica Remakings), You Tube and the University of Brighton repository. The Guernica Remakings exhibition in Brighton, UK (Jul-Aug 2017) is timely it marks the 80th year from the bombing of the town of Guernica. It is a mechanism for ensuring that the transnational relevance of the messages held within the remakings of Guernica can travel to different regions. This is particularly poignant in a period when the UK is withdrawing from Europe, in part, motivated it seems by fear around the freedom of movement of 'others' Guernica's humanitarian message becomes relevant once again calling for solidarity and compassion transcending borders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The poorest area of South Africa is in the Eastern Cape, it is here within the Peddie District that this research is focused and seeks to have impact. The Keiskamma Art Project was begun in 2000/01 in this region in the village of Hamburg with the aim of raising self-esteem and contributing to poverty alleviation. The Keiskamma Art Project has a history of translating iconic artworks to speak to South African experience including the Bayeux Tapestry and Picasso's Guernica. This research investigates the practice of translation through making, commissioning the Keiskamma Art Project to create their fifth Kesikamma Guernica. In the short term this commission contributes to the financial success of the Keiskamma Art Project and its employment of over 100+ women directly contributing to poverty alleviation in the Peddie District. In the medium term the designers, artists and embroiderers collectively making the textiles based Guernica will develop skills in media and communication through their participation in the audio visual documentation of the artwork, communicating their role in the making process and their insights regarding the visual translation of Guernica to comment on the HIV / AIDS crisis. The makers will also be given the opportunity to express their ideas and needs for change, which will be included in the videos creating their vision of the future. In the long term the video documentation will provide a platform for the makers to be represented and bring a voice to their lived experience of the HIV / AIDS crisis, in turn building community and individuals self-esteem. The relevance of the research is far reaching connecting internationally with other collective remaking's of Guernica through the publication of the videos online through Guernicaremakings.com, a dedicated channel on Vimeo (Guernica Remakings) and You Tube. The secondary geographical focus, and the project's wider impact potential, is within the UK. The Guernica Remakings exhibition (Jul-Aug 2017) is a mechanism for ensuring that the transnational relevance of the messages can travel to different regions. At a time when the UK has voted to withdraw from Europe, in part, motivated it seems by fear around the freedom of movement of 'others' Guernica's humanitarian message becomes relevant once again calling for solidarity and compassion transcending borders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>22866D07-D26A-4F77-B40A-FE4BEB35B926</gtr:id><gtr:title>Guernica Remakings</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e54168372cd47e62c7efed275bcf05c4"><gtr:id>e54168372cd47e62c7efed275bcf05c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ashmore Nicola</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781999741907</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7837b2473262.91937233</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>13E7A0DA-5F00-4B22-822C-90672E15AD00</gtr:id><gtr:title>Guernica Remakings: Action, Collaboration and Thread</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>TEXTILE</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bbd60e51d05dc9f66a73d4a9b92dd48f"><gtr:id>bbd60e51d05dc9f66a73d4a9b92dd48f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ashmore N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a78371c2e4601.20077294</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P00783X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
