The alternate mode, like today, where ice caps blanket both poles - a so called 'icehouse state', is a relatively rare condition for the climate system to be in. Over the last 600 million years the transitions between the two states tend to be rapid and each had dramatic consequences for life on Earth. The most recent of these fundamental climate transitions began around 50 million years ago and culminated at ~34 million years ago at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary with the rapid growth of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Due to the nature of the rock record, this most recent transition is the best studied and most well documented of the greenhouse to icehouse switches, but nonetheless the processes responsible are still much debated. The most popular hypothesis is that it was caused by a decline in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 - an important greenhouse gas. Although it has been recently confirmed that the final rapid switch at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary was associated with a dramatic decline in CO2, it has also been suggested that CO2 may not have been the main driver of the overall transition. There are instead a number of potential candidates that fall broadly into two camps - either this climate transition was driven purely by processes internal to the Earth (such as uplift of the Himalaya, ocean circulation, or volcanic outgassing of CO2) or it involved some, or all, aspects of the Earth surface, including biology, that can serve to cause and amplify change in a number of important ways. Due to the burning of fossil fuels, atmospheric CO2 concentrations may reach values typical of the greenhouse world of the Eocene by the end of this century. It is therefore becoming imperative to better understand the role of CO2 in driving these natural cycles of Earths climate, and consequently, the principal aim of this proposal is to determine the main driver of this most recent and dramatic switch in climate state. We will achieve this using a multidisciplinary approach that has aspects of both new data collection and computer modelling. The new data we will generate will involve revised estimates of CO2 concentrations and globally widespread estimates of ocean temperature, environmental parameters that cannot be directly determined for the past. We will study the fossil remains of sea-dwelling microscopic organisms, the foraminifers and coccolithophorids. These organisms are very abundant in the mud on the floor of the oceans, providing an invaluable archive of past ocean climate data, and by looking at the chemical composition of their shells or the organic compounds they biosynthesise we can determine how warm or how acidic the ocean was. And from such parameters, we can also deduce how much CO2 was in their environment. Armed with this improved understanding of how the climate system evolved leading up to the greenhouse-icehouse transition we can better investigate the natural processes that caused the change. Given the complex nature of the climate system this is best done with a variety of sophisticated computer modelling approaches. Crucially, it is only by guiding these computer simulations with the new data we have generated that we can isolate which of the myriad of potential processes was responsible for triggering this fundamental shift in climate and better determine how they impacted the evolution of life.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78207</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public engagement at Science Uncovered event at the Natural History Museum, 28th September 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0F6F4032-09B9-4009-841D-F9A83432F8E7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public learned scientific information about microbial diversity and evolution in the context of digestive health

It seems obvious that how different living things in a community or ecological system bump up against one another would affect how they evolve. That would include everything from the mix of fish in a lake to the bacteria, fungi and insects that coexist in rainwater that pools in the roots at the base of a beech tree...

However, there are literally dozens of hypotheses about how this gradient came about. One of the main difficulties in testing these ideas is that they mostly make the same predictions about present-day diversity, differing only in the predictions they make about past diversity; and the fossil record is usually not good enough to test these competing predictions. We used the unparalleled fossil record of planktonic foraminifera to examine in more detail than ever before how and when the latitudinal diversity gradient came about. First, we related present-day geographic variation in species richness to environmental measures such as water temperature. Then we tried fitting the same diversity-environment model to fossil data on diversity. We found that the diversity-environment relationship that we see today began during the Eocene (a period when the world was much warmer than today), long before the world flipped into today's 'icehouse' state in which there are permanent ice caps at the poles. These results suggest that the diversity gradient was not caused only by the global cooling at the end of the Eocene, but also a change in the 'rules' by which environment structures diversity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Understanding global patterns in diversity is crucial if society is to manage biodiversity sustainably in a changing world.
