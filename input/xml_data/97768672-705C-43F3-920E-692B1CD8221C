University of Gothenburg (partners 1 and 2 are core members) provides an overall context
within which we will manage the project and communicate with industry, regulatory bodies
and patient organizations. CARe have direct channels to international and national
regulatory bodies, interacts with commercial actors on both the drug development and
diagnostics side and has well established interfaces with patient organizations such as
REACT (http://www.reactgroup.org/) on the international level and its Nordic (NordicAST;
http://www.nordicast.org/) and Swedish subsidiaries (STRAMA;
http://www.reactgroup.org/toolbox/the-swedish-strama-program-2/).
* To exploit the mathematical framework for predicting the spread of antibiotics
resistance (WP4), we will interact closely with 1928 diagnostics
(http://www.1928diagnostics.com/) and Nanoxis consulting
(http://nanoxisconsulting.com/). This is outlined in section 14.
* To exploit emerging candidate drug targets controlling horizontal transmission (WP1,
WP2), we will interact with medicinal and organic chemists within the Centre for
Antibiotics Resistance rEsearch (CARe). Partner 1 is deeply involved in setting-up a
research centre for the development of long-lasting antibiotics (DLLA) at the
University of Gothenburg. This centre will become central in proceeding from
candidate drug targets to candidate drugs. We also expect to hold explorative
discussions with EU-OPENSCREEN, EATRIS and ENABLE, as outlined in section
