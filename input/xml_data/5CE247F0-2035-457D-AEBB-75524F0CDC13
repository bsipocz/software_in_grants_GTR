Underlying any estimation of benefit are behavioral models that capture the essence of individual decision-making. Understanding and testing for the prevailing mechanisms is therefore critical in order to identify how health interventions affect the lengths and qualities of heterogeneous lives. This research explores theoretically and empirically the role of the household in explaining individual and household health behavior. Households are important in explaining health behavior for many reasons, some of which include the following: (1) individuals within households share income; (2) individuals within households share in the production and consumption of household public goods; (3) individuals within households benefit from economies of scale; (4) individuals within households care for one another; and (5) individuals within households experience externalities that work through both preferences and health production. It is well documented that individual members of multi-person households are happier and live longer than their single-person household counterparts. It is important to capture these intra-household dynamics in order to explain health behavior at both individual and household levels.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This research explores theoretically and empirically the role of the household in explaining individual and household health behavior. It is originally motivated by a curious initial finding that in the mixed medical economy of the United Kingdom (UK) longer waiting times, captured by larger regional list sizes, reduce the demand for public general practitioner (GP) visits among women but not among men, whereas higher wages reduce the demand for public GP visits among both women and men. We speculate that the difference in time-sensitivities between the sexes arises because women visit their GPs more often and under healthier circumstances. While this finding is specific to primary care, it suggests a wider problem: applying the same behavioral model to both women and men is potentially problematic given that (1) health behavior generally differs across sexes, and (2) that women and men often live together as a household.

Households are important in explaining health behavior for many reasons, some of which include the following: (1) individuals within households face shared constraints; (2) individuals within households share in the production and consumption of household public goods; (3) individuals within households benefit from economies of scale; (4) individuals within households care for and have power over one another; and (5) individuals within households experience externalities that work through both preferences and health production. It is well documented that individual members of multi-person households are happier and live longer than their single-person household counterparts. It is important to capture these intra-household dynamics in order to explain health behavior at both individual and household levels. More practically, empirical research is often limited to household-level data, in which case we require stronger intra-household theory in order to draw inference about the behavior of constituent members.

This research develops some of theoretical tools with an explicit view towards empirical implementation and tests these models using standard British data from the General Household Survey (GHS), the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS), the Health Survey for England (HSE), and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The GHS, EFS, and HSE represent cross-sectional samples of the population, each very rich in scope. In some cases, pseudopanel techniques enable us to follow rich cohort information over a relatively long period of time and to combine information across surveys. Pseudopanel data is an intriguing and viable alternative when behavioral models privilege dynamics but when panel data is too short.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>162154</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This research compares the goods and characteristics models of the consumer within a traditional demand framework. We examine the nonparametric revealed preference conditions for the goods and characteristics models, and we develop a methodology for testing nested models of this class using nonparametric revealed preference techniques. Of primary interest is to make a comparison on the basis of predictive success, which requires that we develop a method to relate set predictions across models.

The procedures developed here have allowed us to nonparametrically identify the relative importance of nutrients in explaining food consumption. Economists are often interested in estimating theoretically consistent demand systems for food. Since food contains some nutrients that are healthy in small amounts and unhealthy in large amounts, the characteristics model is a very plausible structure for food and nutrients.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m5oMsjT13gE</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Nonparametric Revealed Preference</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B1B5EDF1-2CEE-4FC8-A232-13862DDF37C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Revealed Preference in a Discrete Consumption Space</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American Economic Journal: Microeconomics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b812ccd69f687a78329f72304b98bde0"><gtr:id>b812ccd69f687a78329f72304b98bde0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Polisson M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>pMCvVQeVJwo</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B56585A5-58A5-4694-AEB9-953F4A66BF16</gtr:id><gtr:title>Testing for intertemporal nonseparability</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Mathematical Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d84b7db4004d628d92f398a4be8b106b"><gtr:id>d84b7db4004d628d92f398a4be8b106b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crawford I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545a6d9f19d676.59288016</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0802297</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>FB395309-E202-4FE8-87B0-041A3D72D4D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.5  Research design and methodologies (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
