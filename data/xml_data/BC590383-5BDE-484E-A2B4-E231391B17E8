Waters used to harvest shellfish are monitored for FIOs too. E. coli is a common FIO derived from the gut of warm blooded animals and is harmless, but its detection in environmental samples or shellfish flesh indicates the potential for the presence of disease causing microbes derived from faecal material. Their detection at designated bathing and shellfish harvesting waters at levels above standards specified within EU directives can lead to beach closures or shellfish stocks being classed as unfit for human consumption and can therefore have serious implications for local economies and social activity as well as human health. 

From 2012 the number of UK beaches of poor microbiological status is set to rise because of the introduction of more stringent standards associated with the revised Bathing Waters Directive in Europe. Meeting these new standards and avoiding infraction (and therefore economic consequences) will be a challenge. However, parallel debates over the suitability of traditional versus novel quantification methods add an extra layer of complexity for regulators to grapple with. Recently the US has begun to consider molecular-based enumeration tools as an alternative to 'tried and tested' albeit slower methods that rely on our ability to grow bacteria. This is likely to lead to increased pressure in the UK to consider a methodological shift too. However, with the emergence of rapid novel approaches come difficult decisions for how best to translate technological innovation into up-to-date regulation. As cutting edge science delivers new and more efficient technologies for microbial detection and enumeration there comes a requirement for balanced evaluation of such approaches with regard to their operational utility given their associated limitations and uncertainties at current time. For example, while molecular approaches provide rapid bacterial counts they have yet to be properly evaluated for regulatory monitoring purposes and there is much uncertainty regarding their precision and accuracy for microbial enumeration in the bathing zone. Without careful evaluation the same innovative science could actually bring about negative societal and economic impacts if implemented in haste due to poor understanding of how new and emerging techniques map onto existing health-related water quality standards. With more stringent standards drawing ever closer it is critical that science users and providers do not gamble with a methodological transition that could add further complications to the UK's compliance record.

A Working Group (WG) concerned with emerging quantitative molecular tools for microbial water quality compliance parameters has been formed in response to this challenge. The WG brings together experts from across academic, regulatory and stakeholder organisations to build a knowledge-sharing community. Using a workshop series, and drawing on wider national and international expertise, the WG will build an agreed evidence base to underpin and guide future decision-making in the short to medium term. Molecular tools will be interrogated via three themed workshops focusing on (i) the underlying science and technology of molecular tools; (ii) their potential to inform catchment management; and (iii) their economic impact. Members of the WG are already aligned to inform the World Health Organisation (which has been responsible for the development of revisions to the Bathing Water Directive for Europe) of outputs and recommendations from the project. Protecting public health is a priority. By ensuring that the science underpinning regulation and management of microbial water quality is transparent and thoroughly evaluated we can guarantee that the necessary steps are taken to benefit public health through reduced microbial risk from bathing and shellfish consumption.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97652</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researchers evaluate cutting edge technology for monitoring UK bathing waters</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF168B98-4041-4BEA-98D5-5116EB0EF97E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>University of Stirling press release at project inception

The DHW team ran a public engagement event via the Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique forum in February 2013. David Oliver, Richard Quilliam, Andy Cummins and Jonathan Porter discussed bathing water quality and beach signage information with an audience of 60 caf&amp;eacute;-goers at the Phoenix Bar in Exeter.



Exeter was chosen as the venue given its longstanding hosting of caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique events and because over a quarter of bathing waters in England are located in the South West.



The evening provided a chance to share information and research findings to members of the public. It also served as an opportunity to capture the views of those interested in the subject area and answer questions on bathing water quality and information.

In February 2013, to complement these international stakeholder workshops, the project organised a public engagement event via the Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique forum. We invited Surfers Against Sewage &amp;amp; the Environment Agency to
co-deliver the event at a venue in Exeter (over a quarter of all bathing watersin England are in the South West) and we discussed bathing water quality and beach signage information with an audience of over 60 caf&amp;eacute;-goers and invited debate from the regulators too.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>515A085D-13D2-411D-8823-48DFB4905497</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c1ab87c17de7.08009056</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Delivering Healthy Water (DHW) project had the aim of establishing a UK Working Group to provide a mechanism for the exchange of knowledge, experience and evidence among academic, regulatory and public stakeholders with respect to emerging molecular quantification tools for microbial parameters in EU regulated waters. It did this through the creation on an information rich website and associated social media, via a workshop series with invited international experts (WS1 - needs of the science user communities; WS2 - role of science providers; and WS3 - economic impacts of technology transition) and through a public engagement event. The working group produced a series of publicly accessible briefing papers and a decision making framework and achieved all of the original objectives associated with this programme of knowledge exchange. The guidance documents produced by the project provide a key accompaniment to debates surrounding the suitability of emerging technologies for assessing water quality at designated bathing waters.





Successes and wider significance of KE



1. A UK Working Group comprised of leading experts in the field, policy makers, regulators and campaign organisations was established and continues to provide a network for discussion and information sharing;



2. DHW ran three workshops in London and Stirling with international experts spanning the fields of bathing water regulation and water quality assessment through to environmental economics and molecular biology;



3. 37 experts, from across 23 organisations in Europe and the US participated in the workshop series and a wider global audience contributed to workshop 3 via an on-line survey. The international expertise contributing to these workshops led to the development of a robust decision-making framework underpinned by up-to-date evidence, science and regulatory/policy needs.



4. The main DHW dissemination tool was the website www.deliveringhealthywater.net which provided information on events and a portal for the emerging outputs, technical reports, briefing papers, project presentations and the DHW decision-making framework (DMF);



5. The DHW Briefing Papers and DMF, available for download, provide key, easy-to-use guideline documents to support EU decision making with regard to potential transitions in bathing water quality assessment procedures;



6. David Oliver, Richard Quilliam, Andy Cummins and Jonathan Porter discussed bathing water quality and beach signage information with an audience of 60 caf&amp;eacute;-goers at the Phoenix Bar in Exeter as part of a public engagement event.

The main users of this KE activity are likely to be industry (UKWIR; water utilities; environmental consultancy; landowners and managers); policymakers and regulators (Defra, EA, SEPA, HPA, local government); NGOs involved in public health; and other academics in natural/environmental sciences, microbiology, molecular biology, veterinary sciences, social and public health sciences, planning, and water engineering.



The core working group, who were involved in all stages of the project, included participants from EA (National Laboratories Service), UKWIR, Defra and SEPA and Surfers Against Sewage. Additional participants invited to individual workshops relevant to their field of expertise included representatives from EA, US EPA, European EA.



The key outputs of the Working Group are a set of evidence-based recommendations for research needed to support existing knowledge gaps identified by the team. The project is therefore well placed to support the development of grant proposals under forthcoming funding calls in the area of technology to support water security and general water quality related research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9EE26B0B-4C6B-4736-936B-6A65AE88D559</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9286905042.163008779d521c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.deliveringhealthywater.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6FC7B466-C84C-4F20-9A2A-1A86B448E9C3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Opportunities and limitations of molecular methods for quantifying microbial compliance parameters in EU bathing waters.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment international</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0c3267c3b85e3db0c1c9b4f91ec7d1d3"><gtr:id>0c3267c3b85e3db0c1c9b4f91ec7d1d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oliver DM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0160-4120</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff1ff11e8bd1d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ABD7AC22-2C54-479A-996C-EAD4DA786868</gtr:id><gtr:title>Molecular tools for bathing water assessment in Europe: Balancing social science research with a rapidly developing environmental science evidence-base.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ambio</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0c3267c3b85e3db0c1c9b4f91ec7d1d3"><gtr:id>0c3267c3b85e3db0c1c9b4f91ec7d1d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oliver DM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0044-7447</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56b0e6eb4d8556.55934148</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/I022191/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
