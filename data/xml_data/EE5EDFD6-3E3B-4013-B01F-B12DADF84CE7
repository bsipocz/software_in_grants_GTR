The violence and turmoil by which it was accompanied engendered intense conflicts that continue to divide communities and which have left a lasting imprint upon the landscape, physical environment, and literature of the British Isles. Memory of the events and individuals at the centre of this series of developments has been embodied and crystallised in a vast array of material objects, images, rituals, traditions and texts. Yet surprisingly little critical attention has been paid to the process by which enduring assumptions about the significance of the Reformation as a legendary and landmark event came into being. The participants in this interdisciplinary research project seek to redress this area of scholarly neglect and to re-examine central questions about the impact and effects of this religious revolution through the prism of memory. They will identify and evaluate the sources in which memories of the religious changes of the 1530s, 40s and 50s in England were recorded and preserved, explore their role in the formation of religious, national, social and individual identities, and investigate how far they contributed to the ongoing and repeated religious confrontations and upheavals that marked the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They will assess the process by which successive generations remembered the English Reformation and the complex mixture of remembering and forgetting through which it entered into the historical and literary imagination. A key dimension of the project will be to situate discoveries about England within the context of the development of commemorative cultures in the British Isles and Europe more generally. It will contribute to enhancing our understanding of the Reformation as an international movement which bound together believers separated by languages and borders, but which also engendered distinctive cultures in the different regions in which it took root. Bringing together historians and literary scholars, it will deploy approaches and methods from various disciplines to forge new insights about both the formation and fragmentation of cultural memory and the English Reformation.

The 500th anniversary of the event that is widely regarded as having precipitated the Reformation - Martin Luther's protest against the Church of Rome in 1517 - provides an excellent opportunity to investigate its role in shaping modern historical consciousness and to interrogate its lasting legacies. In its focus upon the agency and influence exercised by the public and private, official and unofficial memory of past events, the project raises questions of enduring concern and contemporary relevance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will seek to make impact on audiences beyond the academic community through a carefully managed programme of dissemination. This is designed to engage and expand the imaginations of individuals and groups and enrich their awareness of a movement that had a major impact on the history of Britain, Europe and the world. The prominence of religious conflicts in current affairs will enable us to underline the relevance of our research to understanding recent and contemporary developments. In particular, we seek to benefit the following constituencies:

(1) Primary and secondary school students and teachers 
Through specially designed workshops we will introduce children and young people to objects, images, texts and documents in which Reformation memory is embedded and compel them to reflect critically upon the origins of their inherited assumptions in the light of their own religious backgrounds and in the context of an increasingly secular society. The material used in the workshops will be uploaded to the website for educational use nationally and internationally. Thereby we hope to influence the delivery of curriculum in schools, especially at key stage 2 and 3, and to inform primary and secondary school teachers and students about exciting new developments in scholarship.

(2) Curators, librarians and archivists
The creation of a digital exhibition involving material from Cambridge University Library (CUL), York Minster and Lambeth Palace will help to foster closer cooperation between these institutions, establish the foundations for future collaboration, and create and strengthen links between librarians and archivists and professional academics, departments and faculties. Publicised through the CUL's existing channels of communication, it will enhance awareness of the content of the collections of the participating repositories, and enable other institutions to compare and link them with their own holdings. It will expand electronic access to heritage items to wide constituencies beyond their regular academic users and make them available for use in other projects within Britain and (via the internet) in other parts of the world. It will help these institutions to fulfil their central mission to enable and augment research, teaching and learning through the expertise of their staff, collections, facilities and services. By generating interest in their collections, it may also promote an increase in visitor numbers. 

(3) The wider public in the UK and abroad 
The website, digital exhibition, public lectures by leading scholars, and presentations at the York and Cambridge Festivals of Ideas (which will also be podcast and uploaded to the project website) will engage members of the general public in the research process and findings of the project. These outreach activities and initiatives will broaden and deepen public understanding of which aspects of the Reformation became entrenched in popular memory and expose people to the material texts and artefacts by and through which enduring myths and narratives about it were created. They will encourage them to consider the roots of their own inherited ideas about the Reformation, and to interrogate prevailing presuppositions about religious developments that have made a lasting impact and left permanent marks on the culture, heritage, environment and society of England, Britain and Europe. Both the digital exhibition and website will have facilities for collecting feedback and commentary. These will provide a platform through which individuals and organisations can contact the project team members and contribute information about local traditions, texts, images, objects and documents that commemorate the Reformation, thus participating in building up a base of relevant source material and raising consciousness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>665645</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Cult of the Book, Public Lecture, Friends of York Libraries, Spring Lane Lecture Theatre, York, 24 November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CBE6BB25-8440-4D97-B28D-422848231FC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Brian Cummings delivered the inaugural public lecture of the Friends of York Libraries in York on his work related to the project.

It led to the dispersal of monastic libraries and the defacement, disposal, and destruction of many medieval books and manuscripts. Other texts were preserved and absorbed into the collections of individuals and institutions in ways that transformed them from sources of spiritual truth into material artefacts of the rejected Catholic past. Libraries thus offer compelling insights into the transformation of cultural memory in the wake of a European-wide religious movement in which Cambridge played a key part, and the migrations of significance and meaning that ensued. This fully booked masterclass placed these contradictory and paradoxical processes of remembering and forgetting under the spotlight. In addition to hearing short talks by the organisers, participants had the opportunity to inspect some of the rich holdings of Trinity College and the University Library and to engage in conversation with librarians, historians and literary scholars on these intriguing topics. The session generated many interesting questions and the feedback was encouraging; participants asked for further events of this kind.

All four members of the AHRC project team were involved together with colleagues from the Wren Library and the Rare Books department of Cambridge University Library.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bea43e60b6f7.73043268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk/events/fully-booked-remembering-reformation-books-manuscripts-and-memory-movement</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Remembering the Reformation: Pictures and Personalities, 25 February 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE38851E-9F34-408D-9705-136370F037D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Why are some people remembered as heroes, and others as villains? Why can the same person -and the same events - be seen in such different lights by different people?
In this workshop we'll be exploring these themes in the light of one particularly controversial period of time: the era of the Protestant and Catholic Reformations. This challenge against church authority launched by Martin Luther in 1517 caused not just religious but also social and political change across sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe; it created arguments and controversies that echoed right into our modern world. People, reputations and portrayal were right at the heart of many of these battles.

Offered as part of the Cambridge History for Schools Programme, this workshop for Key Stage 3 (11-14 year old) students explored why some people are remembered and others forgotten. we explored how images and objects can help us understand this before encouraging participants to make their own portraits of early modern heroes - and villains.

The session was fully booked and the feedback following the session indicated that students had found it engaging, informative and imaginative. Many had never studied the Reformation before. A Cambridge city tour guide who was the mother of one of the children involved asked if she could contact us further to discuss how she might develop a tour of Cambridge for children focused on the Reformation. Postgraduate students from the University of Cambridge were also involved as teaching assistants and they benefited from the experience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bea62564a5d9.45917871</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/schools/programme/view</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Remembering and Forgetting the English Reformation, Norwich Historical Association, University of East Anglia, 22 February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>817345B8-19A5-4A8D-8B4D-F31F99634FEE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ceri Law gave a talk based on her work on the project to the Norwich Historical Association, based at the University of East Anglia.

It has helped to draw positive attention to the project, including our major conference in September 2017, and stimulated interest in it internationally.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beac53b0a8e0.17437330</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sixteenthcentury.org/media/pdfs/SCSC2016.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Thomas Maxfield and his Afterlives: Relics, Memory, and the English Counter Reformation, Relics Cluster, Keble College, Oxford, 23 November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>699C4720-FC79-44B4-9CD0-87345049D7BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alex Walsham gave a lecture on her research on relics as conduits of memory as part of the regular session of seminars organised by the Relics Cluster at the University of Oxford.

These include the Senior Curator of the National Faith Galleries project at Bishop Auckland Castle (a HLF funded project), who attended our Remembering the Reformation workshop in October 2016 and who asked the PI and CoI to serve on the advisory board of the Faith Galleries project; librarians and archivists at our partner institutions (Cambridge University Library, York Minster Library and Lambeth Palace Library, as well as cathedral librarians who came to our Memory and the Library event in York in June 2016); members of the general public who have participated in the public lectures, masterclasses and events we have run in York and Cambridge; and school children who attended the Cambridge Schools Workshop Session that we ran in February 2017. We are sharing materials associated with the latter with the Outreach Officer at Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge, with whom we are also working towards organising a number of public engagement events including a possible re-enactment of a Reformation event. We have also engaged in conversations with the National Archives, who invited the team down to Kew to discuss possible collaborative activities, including a postgraduate workshop.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>56B8AC60-BBC7-4382-A587-EE159289A067</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>589db00aa3c380.40176627</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5F14C3E-3E0F-4460-BA05-0BFD3F3490A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>(Un)binding the Cantiones Sacrae: the York Minster part-books</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/551620de9e772052f30fecb00c0b3708"><gtr:id>551620de9e772052f30fecb00c0b3708</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bronwyn Wallace</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be9e1cd2a455.88785040</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C9F99B9-B2FC-411F-B295-796BD6439A3C</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Remembering the Reformation'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b45602927ef84cef5c03eb3fb5d36184"><gtr:id>b45602927ef84cef5c03eb3fb5d36184</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brian Cummings</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be9bf17266e9.00249469</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5DC2D0AE-1663-40DE-B265-13689459B29A</gtr:id><gtr:title>One Year of Remembering the Reformation: the Stainton Missal 1516-2016</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b45602927ef84cef5c03eb3fb5d36184"><gtr:id>b45602927ef84cef5c03eb3fb5d36184</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brian Cummings</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be9cd91d3500.74749199</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7D2E5FB8-C9B6-4DC9-A649-9D523790F206</gtr:id><gtr:title>Domesticating the Reformation: Material Culture, Memory, and Confessional Identity in Early Modern England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renaissance Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/53080d2b01117026eefed448b96e5a26"><gtr:id>53080d2b01117026eefed448b96e5a26</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Walsham A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be94fc8c9787.97982008</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AEF145DE-9208-4499-A5F9-56D344F32937</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Reformation in Shakespeare</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b45602927ef84cef5c03eb3fb5d36184"><gtr:id>b45602927ef84cef5c03eb3fb5d36184</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brian Cummings</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be9b39accd11.15833372</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F6A1C2B-24C8-4555-8E33-085A7B7F2E70</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marking Memory in John Favour's 'Antiquitie triumphing over Noveltie'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0ebf91ca8c2e0e3ed439c39ba34ac60"><gtr:id>e0ebf91ca8c2e0e3ed439c39ba34ac60</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ceri Law</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be9d83248306.54074473</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M008770/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
