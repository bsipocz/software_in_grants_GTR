One very successful example of these investigations is group theory, which is an abstraction of the basic notions of counting and symmetry. However, group theory is vast, and so we are forced to limit our field of view. Within group theory, a relatively recent and successful addition has been the idea of treating a group, the basic construct in group theory, as a geometric object, so that we can apply results and ideas both from abstract algebra and from geometry to understand the behavior of certain classes of groups. As a further refinement, we often will focus our attention on certain specific classes of groups whose behavior is both illuminating and provides a testing ground for ideas that can then be applied to larger and less-well-behaved classes of groups.

The mapping class groups of surfaces are a family of groups of symmetries of 2-dimensional objects, and so they offer a class of groups that have many advantages: they are concrete, in that we can draw pictures (at least in simple cases) of how the groups act; they are well-behaved with respect to the natural ways of measuring length, distance and angle on surfaces, and so they offer a forum for understanding the interaction of the algebra and geometry; and their behavior is not too straightforward. The behavior of mapping class groups naturally straddles the behavior of other well-behaved and well-studied classes of groups, in particular the linear groups, and as such the study of mapping class groups is naturally enriched by, and naturally enriches, the study of linear groups. This is one of the reasons that mapping class groups are, and have been, the subject of a broad range of mathematicians.

In this proposal, we examine a particular aspect of the behavior of mapping class groups, which is the determination of their finite subgroups. This is an area where the bevavior of the mapping class groups is wildly divergent from the behavior of linear groups. In particular, we wish to count the finite subgroups of mapping class groups. It has been known for many years that (up to a natural notion of sameness) mapping class groups have only finitely many finite subgroups, but there are no good estimates for even roughly how many there are. We recognize immediately that we will not be able to provide an exact count, because this is beyond current mathematical technology. However, we have an idea, which has not yet been fully exploited, that we will use to provide good estimates of how many finite subgroups there are in mapping class groups. The benefits of the work are to provide the global community of researchers specific information about the behavior of the finite subgroups of mapping class groups, which will then increase our understanding of how these groups behave, which will then enrich the study of these and similar groups.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the nature of the question being addressed, the impact of this proposal will largely be felt by the academic beneficiaries. It is unlikely that there will be a direct wider economic or societal impact. That said, there is the following speculative possibility of how the work being carried out here might yield such a wider impact. 

One reason to consider the finite subgroups of mapping class groups is to understand the structure of the moduli space of complex (or hyperbolic) structures on a surface (as described in more detail in the case for support), as these correspond to the points of moduli space at which the local structure is geometrically warped. This geometric warping has an impact on the nature of shortest paths in moduli space, which then has an impact on how best searches might be carried out in moduli space. One reason for the continued and prolonged interest in the space of (complex or hyperbolic) structures on a surface is the extent to which it and similar objects arise across disparate fields of mathematics. All this is required for a potential direct economic impact of this work is for the space of structures on a surface to arise in a practical way. 

Before we dismiss this as a possibility, consider instead the equivalent object, the Culler-Vogtmann outer space, associated to automorphisms of a free group. This outer space is the space of graphs with edges weighted by their lengths, and we consider the possibility that a detailed understanding of the geometry of outer space might be relevant to questions such as facial recognition or fingerprint identification, where the problem can be translated to the underlying mathematical problem of efficiently navigating the space of marked graphs, which then translates to understanding the geometry of shortest paths in outer space. 

We recognize that this is a highly speculative possibility. However, we also note that over the history of mathematics, the most practically useful developments in pure mathematics have not always been so recognized at the time of their development. Hence, we feel optimistic in that we have an avenue for consideration of how these results might be at some point practically useful and have direct impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As this is pure mathematics research, the exact outcomes are difficult to describe.
