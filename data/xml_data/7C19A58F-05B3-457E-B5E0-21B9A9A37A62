Recent archaeological and socio-anthropological studies suggest that the corpse was credited with an enduring social value within 'traditional' societies. This prompts the question as to whether in biblical studies and related fields of enquiry it is still appropriate to accord the corpse a marginal or negative status in the biblical world. \n\nThis question will be addressed by employing inter-disciplinary perspectives to explore how the agency of the corpse (its impact on social action) might have reflected or shaped its socio-religious value within biblical societies. In particular, socio-anthropological and socio-archaeological studies will be engaged to explore the ways in which the materiality of the corpse might have rendered it a social agent as both person and object. A close examination of biblical texts combined with a nuanced consideration of the material remains of mortuary practice suggest that by means of their modification and manipulation (such as the butchering and distribution of the body of the priest's concubine in Judges 19) and their aroma and appearance (for example, the corpse of Lazarus in John 11), corpses are likely to have had a valuable social impact on the living. This further suggests that the dead body (and not only the living body) likely structured and mediated perceptions of the relationship between the body and society, both within biblical societies and within the biblical literature emerging from these societies. \n\nThis radical approach to the corpse in biblical studies will better inform and contextualize scholarly reconstructions of the socio-religious perspectives of biblical societies and the literature arising from them. Research in this area tends to be coloured and distorted by the modernist, distancing assumptions about corpses dominant in Western culture and is often undermined by a prioritization of written material (primary and secondary, ancient and modern) over non-written activities. This project will seek to counterbalance these tendencies by conducting research reaching across conventional boundaries to argue for the valuable social role of the corpse in biblical societies. It will also highlight some of the ways in which the Bible has shaped Western (and scholarly) attitudes and responses to corpses. In doing so, an innovative and nuanced approach to the corpse in biblical studies will be constructed which, whilst involving risks (as any innovative project demands) nonetheless has the potential to engage in new ways the respective disciplines involved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research\n\n(i) Given the influential impact of the Bible in Western culture, this inter-disciplinary research will be of value to a diverse range of scholars and other professionals in fields dealing with the history and heritage of Judaeo-Christian attitudes to the dead - particularly those working in the areas of death studies and socio-medical ethics, for whom appeals to or against the Bible form a part of the debates in which they participate. \n\n(ii) As such, and particularly given the research groups I will consult during the project (see the Case for Support), this research will also be of benefit to those engaged in policy development and the education and training of other professionals dealing with the dead, the dying and the bereaved. \n\nHow will they benefit?\n\n(i) This research will offer these beneficiaries a nuanced and rigorous analysis of various and challenging biblically-based ideas about the corpse and its social impact, place and value. Its inter-disciplinary perspectives will enable those working directly in a Western religious context (including funeral directors and religious specialists dealing with the dispatch of the dead) to better understand, engage and indeed manage biblical and non-biblical ideas about the corpse-many of which tend to be misrepresented or mis-interpreted through the lens of Judeo-Christian 'tradition'.\n\n(ii) This research will also inform and educate those engaged in the social and ethical implications of dealing with the dead body (including medical and palliative care professionals), for whom the influence of biblical ideas about the corpse is not only a broad cultural and social factor shaping the contexts in which they work, but a more particular and under-explored factor undergirding the ethical structures with which they engage. \n\nImpact strategies\n\n(i) During the project, I will give two seminars at the Centre for Death and Society, which comprises a team of researchers dedicated to furthering social, policy and health research, community awareness, and the education of practitioners in a range of professions engaging with death and bereavement. \n\n(ii) Two months after the project, I intend to offer a paper at the 2011 Death, Dying and Disposal International Conference, which is held every two years and brings together academics and practitioners working in the arts and humanities, the social-sciences and the fields of medical-palliative care. \n\n(iii) I will offer a revised version of this paper for publication in one of the leading peer-reviewed journals devoted to the inter-disciplinary study of death and dying (Mortality and Death Studies). \n\n(iv) Following successful completion of the project, I will apply for further funds to support knowledge transfer activities with non-academic professionals and practitioners dealing with the dead in the South West. I have already begun discussing this possibility with a potential partner in this activity: the South West Ministries Training Course, an ecumenical training organisation.\n\n(v) I have also been approached by the BBC's Religion and Ethics department to explore the possibility of my making and presenting a television documentary about the veneration of body remains as relics. Whilst the outcome of this is at this stage uncertain, it is nonetheless a strong indication of the wider impact this project might achieve.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Publication on corpse abuse cited at the Supreme Court of the United States in Snyder v.
