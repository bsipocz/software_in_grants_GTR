We focus on how shock impact on urban and regional systems and the response of policy stakeholders. Resilience is the ability of a system to bounce back from a shock; the community is at the forefront of resilience responses. Fail safe/back-up ('redundancy') is crucial to establishing equilibrium in ecological and engineering systems following shock. Rather than being viewed as an insurance policy for when things go wrong, redundancy is associated with employment loss and as a wholly negative property in socio-economic systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In these research seminars, we identify how ?redundancy? can enhance the adaptive capacity of urban and regional systems following slow-burn/sudden shock events and aspects of planning policy that help cities and regions to cope with both kinds of shock. In Birmingham a one day theoretical ?scene setting? seminar is followed by a site visit and discussion of the Longbridge closure, its slow-burn consequences and planning responses. In Japan, seminars in Tokyo and stakeholder conference in the Tohoku region will build on the Birmingham seminar and pose questions for how redundancy forms a key component of longer-term adaption following natural shock events.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a research topic of global importance and therefore findings will be wide reaching and have an impact on a wide range of organisations in each country and globally and the quality of life of citizens and the ability of policymakers to respond to shocks over the longer term. The theme of redundancy in resilient systems has impact on a range of issues from security and equilibrium responses, through to strategic planning and new ways of considering resource allocation and the identification of resources to withstand shocks across urban and regional scales. We have identified a number of agencies who would benefit from this research seminar event:

1) Government departments in both the UK and Japan will be affected by findings and research papers emerging from this event; in the UK government departments responsible for strategic planning and resilience such as DCLG, the Cabinet Office and Home Office in the UK and which are jointly responsible for developing resilience strategies under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 will be a focus for our dissemination strategy;
2) In Japan the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is responsible for the earthquake response and our work will have significance impact and relevance to the ongoing strategy of stabilising and redeveloping the region following the earthquake and tsunami
3) Government departments developing foresight and scenario planning tools eg; the Foresight Horizon Scanning Cent
4) In addition, a briefing will be prepared for Monbusho as they have previously commissioned research on comparative urban and regional planning and regeneration to which the co-applicants have contributed;
5) Birmingham City Council and the surrounding and adjacent local authorities forming the Local Enterprise Partnership as well as the Black Country LEP; other local authorities and LEPs exposed to a mixture of plant closure, austerity measures and recession in the UK
6) In Japan Miyagi Prefecture and cities and towns within Miyagi as well as Prefectures across the Tohoku regions will benefit from findings related to the longer term development of the region following the earthquake
7) The findings will also be relevant to larger metropolitan regions and cities in Japan that were indirectly affected such as a Tokyo Metropolitan Government where our research network has strong links
8) The Local Government Association (LGA) in the UK and equivalent in Japan including the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations (CLAIR) representing interests and disseminating relevant findings of research internationally to its members in Japan
9) Professional bodies and practice: the University of Birmingham has developed networks and research and consultancy with a range of range of professional bodies including the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) and Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) - resilience across urban and regional systems is a key priority for these agencies.
10) There is a global significance to the theme of redundancy in resilient systems which we would explore through the UN and EU as part of a resilient cities and regions briefing
11) Students and internationalisation of the learning experience: this programme will impact on the longer term experience of students and researchers at the two institutions and contribute to the enrichment of learning in the two institutions. This is part of a longer-term strategy to develop planning and resilience studies between Japan and the UK; 
12) Research: We would build on previous UK-Japan collaboration through the development of a broader comparative proposal on the topic and draw on our international network; develop exchange programmes for academics, students and professionals and develop a shared teaching programme enhanced by the Universitas21 programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14520</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Role of Redundancy in Resilient Approaches to Slow Burn and Sudden Shock Events</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDF2B38D-ED6E-4FF5-9C2B-F4CCBAAE0AFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Generated inter-disciplinary discussion on redundancy in design of socio-technical systems

The concept of resilience has been used at city and city-regional level in Birmingham in a way that has not considered diversity or redundancy (resource) within communities. The concept of redundancy has contributed to ideas around diversity of delivery and has assisted the city in looking differently at resources within communities. Recommendations for a new funding formula for devolved finance of services has been written by the PI and has used the concept of redundancy to inform the process of allocation by basing it on a more diverse and context specific formula including need (deprivation), resource (social capital and physical assets), path dependency (function of district, urban morphology and infrastructure utilisation) and intensity (movement and population). In devolved structures, communities can only be resilient if the underlying structural limitations (or opportunities) are recognised and that context specific mechanisms and resources are put in place to deliver 'good' outcomes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E7DF343A-FF1E-492B-A557-7A6FDAA13178</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546dea6e7cf710.87332391</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The findings and outputs related to 'resilience' &amp;amp; social inclusion strategies and spatial policies at neighbourhood and city-regional level:
i. Redundancy of design in city-regional planning networks and information / knowledge exchange is a necessity; 
ii. there is a need for a more 'realistic' evaluation of interventions and outcomes placing emphasis on context-mechanisms-outcomes of resilience discourses; 
iii. a blending of top-down regional planning knowledge with more tacit level knowledge of households and communities;
iv. recognition that diversification, which may not have arisen without the emergency situation or shock event, can assist the opportunity for recovery;
v. community engagement is key to resilience and the need for diversity and linking of groups who have experienced shock events to let the communities learn from each other.
The research project assisted Birmingham Resilience in the development of Recovery Planning as the project reinforced the emphasis on the need to consider more than replacement in recovery. More emphasis has been placed on this in the city's resilience guidance document and the emphasis on opportunities for regeneration and growth. Both the Resilience Strategy and the Neighbourhood Strategy for Birmingham reflect perspectives developed in the seminars.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The seminar series was successful in aligning a number of local and regional policy actors including Neighbourhood Services, Planning, Local Strategic Partnership, Birmingham Resilience and West Midlands Councils and challenging their thinking on resilience and the role of redundancy in resilient urban systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>23145CC4-7957-4DBE-B0D1-A03E3DFC5DD2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546deabbd7b7d1.06539690</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>307D49F4-C11C-46C8-925D-80525D10080B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Principles for the Distribution of Devolved Resources to Birmingham City Council Districts</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/42ad95fc598aac64a6e6f66d1394900f"><gtr:id>42ad95fc598aac64a6e6f66d1394900f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>546deb58ef9924.56257838</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E564BD70-5F90-4B42-96F9-F8AF6E01E472</gtr:id><gtr:title>Housing Market Renewal: Evidence of Revanchism or a Response to 'Passive Revanchism' Supporting 'Citizenship of Place'?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Housing Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8e2067b2f75e6ab01dacb4a69d51e88"><gtr:id>c8e2067b2f75e6ab01dacb4a69d51e88</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03c03c3120b31</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3458E4B7-739F-4BC8-9FD6-710AE7F6A551</gtr:id><gtr:title>Urban Resilience</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a3deba26d010d8efaa14d89a1a0691f4"><gtr:id>a3deba26d010d8efaa14d89a1a0691f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coaffee Jon</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781137288837</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58a6f6fd8e7e39.18761894</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A443AE61-9F45-487A-96AC-E1EC24B651A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Urban Resilience</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a3deba26d010d8efaa14d89a1a0691f4"><gtr:id>a3deba26d010d8efaa14d89a1a0691f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coaffee Jon</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781137288820</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58a6f6fdbf6c29.04183632</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J013838/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp;
