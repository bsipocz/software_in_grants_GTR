The commentary builds on pervious work we published together ('Homeric masculinity' JHS 2003; Homer: The Resonance of Epic, London 2005) and aims to work out how new insights into specific aspects of Homeric epic, especially the relationship between tradition and innovation, can be brought to bear on a sustained interpretation of a whole Homeric book. The commentary intends to be useful to readers tackling the Greek text for the first time, as well as professional scholars. It includes basic help on vocabulary, grammar and metre while aiming to offer a sophisticated and up-to-date literary interpretation of the text. The Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics (known as the 'Green and Yellow' commentaries) have been exceptionally stressful at presenting high-quality research within a format which includes guidance for relatively inexperienced readers of Greek. We have been asked by the general editors to submit a sample of our commentary with a view to securing a contract at an early stage of writing up. We aim to submit the sample by September 2005. The Series offers an ideal format for the kind of commentary we aspire to write.

Book 6 is one of the most memorable and best loved lliadic books and lacks a commentary of the kind we intend to offer (the closest model is C. Macleod Homer: Iliad 24, Cambridge 1982). Many undergraduates read book 6 as a first introduction to Homeric poetry in the original Greek. For this reason, the research presented in this format- that is in a commentary that includes guidance for undergraduates- will have an unusually wide dissemination. 
Book 6 is famous above all for the encounter between Hector and Andromache at the Scaean gates, but the first half of the book presents features which are characteristic of the Iliad more generally: a catalogue of killings, an extended supplication scene, and a long genealogical digression. Iliad 6 thus introduces the readers to many characteristic features of the Iliad, as well as offering an unforgettable portrayal of Hector and Andromache.

My contribution focuses on the first half of the book, which offers the opportunity to investigate many issues central to the interpretation of the Iliad as a whole. These issues seem to me to cluster around the relationship between individual words, passages and scenes and the wider epic tradition they recall. In order to appreciate the full meaning of a particular episode, it is crucial to appreciate its resonance within the wider tradition (cf. Graziosi/Haubold Homer: The Resonance of Epic) but it is equally important to work out how each individual episode negotiates its relationship with the wider tradition.

One example: at 6.119-236, Diomedes meets Glaucus on the battlefield. They realise they are connected through an old bond of guest-friendship and, instead of fighting; they exchange gifts and agree to avoid one another on the battlefield. Commentators discuss the institution of guest-friendship which informs many episodes in Homeric epic and sometimes commend this case of bonding between enemies. But this particular episode is deeply problematic. Homer caps the scene by stating that Glaucus must have lost his mind, since he exchanged gold armour for bronze. 
The authorial comment underlines the fact that in this particular context the traditions of guest-friendship conflict with notions of proper behaviour on the battlefield. This tension is evident even at the level of language: for example, the heroes exchange armour as a token of guest-friendship, but their action is described in terms that recall wearing the enemy's weapons after taking his spoils (and Homer's final comment makes clear who the loser in the exchange is). The traditions of guest-friendship and single combat need to be understood, but the commentary must also show how they come to clash in this unique episode.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-07-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15111</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D500621/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FED118D3-C8D1-42BF-829F-C2CD1390FF49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>89068F3B-44C7-45D9-92CB-8BE148301439</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Reception</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0CBBED5C-44FC-4F3D-9A21-8E5A3B7AC8F1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
