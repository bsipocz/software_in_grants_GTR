The Scott Polar Research Institute has undertaken an initiative to make publicly accessible artefacts from two centuries of polar exploration. The expeditions of Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton brought to light the importance of technologies to travel. Key decisions - whether to cross the Frozen continent with dogs or ponies - are of course well known, but the use of animals is only one element in the full story of polar technologies.

Protecting the explorer's body from the cruelties of the environment also became a focus for innovation. Much of the clothing of past expeditions look scarcely warm enough to protect us from a cold British winter's day.

Two workshops - 'Technologies of Travel' and 'Field Stations' considered many of these unexamined technologies that transformed the polar world. The workshops brought together leading experts from the world of museums, universities - and modern-day explorers themselves - to discuss the history and the cultural meaning of these relics that were once the engine of polar innovation. Snow goggles, hats, gloves, skis, bindings, and many other objects were made available for viewing by the public at the museum and online.

Were these new technologies the product of home-made ingenuity and invention, or were they part of a larger international circulation of ideas? Did British explorers improve upon and share methods tried in other countries? To what extent were these inventions acquired from the indigenous peoples of the Arctic and adapted for the purposes of expeditions? By tracing these links, we were able to compare the paths of technology sharing and innovation between indigenous and European cultures.

We uncovered the stories of how and why explorers incurred the physical risk to their wellbeing by bringing home these artefacts.
