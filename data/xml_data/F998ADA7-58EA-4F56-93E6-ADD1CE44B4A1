University College London</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J022179/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>UCL has decided to use this year's Grant Balance award in conjunction with the Shaping Capability: Bridging the Gaps element of the 2010 EPSRC Additional Sponsorship award. We have a particular strategic emphasis on cross-disciplinary research at the moment, seeking to realise the benefits of UCL's broad spectrum of research excellence. The interface between EPSRC's remit and medical research is already large, fairly effectively networked, and well-supported, hence we have chosen to focus this funding on other interfaces that we feel are more in need of this kind of &amp;quot;start up&amp;quot; funding.

The areas selected for this year's Bridging the Gaps activities are: Digital Humanities, Algae Biotechnology, Sustainable Cities, and Venture Physical Sciences.

Within Digital Humanities, we will be building on the collaborations formed through our newly established Centre for Digital Humanities and supporting collaborative activities on: The Future of Reading; Text-Mining and Visualisation; and Archaeology, Museums and Imaging.

Within Algae Biotechnology, we will build upon the activities of an existing cross-disciplinary collaboration Algae@UCL, and in particular looking to link some of the emerging algae-based approaches to biotechnology to issues and relationships identified through the IMRC in Bioprocessing, evolving that research programme in wholly new directions.

Within Sustainable Cities, we will be supporting a range of small cross-disciplinary projects identified through our annual call for UCL Grand Challenges small grants, and a two-day sandpit (and resulting projects) on &amp;quot;Big Data in the City&amp;quot; as a collaboration between the Sustainable Cities UCL Grand Challenge and the FuturICT FET Flagship activity. A research associate will be supported working to support community building, in particular around sustainable mobility, sustainable resources and architecture and retrofitting.

Within Venture Physical Sciences, we will be supporting 3-4 highly adventurous Physical Sciences projects, looking to explore new avenues that cross existing divisions within Physical Sciences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the wide range of cross-disciplinary research to be supported through this activity, the potential beneficiaries are extremely broad. Naturally the potential impact that such relatively small pilot studies might make individually is likely to be relatively limited and generic at this stage, but where substantial programmes result, these may be more profound.

For Digital Humanities, each of the activities will be collaborative with appropriate users, including electronic publishers, libraries, museums and field archaeologists. Hence, the research may lead to better adoption of digital technologies within each of those domains, providing benefits to those that use their services, especially in terms of accessibility and cost-effectiveness of digital resources.

For Algal Biotechnology, there are potential impacts in terms of both improved manufacture of certain pharmaceuticals, with obvious potential health and economic benefits, and better handling of environmental waste, with clear quality of life and sustainability advances.

For Sustainable Cities, there are a very wide range of potential impacts for those who live in cities, and the organisations that manage the urban environments. Obvious examples include the ways in which improved access to data might improve the ability of travellers to plan and adjust their journeys, and better access to local government information might empower citizens and social enterprise.

In each of these three cases, a likely route for follow-on collaborative projects would be through EngD studentships through the corresponding EPSRC EngD centre: Virtual Environments, Imaging and Visualisation; Bioprocess Leadership; and Urban Sustainability and Resilience.

In addition, our Sustainable Cities activity has strong links with (and will be supporting the establishment of) the new UCL Institute of Sustainable Resources, established with a large donation from mining company BHP Billiton. The on-going partnership with BHP Billiton will provide a major route for impact into the global resources sector.

For Venture Physical Sciences, the most likely short and medium-term impacts will be through media activities (e.g. BBC website, science documentaries) to those members of the public with a particular interest in the frontiers of knowledge.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>149662</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Next generation HPC consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>F9C0E25B-448F-4AA7-9389-D0827CC90716</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b97243feb972441c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The e&amp;shy;_Infrastructure South consortium is formed through a partnership of the Universities of Bristol, Oxford, Southampton and UCL.

It hosts the EPSRC-funded UCL Security Science Doctoral Training Centre (UCL SECReT) and the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science (JDI). This project launched the &amp;quot;JDiBrief&amp;quot; website, hosting a repository of succinct (4&amp;shy;_page) practice guides, also created as part of the project, which summarise the latest research findings on crime, policing and security issues. These act as digests: classifying, condensing and demystifying current research findings (from academic and government sources), so that industry partners can easily assimilate the information.

The first was a public engagement event called &amp;quot;Focus on the Positive&amp;quot;, building on the success of our existing Bright Club events, by inviting a participating audience to express their opinions, vote for, and indeed contribute their own funding for, potential future activities in the area of Sustainable Cities. &amp;quot;Focus on the Positive&amp;quot; is a public event with a professional compere, at which six to eight speakers take five minutes each to describe a problem with the world and a way that it could start to be addressed.

The second activity was to help develop UCL doctoral students' public engagement skills via a programme called &amp;quot;Train and Engage&amp;quot;. Train and Engage provides training and grants for UCL EPSRC-&amp;shy;_ funded postgraduate students. The training helps students develop their ideas for activities that open up their research and practice to involve people beyond the context of the university.

29 UCL PhD students and researchers trained in public engagement. A number of these have gone on to lead public engagement initiatives, as well as train their peers and supervisees in public engagement mechanisms.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9890432320.433140bc88bb2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1210/121011-focus-on-the-positive</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011,2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The 2011-2012 EPSRC Strategic Award and 2010 EPSRC Grant Balance Award to UCL were combined to support a large range of smaller-scale institutionally focused activities to: (1) increase the impact of EPSRC supported research to industry, policy makers and the general public; (2) widen the pool of researchers involved in research; and (3) generate novel, creative excellent research at the borders of traditional disciplines ('bridging the gaps').

Notable impacts include:

(1) The aim of an policy engagement activity by the Energy Institute (P. Ekins) was to extend UCL's knowledge base on energy efficiency (U-value) range of solid walls found in UK dwellings and summarising research findings in a form suitable for communicating the findings to policy makers. Major outputs included the development of a revised calculation of the impact that changes in solid wall U-value have on energy use in the UK, and a number of brief policy reports aimed at policy makers, particularly within Dept. of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).

(2) R. Downes (UCL Mathematics) undertook a 3-month internship within BIS. He supported the newly created e-Infrastructure Leadership Council, set up in early 2012 by the Minister for Universities and Science, David Willets, to advise the government on all aspects of e-infrastructure (comprising computer resources and associated hardware, networking, software, training and skills).

(3) Arising from a 'bridging the gaps' sandpit in 'Big Data in the City', and using Internet-enabled smartphones, this project aimed to seamlessly and comprehensively log activity - especially travel- and exercise-related activity - undertaken by people suffering from non-communicable health conditions for which patient inactivity is a contributory factor. By automatically measuring trip mode and distance, and by offering feedback in the form of the graphing and sharing of activity with other study participants (a positive and gentle 'push' to the user), the ultimate aim is to promote healthy choices through the creation of an effective peer support group. Work has shown that there is a clear gap in this field, and UCL Hospitals (UCLH) has shown real interest in supporting a full trial. Funding from the SA supported the involvement of the research team, and purchase of 5 smart phones.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3DC7D7BB-5199-402B-99BB-071C63F9EAA7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-4411359377.58848de26252a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant was used to support activities addressing 4 primary strategic intents: (1) promoting wider impact of EPSRC supported research to industry, policy makers and the general public; (2) widening the pool of individuals exposed to the research process with the general aim of encouraging future research leaders in engineering and physical sciences from non- traditional as well as traditional backgrounds; (3) promoting novel, creative and excellent research at the borders between traditional research disciplines (&amp;quot;bridging the gaps&amp;quot;); and (4) promoting maximum use of UCL-based equipment and research facilities (equipment sharing) by engineering and physical sciences researchers across UCL and beyond.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Informing government policy - via secondments to Government departments, and for example website which summarise the latest research findings on crime, policing and security issues.
