proposed research is going to develop low cost, secure, point of care ultrasound imaging for prenatal care for India. The availability of skilled technician or doctor that can conduct ultrasound scanning for pregnant mothers in remote areas is a major challenge in India. Usage of diagnostics ultrasound in India has also been controversial because of its extensive misuse for sex-selective abortions. Indian government introduced legislation back in 1994 to ban the disclosure of foetus gender through the PC-PNDT (Pre-Conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques) Act and continuously tightened regulation to limit such misuse, these efforts have had limited or no effect on the ground. The nature and scale of the problem is unique to India. A secure ultrasound scanning system with guided image capture and a remote diagnostic service, that can work in rural areas in India, is essential to significantly improve the prenatal care, health assessment and wellbeing for the baby and the mother. The Indian challenge is also valid in other Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) on the OECD DAC list of ODA recipients, such as African states.

The proposed research builds on state of the art freehand 3D ultrasound technology, care pathway modelling and design, cloud based framework for ultrasound image analysis, servitization of the healthcare provision and augmented reality based digital medical assistant for prenatal scanning. This research will build on the existing research and investigate new technology development to address the 'skills shortage' and 'selective abortion' challenges in India during prenatal care. The research will bring the best universities and research institutes in India to work directly with Cranfield University to solve this social challenge using latest technologies. 

This research will build capability and capacity in less-skilled ultrasound scanning for prenatal care with no visual feedback during scanning in India. The research will start with a two weeks long stakeholder interaction in India and intensive literature review. The interaction will involve direct prenatal care observation in unstructured rural areas, rural healthcare centres, semi-urban municipality areas, urban deprived areas and modern hospitals as per the ethical guidelines of India. A shorter interaction will take place with three surgeries and three hospitals in the UK. Engaging with the end user to better understand their expectations and requirements will be a major focus of this part of the research. The requirements will be the basis for the ultrasound scanning system development, starting with a concept design. The system will have two major components: the ultrasound transmit and receive system with customised ultrasound transducer and the AR based data capture assistant. Working prototypes of the technologies will be built for controlled clinical validations. During the research across the two countries, ethical guidelines and processes will be implemented in a systematic manner in compliance with the requirements from Cranfield University, IISc, SJRI and NIAS. The research will address the cultural and social sensitivities of the participating communities. This will have direct impact on the user interaction, data capture, transmission and storage. New technologies developed will be tested in laboratory conditions first and then in SJRI within a controlled clinical environment. The new ultrasound hardware and software performance will be compared to the best quality ultrasound scanners available in the commercial market. In parallel, the impact of the secure ultrasound scanning service for mothers across different communities will be studied using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The impact of the novel technologies on the Indian society will be studied in detail by NIAS. the research team will engage with the manufacturers and their supply chain to further exploit the results of this research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The SecureUltrasound research will impact people, knowledge, economy and the society as follows:

Impacting people:
The proposed research is going to develop low cost, secure, point of care ultrasound imaging for prenatal care for India. Ultrasound is a safe and cost effective medical diagnostic technology used around the world for multiple medical conditions including prenatal care. The availability of skilled technician or doctor that can conduct ultrasound scanning for pregnant mothers in remote areas is a major and unique challenge in India. Usage of diagnostics ultrasound in India has also been controversial because of its extensive misuse for sex-selective abortions. This research will develop novel technologies to address these challenges in India. The project will enable the widespread and safe use of ultrasound scanning for prenatal care across India. This research will have a secondary impact on the UK by helping to provide ultrasound scanning for prenatal care at the surgery level. Both countries will improve antenatal care and reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Each researcher will be supported through several researcher development programmes and research staff development conferences across the partner organisations. Cranfield University has EU recognition for HR Excellence in Research. Entrepreneurship of the researchers will be encouraged through Cranfield Venture Day and through training on commercialisation at IISc. The staff development will enhance the career prospect of the research team and will significantly support their international profile development in research. 

Impacting knowledge:
There are two areas of fundamental knowledge development: use of MEMS based sensors with the 2D ultrasound scanners to develop 3D images without any visual guidance; and the skin contact detector and the foetal motion detection for ultrasound data capture assistance. The research will develop new knowledge in using the inertial information to spatially locate 2D images and their relationships with other images. The data capture assistance must consider different skin conditions and maturity of the pregnancy and understand the complex relationships between the biological parameters, the movement of the transducer with the quality of the currently acceptable ultrasound scans i.e. 3MHz centre frequency and about 100% bandwidth. The research will also develop new knowledge in overlaying of a dynamically adjusted grid and movement advice on the mother during the data capture. The adjustment will cover size and shape of the body and the quality of the transducer movement. Implicit knowledge on the prenatal screening of babies and mother health assessment will be made explicit through a structured knowledge capture process.

Impacting economy:
The research will impact significantly on the Indian economy by making ultrasound scanning more accessible and popular across India. Millions of more people in rural areas would be able to access the service despite a lack of skilled technicians in the areas. During the project, a commercialisation route will be agreed amongst the participating organisations. Professor Arora will identify manufacturers in India that will exploit the technologies developed in the research. The team in the UK will be engaged with the NHS to explore further exploitation of the service at the surgery level.

Impacting the Society:
The research team will impact society through direct intervention and by addressing a unique societal challenge in India. 1. The research will stop parents discriminating against female foetuses. The research will allow much more people in India to access the benefits of ultrasound scanning during pregnancy. This will significantly improve antenatal care and reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality rates across India. The research will improve the boy-girl ratio in the country over time.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>970750</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R013950/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
