The process takes place in air environment at atmosphere pressure using low cost equipment. 

The process involves the simple dipping of a substrate into a solution of potassium hydroxide, following by another dipping into a metal ions solution. The first dipping allows the opening of the imide ring chemical structure and insertion of the potassium ions into the broken chemical ring. The second dipping allows the swapping of the potassium ions with the ions of the electrolyte solution. 

A laser or a flood exposure equipment using a photomask can be used to reduce the surface metal ions resulting in a gradient of metal ions, then the ions diffuse into the depleted zone and reach the surface where they reduce. A mild electron-donating agent has been used to accelerate the reduction of the ions. A thin layer of metal nanoparticles is then formed using this simple process, which can be used for subsequent electroless plating or for sensing purposes. Our preliminary feasibility studies published in IEEE transactions in Nanotechnology have demonstrated the concept using a synthetic agent at the cost of long exposure time and damage to the substrate. 

We started using a bio-inspired material, chlorophyll extracted from spinach leaves, to speed up the photochemical process from 3 hours to 1 minute exposure using a blue light LED. We wish demonstrate that the use of chlorophyll can enable a truly manufacturing process that can be scaled up, and fully characterised for plastic electronics, PVs, moulded interconnects in electronics, sensing applications, in conjunction with additive manufacturing for multi-material manufacturing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95066</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Additive Manufacturing and 3D printing workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C194090E-3F30-4D52-AB65-70FF90D27530</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The International Microelectronics and Packaging Society (IMAPS) Workshop on Additive Manufacturing (printing) for packaging was hosted by Dr. Robert Kay at Loughborough University on the 22nd October 2015. This workshop brought together a range of individuals primarily from industry in order to introduce them to the current developments and activities in 3D printing applied to the field of electronics. The workshop was split into a morning session which educated these new individuals into the field of Additive Manufacturing and then in the afternoon covered the latest developments in academia and industry around 3D printing for electronics manufacturing. The research findings from two EPSRC projects was also showcased at this event (EP/L017415/1 &amp;amp; EP/L022133/1). Besides the networking benefits from this event the investigators on this grant were able to establish new collaborations with industry on existing and future research activities. The event also raised the awareness of many of the research activities in this field currently being conducted by UK Universities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c69226d05a91.34725988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://imapsuk.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/additive-manufacturing-and-3d-printing-workshop-programme-announced/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>347680</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Manufacturing with Light II</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/N018222/1, EP/N018265/1, EP/N018265/2</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>073332AC-114B-4C77-B974-33D54A539D8C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c66e41c197c2.63657251</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has developed a method to 3D print plastic components where metal nano-particles can be selectively be reduced using light irradiation on the surface of the part. These parts have proven to have effective antimicrobial surfaces. As a result a 3D printed water filter was fabricated and tested during the project. This particular water filter was shown to effectively eliminate cryptosporidium a water borne pathogen that causes intestinal cryptosporidiosis. This simple to produce filter opens up a whole host of societal benefits for cleaner drinking water especially in developing countries that may lack ability to cheaply treat water locally.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A06B14AC-3BD1-471B-A3F7-7A210676DD1D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e165eae2c982.27078799</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This initial speculative feasibility project made new scientific breakthroughs and demonstrated the proof of concept around a highly novel concept of 'Green synthesis' methods which can selectively metallise a range of planar, flexible or 3D plastic parts with metal nanoparticles. This new manufacturing approach has the potential to enable low cost, sustainable and environmentally friendly manufacturing processes for the production of metal tracks, antimicrobial surfaces, and electrochemical sensors and actuators, which can benefit a range of industrial applications.
