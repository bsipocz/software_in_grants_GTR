As the number of professional men and women grew and their influence increased, it has been argued that they developed a distinctive view of the positive role that the state should play in reducing social and economic inequality and that this had a detrimental effect on Britain?s economic performance in the decades before the Great War and continues to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The present study aims to test this hypothesis by taking a sample of 1,000 individuals recorded in the 1851 census as being a member of the professions and reconstructing their own and their descendants? biographies through three generations. By collecting then analysing a wide variety of biographical details about members of the cohort&amp;nbsp; -&amp;nbsp; their social origins, education, choice of marriage partner, children?s and grandchildren?s occupations, wealth, religious and political affiliation, leisure activities, etc -&amp;nbsp; it is hoped to answer definitively whether the Victorian professions formed a separate caste within the wider middle-class with its owns values, interests and social practices. Account is taken in the study of the possibility of regional differences and the cohort has been drawn from nine British towns with different profiles.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study has significant policy implications in that much of the criticism of the bureaucracy by the advocates of 'new public management' is predicated on the assumption that there is a self-sustaining professional class with a liberal agenda that impedes attempts at reform of the public sector. This research is designed to investigate the validity of this assumption, and to test whether or not it is a misrepresentation of a more nuanced professional class that is much less homogenous than critics often assume. If this is the case then critics will need to look more deeply into the composition, behaviour and interactions of the professional class to justify their claims. These are the focal points of this proposal and it is anticipated that the results will inform the debate about the role a putative professional class plays in social and economic development. 

The research will contribute to the methodology of longitudinal study of populations and the ways in which data can be harvested and collated from a variety of sources to gain a much more rounded perspective that can inform larger questions such as those addressed by this proposal. Although there are problems of confidentiality in such longitudinal analysis in the contemporary world, this does not invalidate the methodological approach adopted here. One of the key components in our approach is content generated by users and discoverable in their social networks, largely by those with an interest in the past, particularly local and family history.

Apart from policy implications the primary non-academic beneficiaries of the project will be members of the public with an interest in history. We have identified three overlapping groups. The first will be those with a general interest in the subject who are not necessarily research active as local and family historians. In this group, we would include those whose engagement with history is primarily through the broadcast media and the mainstream press, as well as readers of popular history magazines such as History Today (circulation 27,900) and BBC History Magazine (69,400). Through a series of articles in these publications and national newspapers, together with coverage in the broadcast media (predominantly BBC radio) this broad historically engaged public will obtain an improved understanding of nineteenth-century British society and the professions. 

A second, related, group of beneficiaries will be the large community of family history researchers in the UK. There are no reliable estimates of the size of this group, but there were 100,000 members of family history societies in Britain during the last decade (Fowler 2003). Genealogists will benefit from the project by developing an improved knowledge of the world in which their ancestors lived, and a better understanding of the sources that will provide our core data. This will be achieved through the publication of the prosopographical database on a website containing supporting contextual material, engagement with online social networks and articles in magazines such as BBC Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine (circulation 22,400). 

The third group to benefit will be local historians, both in the towns that are the subject of our study and more generally. A dayschool at the University of Oxford, talks to local history societies, and a methodological article in The Local Historian will be designed to provide participants and readers with an improved understanding of the role of the professions within local communities. By focussing on our research methods as well as our findings, we will equip local historians with the knowledge to begin their own research on the professions and other groups within nineteenth-century society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>593695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Northuberland and Durham Family History Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Northumberland and Durham Family History Society</gtr:description><gtr:id>B00C08DC-AF8F-4E79-B1BD-28A1F70F78F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mutual enlightenment</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55ffea34d7cd72.45980401-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The FHS participation has been coordinated by our team, but they have largely worked autonomously, saving the project considerable time and funds.

The project set out to explore the extent to which the Victorian and Edwardian professions, a fast expanding section of society in this period, formed a separate class distinct from the entrepreneurial or commercial middle class to which it has usually been attached by social historians. The professions' distinctiveness was argued very strongly by Harold Perkin in the late 20th century but his claims have never been tested. The project set out to test Perkin's assertion by charting across four generations the family history of some 800 members of the professions living in nine British provincial towns in 1851, each with a distinctive economic profile and of a different size (Alnwick, Morpeth, Winchester, Brighton, Bristol, Leeds, Merthyr Tydfil, Greenock and Dundee). The collection of biographical informationon some 16,000 individuals comprising the initial cohort, their parents, children and grandchildren has provided the research team with a robust data set to interrogate Perkin's idea. 

Analysis of our data has led us to conclude that Perkin's argument only holds in part. There is now overwhelming evidence that professional families could exhibit both strong and weak vertical and horizontal professional ties. There IS evidence of a professional project (i.e. a caste mentality) but primarily among members of the traditional professions of the church, law and medicine, such as the Wickhams of Winchester. Within these groups, there is a tendency for sons and grandsons to be placed in the professions, though even here this is not exclusively the case. In the case of the state and new professions, such as engineering, there is a much greater tendency for sons and grandsons to move into trade or business, In the case of the fringe professions, sons and grandsons frequently move out of the middle-class altogether. The sons of the inventor, Thomas Symes Prideaux, for instance, end up as railway clerks. Once a branch of the family has left the professions, they seldom get back in. It seems too that the families involved in a professional project are also distinguished from their peers by their wealth, location and education. The age of the profession is only one among several factors.

At the same time, and more importantly, the information in our data set has allowed us to go beyond the original question and construct a completely new account of British professional, and by extension middle-class, society in Victorian and Edwardian Britain. What we have discovered there is not one British professional society but a series of regional ones, These regional professional societies share common characteristics but exhibit local peculiarities. For instance, in the case of the majority of the towns under study, there is little sign of a metropolitan effect: professionals and their descendants largely remain in their area they came from. In Brighton, perhaps understandably, there is much greater interaction with London but generally only the very wealthy and the poor migrate to London. There is also limited signs of emigration, except in Dundee. 

Unexpectedly, moreover, we have found that in all of our towns, there is evidence of a race to the bottom across the three generations. With a few exceptions, grandsons are poorer at death than members of the original cohort, even where they are still in the professions. This is a very surprising discovery which has yet to be properly explained. It may reflect that the professions (especially medicine) are overcrowded at the beginning of the 20th century and that this has a negative effect on income. It may be that expenditure goes up across the generations as Britain becomes more affluent and there is more to buy. Or it may simply reflect imprudence, such as an early marriage or a large family. Whatever the truth, there is limited evidence from the study so far that professional families in 1851 successfully sired dynasties that would come to dominate their local towns and societies in the modern era. This is a story of downward rather than upward mobility. The few exceptions to this, such as the James family of Merthyr Tydfil, were already in positions of local power before the nineteenth century. It was certainly not the First World War that destroyed these middle-class dynasties.

Our study has also made some key findings about the female members of our professional families. Very few of the wives, daughters and granddaughters in our study entered a profession in their own right. Those who did tended to be nurses, teachers, and stenographers (i.e. at this date very much on the fringes). Four of the six daughters of Henry Diddums, a teacher and a lay preacher who died intestate, became teachers, one died young, and the other became a pawnbroker's assistant. This is not to say that women did not work. Quite a high proportion, especially in Leeds, were occupied as shopkeepers and dressmakers. These women tended to be married to members of the semi-professions and their husbands frequently left the professions across their adult life. Moreover, many women worked hard at home: again, to our surprise, we have discovered that between 25 and 40% of our families across the generations did not have a live-in servants. Whether working outside or inside the home, however, the females in our database were carefully protected from exploitation once their fathers or husbands were dead. A common feature of wills regardless of the total value of the estate was the use of trusts which protected bequests to women and other vulnerable family members. Many of these women were quite well-off as a result. This may help to explain another surprising discovery: the large percentage of daughters and granddaughters who did not marry, far above the national average. It was not the First World War which created a phalanx of middle-class spinsters. 

Finally, pace Perkin, there is a limited sign of political commitment or social concern among the families we have investigated. Both men and women appear to be family-orientated. There is less evidence of engagement with local politics, philanthropy, churches and leisure pursuits than we expected, though there is more evidence of this in Bristol and Brighton than in Merthyr. Virtually no one leaves money outside the family in their wills.

Of all the findings of this study, the most significant is that our families for the most part were part of a local or regional society and had a limited national, let alone international, profile. There was a rich elite (less than10 per cent) whose families were geographically mobile, sent their sons to public school and university, were well acquainted with London, and had a primary British identity. But this was not the case with the large majority who were brought up and educated locally, often married locally, and usually stayed close to their original home throughout their lives. The railways seem to done little to extend their horizons. Even when people emigrated, as was particularly the case of Dundonians whose town was falling on hard times, they appear to have created their old local world wherever they moved to. This discovery cuts completely across the dominant view of the middle-classes of Victorian Britain. Historians looking from the top down have painted a picture of a mixed landed and bourgeois elite impregnated with values of empire and service through the shared experience of public school, Oxbridge and political engagement. Our study reveals this was only true of a small minority of the middle-class: most males in our families wouldn't even have had much access to classical culture. If this was the case, then we will need to rethink the middle-class reaction to the First World War. Arguably most subalterns had little interest in king and country; if they were fighting for anything, it was to preserve their local world. Indeed, the team would go further and suggest that it was exigencies of the First World War that first seriously undermined middle-class localism by devising national norms and standards, enforced by the state from above. Even then, the creation of a new nationally-orientated middle class did not appear overnight and the forces of localism continued to resist top-down interference until after the Second World War. So important do we think our discovery of the centrality of localism to be that the book of the project which the team is writing in the current year will be entitled The Professions, the Middle Classes and Local Identity in Victorian and Edwardian Britain.

Three years of studying our cohort families has led us in an exciting new direction, not anticipated when we applied for the grant but ultimately much more fruitful for historical understanding.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project is now completed. Although our own database is closed, there is much more that could be done relating to the majority of the 800 families who were not investigated in depth in the final part of the study. There is plenty of scope for family historians to use our publicly available database as a point of departure and to look more deeply into the history of our cohort families using archival and other evidence, especially newspapers, wills, photographs, trade directories, Chancery records, family papers, tax records, and so on. 

Other researchers too can use our methodology to study a different middle-class cohort, one drawn from London for instance, or to study other social groups. We hope that our work will be starting point for many other longitudinal studies of Victorian and Edwardian society.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A8FE4A90-7407-4FEE-8F69-25DE3446C88F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54466e38b93722.50763284</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We currently have six separate relational databases in ACCESS format which cover the following towns: Alnwick, Morpeth, Bristol, Merthyr Tydfil, Greenock, Leeds, Winchester, Brighton and Dundee. Each database contains biographical data of a sample of professional men drawn from the 1851 census, plus three generations of their family: their parents, children and grandchildren. We now have information on about 15,000 individuals. In the first two years of the award, we primarily utilised the online databases such as Ancestry. In the past year this information has been refined and expanded using a variety of additional sources, such as trade directories, wills, newspapers, rate books, local societies' papers and personal papers. We have concentrated our attention in the last year on a selection of families, whose profile was representative but about whom there is much more extant information. As a result, we have now enough information about some families such as the Wickhams of Winchester (a family into which one of Gladstone's sons married) to allow us (if we wish) to write stand-alone monographs once the book of the project is complete. This additional data is held both in separate WORD files and in the Notes field of the databases. Inputting data into the databases has now effectively come to an end. For the last two months of the grant, an additional RA paid by the hour has been going through each database and cleansing the data of typographical errors, and ensuring the occupations stated in the Occupation field correspond to the protocols devised by Kevin Schurer and Eddie Higgs for their i-cem census data/standardisation project. This will ensure the data in this crucial field in robust and make the data easier to use by academics. Data about county of birth and death have also been standardised according to the pre-1974 borders and for London the borders of the old LCC.

This data is then linked directly to our project website which allows the general public to move around all the members of the family group and access their biographical details. ORDS was fully functioning from the summer of 2015 and we continued to update the data relating to our project into this data storage facility until the summer of 2016. Unfortunately in the summer of 2016 the University of Oxford decided to cease funding ORDS with the result that from the summer of 2017 the data structure will no longer exist. Over the last few months, the Oxford IT department has been creating a new data structure to host our data and link with our website, so that the public can still access a significant portion of our data and make contact with us pertaining to our cohort. This new data structure and interface will be ready for testing by the end of March and we expect to go live in April, long before ORDS is taken down.</gtr:description><gtr:id>48C8DBB7-C214-423B-A5B0-A0CA65CC2BB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following the activation of this research tool, family historians have been able to search our uploaded data through the web and have provided us with additional information.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5446664b34bcc0.26419753</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The ORDS</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.victorianprofessions.ox.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005138/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
