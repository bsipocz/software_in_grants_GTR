The divided city is most clearly seen in the deeply embedded strength of residential segregation and separate schooling that represents separate and competing concepts of communal affiliation. Institutional structures designed to deal with violent conflict between nationalists and unionists have increasingly been based on recognising and accommodating the distinct national and cultural identities and needs of the two 'communities'. Yet, while it is easy to assume that political mobilisation coheres with ethnic community in the divided city, Belfast has a long and rich history of non-sectarian groups mobilising to advance alternative politics and contrasting visions of communal belonging which embrace diverse identities and political goals. Examples of these non-sectarian movements include Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender groupings, punks, feminists, socialists, environmentalists, anti-nuclear groups and anti-global capitalist movements. 

This project seeks to bring to wide attention the history and narratives of these non-sectarian movements by examining the extent these groups forge plural communities that purposely supersede ethnic identity. By illuminating the contingent and multiple ways in which the political community is imagined, challenged and constituted, the project aims to address a crucial gap in research on community in divided societies. In particular, the project looks at how non-sectarian movements have potentially fostered community identity through ritualistic performance, especially street protests, theatre and art, and the carnivalesque. Alongside this, the project examines how groups which do not historically belong to specific residential spaces, or are effectively excluded from key symbolic public spaces, creatively utilise space to create communal belonging and identity. Furthermore, the project will aim to bring new depth to our understanding of why individuals choose to opt out of traditional ethnic communities by joining non-sectarian movements in the divided city. It will also explore how diverse non-sectarian movements have created networks and strong relationships of support between each other.

It is expected that this project will have a high academic and public policy impact. It will appeal to academics who wish to examine the complex character of communal mobilisation in divided cities, and it is hoped that it will initiate similar research on alternative modes of community in similar violently divided cities as well as comparative work. The research will also be of great benefit to public policy makers, especially in Belfast and across Northern Ireland, which are responsible for institutionally supporting and funding community development as part of peacebuilding strategies. The project will not only bring together non-sectarian social movement representatives and public policy makers to debate the meaning and salience of community in the context of a divided city; it will further contribute to an important deliberation over how community should be defined for the purposes of institutional classification and support and which communities should merit such support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Third sector, including non-sectarian social movements:
Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association
Northern Ireland Committee for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions
Anti-racist Network Northern Ireland
Belfast Pride Festival

Other Third Sector
Healing Through Remembering (an NGO dedicated to dealing with the past in Northern Ireland)

Policy-makers, within international, national, local or devolved government
Belfast City Council (organisation responsible for the city's public policies, including arts and culture)
Community Relations Council, Northern Ireland (funds arts and culture initiatives designed to improve community relations between groups)
Office of the First Minister Deputy First Minister (the executive regional government in Northern Ireland, responsible for many public policies for the wider region)

Wider public
People who the social movements represent, such as gay, lesbian and bisexuals, trade unionists and migrant workers

How will they benefit from this research?
Third sector, including non-sectarian social movements:
Non-sectarian social movements will benefit from a project that collates, synthesises and publicises their histories to public policy makers and the wider public. The research will specifically create a roundtable discussion in which social movement representatives and public policy makers can discuss the character of community in Belfast, and how public institutions should deliberate on classifying and supporting community development projects. Thus, it is hoped that these non-sectarian movements can use the research and the engagement with public bodies to present their views on how street arts and ritualised performances from a diverse range of groups can contribute to projects that tackle sectarianism and promote intercultural relations. It is also possible that the research, which will be publicised, will help groups in outreach work with the public.

Policy-makers, within international, national, local or devolved government
Policy-makers, especially government and public institutions in Northern Ireland, require research and analyses of 'community' so that they can correctly allocate resources to community development projects. As 'community' in Northern Ireland is profoundly seen as signifying homogenous 'nationalist' or 'unionist' communities, by demonstrating the sheer diversity of communal identities, practices and projects that cannot be easily categorised as 'ethnonational', the research will assist with the need to both contest the idea of ethnic community and to orient the concept of community to new opportunities. Since the project provides scope for a roundtable discussion between public policy makers and social movement representatives, it will allow for public agencies to consult the views of social movements on the variety of community expressions in the city; it will also allow them to gain more information about how to recognise and institutionally fund community development projects. It is hoped that the project, especially through the research and the roundtable discussion, will provide scope for a better engagement between social movements and public bodies and even potentially feed into public policies. These policies will include those oriented towards gay and bisexual rights, migrant communities and multiculturalism, street art, anti-sectarianism and even alternative politics.

Wider public
This project will have benefit to the wider public. This will be achieved by making the research available through a website and database. It might be of particular use for social movement members wishing to explore the histories of their own movements. It may also be of use for those members of the wider public who are largely unaware of these movements or their rich histories. As such, it may provide compelling testimonies that encourage people to join or support movements.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19096</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J012289/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6C41006C-514B-4763-BE82-812123897818</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
