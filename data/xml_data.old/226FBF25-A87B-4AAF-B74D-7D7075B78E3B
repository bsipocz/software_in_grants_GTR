However, current systems are expensive, due to their use many discrete fibre optic components and complex control electronics. Furthermore, they have not yet been subject to the same scrutiny as commercial cryptographic products and are known to have potential implementation security issues. 
 
This project will address these limitations allowing commercialisation of quantum security devices and systems. It will develop innovative ideas for mass-manufactured, chip-based devices, of greatly reduced size and cost, for high rate quantum random number generation and quantum key distribution, based on manipulating the optical phase in laser diodes. These devices, along with quantum resistant algorithms, will be embedded into secure communication demonstrators and subject to comprehensive verification of their quantum and classical security. 
 
The project will deliver compact, practical prototypes for multi-Gb/s random number generation, low cost quantum key distribution and high bandwidth, low latency data encryption, demonstrate these prototypes to potential customers, and explore the market for quantum security technologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic Impact: Our approach for developing compact, high-performance quantum security devices and systems will offer a highly attractive solution for secure communications. As such the project partners expect to benefit from a major fraction of the predicted $899M market for quantum cryptography in 2020. The technology developed in the project will also have applications as communication devices in quantum computers, the market for which is predicted to be $5.5B in 2020. A successful outcome will bring benefits beyond the consortium, not least in securing the communication infrastructure of UK businesses. It will also create new opportunities for UK supplies of photonic and electronic components, areas in which the UK has a strong industrial basis. 

Social Impact: Quantum security devices and systems will be used to protect the sensitive information of UK citizens, such as financial information, health records etc and to promote the uptake of e-government and e-services. There is concern that a quantum computer would break the security of today's public key cryptography, which is widely used for on-line banking, e-commerce, automatic software updates etc. Quantum systems, the security of which are not threatened by a quantum computer, can maintain UK information security infrastructures in the quantum era. 

Environmental Impact: Quantum security devices and systems will have a strong positive environmental impact. They will encourage and accelerate the use of secure quantum networks and services, reducing dependence on travel and paper-based communications. Furthermore they will enhance the security of the smart grid, thereby accelerating its adoption and safeguarding the critical infrastructure of the UK. In the longer term they will enable the development of quantum computers operating with vastly reduced energy and resource requirements compared to conventional supercomputers. Ultimately quantum-computer-aided design and simulations are hoped to help solve a wide range of environmental and efficiency problems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156233</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R02314X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
