For the individual, the illness can disrupt a broad range of mental functions, leading to a variety of symptoms including hearing voices, suffering from unusual and pervasive beliefs which affect everyday functioning and social interaction, and problems with basic mental skills, such as memory, language and problem solving. For society, the illness represents a major social and financial cost. The treatments currently available for the disease are often only partially effective, since we know relatively little about the disturbances in the brain that lead to the symptoms of schizophrenia. 

It is therefore important to learn more about the disruptions of the function of the brain in order that more effective treatments can be developed. The extent to which the symptoms of schizophrenia can be mimicked in animals is limited, since the illness involves a disorder of functions which can be considered uniquely human. An effective strategy to investigate brain disorder in schizophrenia is to reproduce the symptoms of the illness in healthy subjects using drugs which produce similar types of experiences. This can be done extremely safely in a controlled research environment, and our research team has substantial expertise in this field. 

The development of new brain imaging techniques in the last decade has allowed scientists to examine the living human brain, as it orchestrates human thoughts and actions. In order to examine the effects that these drugs have on the brain, and how they produce schizophrenia-like experiences, we therefore propose to use these brain scanning techniques to observe the effects of the drugs in healthy subjects, and compare this with the abnormalities we see in patients with schizophrenia. 

The main objective of this project is to test whether a particular brain pathway that is thought to be important in schizophrenia is also disrupted by the drugs which reproduce some of the symptoms of the illness in healthy subjects. We aim to compare the effects of 2 drugs which both produce schizophrenia-like symptoms, but by different effects on the brain, and thereby hope to isolate the core common mechanisms. This would represent an important step in identifying the principal targets for treatment. 

The findings of this study will be made available to the public via the annual Cambridge Science Festival hosted by the University.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project is to identify the extent to which functional pathophysiology of the limbic system is common across schizophrenia and 2 pharmacological models of the illness. Theoretical accounts of schizophrenia have centred on the local responsivity of regional limbic nodes, as well as functional interactions between them. Similarly, there is extensive evidence that both ketamine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; psychoactive component of cannabis) disrupt limbic function. Using both neuropsychological and neuroimaging investigations, this project will aim to determine whether limbic dysfunction represents a core pathology across drug and disease. In addition, this information will serve to improve understanding of the increasingly prevalent issue of dual diagnosis: the comorbidity of schizophrenia and substance abuse. 

METHODOLOGY: Phase I and Phase II of the project involve a comparison of ketamine and THC in healthy volunteers. On 3 pseudorandomized study visits, participants will receive either placebo or a low dose of either ketamine (100 ng/ml) or cannabis (2.5mg) during the performance of neuropsychological tasks (Phase I) or functional imaging (Phase II). Following testing at low dose, on each visit the dose will subsequently be increased to elicit schizophrenia-like symptoms (ketamine: 200 ng/ml; cannabis: 5mg). This design allows us to determine whether behavioural/neurophysiological effects observed at sub-psychotic doses predict psychotic symptoms at higher doses. Phase I will involve a neuropsychological investigation of cognitive tasks known to involve the limbic system. In Phase II we will select a subset of these, based on the findings of Phase I, which will be performed during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to establish the degree to which regional and inter-regional limbic function is disrupted by ketamine and THC. Phase III will incorporate a 2x2 factorial design involving controls/patients, with/without personal history of recreational cannabis use. No experimental drug will be administered. Using fMRI, we will evaluate the extent of overlap between limbic dysfunction in schizophrenic patients, and the findings of Phase II, in order to determine the congruence between schizophrenia and the drugs used to model the illness. In addition this experimental design will enable us to investigate the interaction between drug and disease. 

IMPLICATIONS: This study will contribute to the identification of core pathological mechanisms, consistent across disease and drug models. This is a necessary and important step in the development of more targeted drug treatments of schizophrenia, and a greater understanding of the issue of dual diagnosis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>325023</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC TV Horizon Programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:id>6F977A80-FF3D-4710-866D-1FC69DB05892</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was interviewed and filmed for the BBC science programme, 'Horizon' in an episode entitled, &amp;quot;Britain's most dangerous drug&amp;quot;. This popular science programme covered the issue of reclassification of illicit and non-illicit substances, based on potential social and health implications each substance represented for both the individual and for society. I contributed to the section on 'Cannabis' in which the research from this project was highlighted, demonstrating that THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, has the potential to induce psychotic experiences, and that our research involved clinical studies in healthy volunteers to explore variability in individual's susceptibility to these effects, as a means to provide greater understanding of susceptibility to schizophrenia. The programme, which aired on the BBC in February 2008, generated considerable public debate, and remains available online for public viewing; the section at which the study is covered is available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v===jZ0C4Vx4Jyg&amp;amp;feature=related
