Learning and memory essentially evolved so organisms can predict appropriate responses to their environment. An important example for survival is remembering when to be afraid. Memories of fear are strong and persist over time. In this manner, they are a good system that can be modelled in rodents to test the underlying mechanisms of memory. Importantly, memory is a dynamic brain function with various stages, and memories can be modulated by targeting specific stages of the process. Like a film reel, a memory can be played out by the brain once there is a reminder (like hitting a play button). However, in certain cases the recording can be rewritten, edited to include new scenes or erased blank. When a memory is reactivated, this memory &amp;quot;reel&amp;quot; is rendered open (so-called memory destabilisation) to editing. Pharmacological approaches can be used to disrupt memory retrieval and destabilisation in order to weaken memories that are maladaptive, such as generalised fear and anxiety evoked by over-active fear memories. Animal models have provided some insights into what molecular requirements may be necessary for the retrieval and destabilisation of fear memory. At the level of the neurons, two classes of neurotransmitter receptors, the AMPAR and NMDAR have been found to play key roles in retrieval and destabilisation respectively. Despite this knowledge, the cascade of molecular signals activated by these receptors by fear memories are not yet well characterised, and such molecules may prove to be important targets for therapeutic drugs. Such signalling molecules include enzymes such as ERK that can travel into the cell nucleus and regulate genes, and in doing so change the cellular environment over the long-term as well as behaviour. Interestingly, it has been shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine is activated by a fear-inducing reminders both in humans and in animal models. Dopamine is released in the brain in response to novel and emotionally relevant stimuli, including both positive and negative. Dopamine acts via its own receptors to influence the function of AMPAR and NMDAR through complex signalling crosstalk within neurons in other processes. Could this also be a way dopamine influences memory processing once an emotionally relevant stimuli is present at memory retrieval? We have gathered data that after retrieval of a fear memory the ERK pathway is activated downstream of NMDAR. In the present proposal, we plan to investigate the role of dopamine in the retrieval and destabilisation of fear memories. We shall examine rodent behaviour to a fearful stimuli after drugs targeting the dopamine receptors have been administrated and in addition to this pharmacology work, we shall investigate the signalling that is engaged by these processes through performing biochemical analyses of brain samples. This will reveal whether dopamine modulates fear memory retrieval and/or destabilisation via an influence over AMPAR and NMDAR signalling respectively. Such findings will provide new avenues of research into whether dopamine regulating drugs could be of benefit in memory disorders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Memories are not permanently stable once consolidated; rather, when retrieval is induced by exposure to a reminder cue, the active memory is rendered labile by a destabilisation process. Memories of a fearful experience are easily acquired and persistent and can be relatively well studied using animal models. A novel therapeutic strategy is to specifically disrupt the memory, once destabilised, with the use of amnestic agents targeting specific neurochemical processes. We propose a combination of pharmacology and rodent behavioural studies to further our understanding of how to achieve diminution of intrusive and maladaptive memories, by identifying molecular mechanisms of retrieval and destabilisation of memories. Fear cues engage the dopamine system, but whereas some glutamatergic substrates involved in the retrieval and destabilisation of fear memory have been recently identified (AMPAR and NMDAR respectively), the influence of dopamine signalling on these receptors has yet to be investigated. We predict that dopamine in the amygdala, in response to fear memory retrieval, acts via its own receptors to regulate post-translational modifications of AMPAR and NMDAR. In addition to pharmacological studies of behaviour, we shall perform molecular analysis of the signalling pathways activated downstream of AMPAR and NMDAR, and how dopamine receptors may modulate them. I propose to perform pharmacological intervention and molecular-behavioural correlation experiments to examine the interactions of these neurotransmitters on the retrieval and destabilisation of fear memories. The expected results will help to define specific molecular substrates of these memory processes, and further define the dichotomy between the substrates of retrieval and destabilisation of memories. Identifying molecular markers of fear memories will lead to new insights into the basic biological mechanisms of memory and be relevant for therapeutic targets for memory disorders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Academic beneficiaries. As mentioned above, this research programme will encompass multi-level analyses from the cell to live animal that will be relevant to a wide range of neuroscientists and experimental psychologists. 2. Science outreach to the media and public. Since the sequencing of human genetic code, understand how the brain works has been posited as the next big challenge for biological science and raised public appreciation and interest. Members of our lab regularly engage with the public through communication events. Most recently I took part on a panel discussing a new memory documentary showcased this June in cinemas. Lab members have also presented and organised annual Pint of Science events in Cambridge, including this years &amp;quot;modifying memories&amp;quot; session. Dr Milton has also been contacted by radio and press such as the BBC to contribute on issues such as memory and addiction research, including podcasts for 'Naked Neuroscience' programs. In the past, members have also directly visited schools to talk to teenagers about the neuroscience of learning and addictive drugs for Brain Week. By openly discussing science through talks and exhibitions we aim to continue to generate interest in scientific research from the general public. I intend to actively commit to making press releases about the research as it's published, in line with the BBSRC policies. 3. Medical implications of the research. Complex chronic psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) require frequent treatment for relapse and cognitive behavioural therapy. PTSD is a life-long disorder and researching new treatments that will encourage healthy ageing has been identified by the BBSRC as a strategic priority of long-term benefit to the UK. Our outreach activities also help patients by creating awareness of the disorder. There are few drugs available at present to help patients but our results will lead to improved understanding of what signalling pathways are activated by retrieval of a fear memory and should form a basis for selecting new therapeutic targets for drug development. Thus, the research should save the NHS money as well as benefit patients, and it could potentially have knock-on effects for other memory disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>246575</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Detection of Mesocortin (Oxytocin) Receptor expression in the chick brain as a marker for welfare</gtr:description><gtr:id>6DB9B364-9738-4144-A637-30673DCAA986</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration can form the basis of future grants applications.
