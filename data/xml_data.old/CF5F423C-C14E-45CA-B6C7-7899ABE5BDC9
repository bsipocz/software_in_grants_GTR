&lt;p>An introductory briefing session will provide an overview of the science behind environmental hazards that threaten society today and initiate a discussion on how the risks from those hazards may be affected by global changes such as global warming and population pressures. In small groups, students will investigate one hazard through guided internet and library searches, with the aim of preparing arguments to justify allocating public resources for further study of that particular hazard. These arguments will be presented before the full assembly as a poster and an oral presentation. The full assembly will vote on which hazard is most deserving of public resources and further scientific effort.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Prizes will be awarded for the team producing the best poster and for the team presenting the most successful argument. Group topics will be chosen from wildfires, volcanic eruptions, sea-level change, meteorites, cyclones, flooding and demographic pressures that increase vulnerability to natural disasters&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>999</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Change: Global Threats</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A047AB09-6D34-42C4-B5CE-F80EBEC6F5BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Global Change: Global Threats workshop at Swansea University challenged sixth formers to investigate some of the possible consequences of global change. The workshop attracted 60 pupils from 8 schools in south Wales. Participants were divided into teams, and under the guidance of a member of staff from the Geography Department each team investigated the implications of global changes for threats to society: flooding, sea-level change, landslides, tropical cyclones, population issues, wildfires and weather extremes. After a period of research using the internet, books and journal articles, teams presented their findings as a poster and a verbal presentation, with each team making the case for public attention and funding to be allocated to the topic they studied. Participants voted the verbal presentation on flooding the most persuasive, and the poster on population was judged to be the best. Members of the winning teams were presented with a book. 



The participants gained valuable experience of working with university lecturers in a university environment, investigating issues relating to global change and presenting arguments through diverse media, and gained insight into the ways in which decisions are made with regard to scientific issues. Feedback from participants and teachers was overwhelmingly positive.

After this event, we organised two similar workshops in 2009 and 2010, including one workshop through the medium of Welsh. As a consequence of this workshop organisers have been invited to give talks at several local schools.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3727216193.19842772a90a212</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2007,2009,2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-168-26-0044</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-168-26-0044</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
