The project will establish a manufacturing facility to assemble the turbines at the Alternative Technology Centre in Hebden Bridge. The project will work with Huddersfield University to develop/refine the turbine and who will also provide a considerable and rigorous review of data from the first installations with iterative reviews and design. We will also work with them on getting the product accredited through MCS for UK and potential European market.
From this we will the have a product which is reliable, affordable and delivers a good ROI ? and simple to install, repair and operate.
The Alternative Technology Centre (ATC) have carried out a two year project, auditing the
potential for micro hydro across the South Pennines. During this project, we have visited and carried out pre-feasibility studies on over 50 sites. Many of these are small in size, capable of producing around 5 kW of electricity, which is enough to provide some contribution to a house's energy needs, but also for small scale farm use.
There are no suitable small scale turbines being produced in this country and ones that are available from abroad are generally smaller (500W to 2kW) and are not accredited under the MCS. As such they are not eligible for Feed in Tariffs.
From this, it is evident that there is a gap in the market for a UK produced, MCS approved
turbine suitable for sites such as these.
Agreement has been reached with site owners (farmers in several cases) in the upper valley, who are seeking to cut their bills and greenhouse gas emissions and generate an income. The two proposed initial test sites have been identified and the owners are happy to proceed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710150</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
