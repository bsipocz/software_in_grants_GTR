People with sight loss - in general
Local and national sight loss organisations will be acting on evidence that is routed in the experiences of blind and partially sighted respondents. The sight loss sector will become more engaged with data about the health and financial wellbeing of people with sight loss. Improved performance of sight loss organisations (more efficient, less wasteful of resource, more relevant and better informed) will enable them to better equip people with sight loss to engage with and influence local issues that are important to them. 

People with sight loss - specific
A proportion of the members of staff taking part in both the professional and workforce development will have personal experience of sight loss, as does one member of the core team. Thus all products and governance will be accessible to allow full participation. Furthermore, one unemployed person with sight loss will gain a paid job, work-related training, and a combination of skills that will enable him/her, should they want to, to continue to contribute valuable skills relevant to the future performance of the sector. 

Local organisations working in the sight loss sector 
Will benefit from being better informed about the profile and the needs of their client group, having greater authority for lobbying because they are armed with good quality evidence, better prepared to demonstrate need in applications for service funding, and having a more engaged and better connected workforce.

National organisations working in the sight loss sector
Will gain financial efficiency from being able to bring some social research work in-house, informed targeting and better specfication for any work commisioned externally, and greater connections with others using sight loss research and data.

The sight loss sector as a whole
Will gain from improved connections between organisations operating at local, regional and national levels.

NatCen Social Research 
Gains in terms of developed familarity with secondary analysis resources and a greater understanding of the research needs of the sight loss sector and third sector organisations more widely, at local and national level. Also in terms of ensuring research outputs are accessible and usable by the range of sight loss sector organisations. 

Other research providers
Academics and other research providers benefit from better specified research tenders, a developed understanding of the research needs of third sector organisations, and developed connections with others working in related fields.

Other third sector organisations
This project explicitly seeks to develop models of working that have direct relevance to promoting knowledge exchange and social research utilisation in sectors working to support other client groups.

Public sector and NHS commisioners
Will benefit from better evidenced funding applications for public services that more accuractely reflect the needs and preferances of people with sight loss.

Wider public
Campaign and awareness advertising will be better informed with authorative evidence based on existing UK research. Money donated by the public to support sight loss charities will therefore be better targetted.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55354</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Visionary</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership between the Knowledge Exchange Network project team and Visionary</gtr:description><gtr:id>64C304A8-535A-4064-BD5B-4681777007C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Informal ongoing data support provided by national representatives to local organisations; and national representaives have learnt about local data needs.

We are continuing to work together.

Together we have raised the profile of and carried out training in applying data and research on sight loss with: a) professionals working in national and umbrella sight loss organisations; b) professionals working in local sight loss organisations; c) generalist researchers; and d) a blind trainee.

We have achieved this through several strands of linked work:
i. A programme of day-long regional workshop/conferences aimed at people working at the local level, in addition to other professional development events. 
ii. Two sets of five day social research training programmes, conducted over a six-month period, with people working at the national level.
iii. Development and continuation - sustainable because integrated into Pocklington Trust and RNIB's own communication infrastructure - of a LinkedIn group providing ongoing advice and support, and an email circulation group (now with more than 7,000 registered recipients) of people who regularly receive sight loss Research News.

Through our work on this knowledge exchange grant we have learnt about the research and support needs across the range of groups of people that we were working with (at local, regional, national level; without and outside of the sight loss sector) - this has informed how we accessibly pitch and most usefully target ongoing work in this area. 

One key transferable finding for future public engagement and knowledge exchange activity has been the key importance of engaging at the LOCAL level. This came back strongly in our evaluation survey and depth interview work with participants from the regional seminars. They particularly appreciated the opportunity to develop local networks, meeting people working in related fields and in neighbouring organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- We have further work in the sight loss sector to do: promoting availability of and findings from analyses of the latest waves of key longituidnal survey datasets (including the Life Opportunities Survey, Understanding Society and the Millennium Cohort Study); updating the Sight Loss Data Tool; training more central sector professionals and conducting further professional development events; ongoing maintenance of the network; and applying learning to the support of another blind or partially sighted trainee. 
- We are also continuing to promote sight loss as an area of substantive research for generalist social researchers to address, and a topic that survey researchers should include good questions on when survey samples are sufficiently large to support this focus in analysis.
- But a key application will be to apply the model developed to other sectors, in particular working with other organisations with a research remit in different areas of the disability sector, such as hearing impairment.

Feedback so far has been extremely positive and includes: changed practice, changed awareness and greater knowledge and skills.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464c7e320e879.68330356</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is an Excel data tool created by RNIB and further refined and promoted locally through the Knowledge Exchange Network (KEN) events, in particular through the regional events where the tool's functionality for presenting (and modelling) data at the local level was show cased, feedback obtained on how to improve the Tool was collected, and local sector professionals were provided with a tailored report for the region or local authority where they work.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FCAB5C0-5FC5-46A6-A22A-4E9F70C29217</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Local organisations have feed back that improved data that is tailored to their area has helped with planning need at the local level and with making funding applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5492b22ec323a2.42468745</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Promotion and refinement of the RNIB Sight Loss Data Tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data handling &amp; control</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.rnib.org.uk/knowledge-and-research-hub-key-information-and-statistics/sight-loss-data-tool</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This grant has directly contributed to the development and refinement of the RNIB's Sight Loss Data Tool. This is a publicly shared Excel database which holds national and local data on sight loss, and enables local organisations to profile sight loss data for their own areas or regions. It provides information at a local level both about people with, and at risk of, sight loss.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6499B4A7-F387-4B0A-A08C-0E7887D8A90F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool aims to ensure that the needs of these people are taken into account by service providers whilst planning services and producing related documentation, such as the Joint Strategic Needs Assessments (JSNAs). In addition to registration data, the data tool also includes information from epidemiological sources, Hospital Episodes Statistics, NASCIS, Office of National Statistics, etc. 

The Sight Loss Data Tool is a key resource for the sight loss sector and has been used by over 3,000 individuals since it was launched in 2013. 
Stuart Clayton, the Chief Executive of Galloway's, provided the following feedback after using the Sight Loss Data Tool: 

&amp;quot;I have used the data to influence the Lancashire LEHN in the development of the sight loss pathway, the Health and Wellbeing Boards regarding the general prevalence of sight loss and in Sefton we included data in our bid to the CCG small grants programme and as a consequence we were awarded &amp;pound;40k for the development of a new early intervention project.

&amp;quot;The sight loss data tool has enabled me to speak with confidence about the prevalence of sight loss and the associated costs at recent CCG AGM's and in turn this has raised the profile of sight loss in Lancashire and Sefton. The RNIB sight loss data tool is an excellent capacity builder for organisations such as Galloway's to raise the profile of sight loss in a challenging and ever changing environment.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464bef5a81d43.71348823</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Sight Loss Data Tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.rnib.org.uk/knowledge-and-research-hub-key-information-and-statistics/sight-loss-data-tool</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002000/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2093C2F8-C10A-40EE-A71D-387F3BA92968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Kinship Health &amp; relatedness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>189E1F60-BF95-405D-A6F0-62BBD78E2DD5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Survey &amp; Monitoring</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
