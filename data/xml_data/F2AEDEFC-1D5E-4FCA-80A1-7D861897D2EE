The story of Amelia Earhart who disappeared in 1937 while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, is used to communicate key mathematical concepts of Poincar&amp;eacute; Conjecture, which uses mathematical journeys to explore a shape that's impossible to see from the outside e.g our universe. As two of the most engaging puzzles of the 20th Century, the stories of Earhart and Poincar&amp;eacute; resonate in their ability to capture our imaginations and lead us to new conceptions and experiences of our world. Each is an explorer, whether actually or virtually, each in their own way seeking to transcend the earth through maps and mathematics. The project builds on a 2008 EPSRC early development project (EP/G001650/1) and is led by an interdisciplinary team the19thstep consisting of composer Dorothy Ker, sculptor Kate Allen and consultant mathematician Marcus du Sautoy. My role in the project was co-deviser of a piece of music theatre Amelia and the Mapmaker with Dorothy Ker, I designed the set, props/object including the challenge of representing a 4 dimensional map of the universe in 3D, a series of projections using computer programme Isadora, and costumes. I also co-devised with Topologist Katie Steckles the audience participation workshops. The theatre piece Amelia and the Mapmaker runs for 65mins is performed by percussionist Chris Brannick as the Mapmaker, mezzo soprano Lucy Stevens as Amelia Earhart and sound designer Kelcey Swain as the Library. The outputs so far are performances targeting arts-going audiences, at the Green Man Festival, the British Science Festival, the Bob Kayley Theatre UoR and the Otley Science Festival. Each performance is accompanied with a workshop led by Topologist Katie Steckles.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD226B66-0711-4B9D-B30C-1E41419AD745</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Led to development of Amelia and the Mapmaker http://ameliaandthemapmaker.com</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ea05f2ac096.57431119</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Everything and Nothing Collaborative Research Group</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://everythingandnothingproject.blogspot.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Young people living in Barton East Oxford inscribed their names into the render on a wall in Barton in 2004.

The wall took on further significance as one of the young people, Kyomie, who worked on the project and signed the wall, has since died.

Some of the young people suggested creating a partner smiley wall on the other side of shops that would be pink. There was a real sense of ownership of the wall and its importance to the community as focal point.

The project is significant in its timely relation to contemporary mathematics and arts-science themes delivering narratives that weave together to take audiences on a unique multidimensional journey of the mind and senses, creating entrance points for the public to challenging mathematical concepts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FF38C73B-9C48-43CA-B4C6-43F87D5CC17E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545e92f7189a71.45520381</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Grant founded ?the19thstep?, a dance performance dialogue between composer Dorothy Ker, mathematician Marcus du Sautoy, and choreographer Carol Brown and myself, which explored ideas of mathematics, infinity and the shape of the universe through the writing of Jorge Luis Borges.
