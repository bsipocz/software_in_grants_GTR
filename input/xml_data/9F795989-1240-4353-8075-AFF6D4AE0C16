We have developed and tested dozens of assistive robots, for both cognitive and physical assistance. Over the course of the AAL-DOMEO project, which was coordinated by Robosoft, we accumulated over 700 days of experiments with real dependent patients. Through this work and these experiments Robosoft has built up extensive experience in the field of assistive robotics, but we also now have, most importantly, a clear vision for how to approach the market in the short term. In fact, despite robots being very promising, it is still a challenge for potential users to distinguish between the dream and the reality of what is actually possible.
Thus we share fully in the fundamental premise of the PCP-Silver project; that robots are likely to be most useful to the assistance professionals themselves. Dependence is a major issue in today?s society, for which a new ecosystem needs to be created. One that brings together all of the industry?s professionals. With ever increasing needs and ever scarcer resources (i.e. caregivers), there is a need to provide productivity tools to professionals while improving the quality of life of those affected.
We have based our project on this reasoning by proposing a two-pronged approach: 
- A modular robot configured in line with the type and degree of dependence, but one that can also change over time along with the status of the person. This robot includes an autonomous base platform, comprising of a cognitive assistance system and a medication management carousel system. Expansion modules can be added, such as the walking aid, position change assistance (standing, sitting) and handling systems.
- A communication environment, in the form of a secure website that allows the ecosystem to access the dependent person, but also allowing the dependent person to remain in constant contact, in a simple and effective way. This provides both social links and a sense of security. 
We believe that robots are not replacements for people, but there to help. Work in the dependence field will become more professional, without which it would be impossible to effectively meet the demand. As such, robots will become a productivity tool for caregivers, but also for all stakeholders in the ecosystem.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971343</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
