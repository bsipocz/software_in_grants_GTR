Auralisation is based on obtaining the acoustic room impulse response (RIR) of a space, through measurement if the building already exists, or otherwise via simulation using computational modelling. The result is a 3D acoustic rendering of any sound we wish to hear within the auralised environment. This research plays a key role in architecture, environmental noise assessment, recreating past environments in digital heritage, as well as enabling creativity in music production, broadcast and computer gaming.

The WEb Audio Virtual Environment Rendering (WEAVER) project will revisit the concept of spatial audio composition and rendering in relation to the last ten years of development in auralisation and virtual acoustics research. Since this research started in 2004, the specialised audio technology required to explore spatial composition using virtual acoustics, auralisation, acoustic measurement and modelling is now commonplace in most creative computer music software applications. Acoustic RIR measurements from various sites, buildings and venues, many of significant heritage value or interest have also been gathered and disseminated over this ten-year period via the online Open Acoustic Impulse Response Library (OpenAIR: www.openairlib.net). Over this time OpenAIR has become a key resource for electronic musicians, sound designers, software and computer game developers.

Much of the functionality required to explore and audition spatial audio content and virtual acoustic environments can now, in fact, be offered via a standard web browser and mobile device - additional acoustic RIR data is still needed to auralise these virtual spaces, but the ability to use or listen to these results is now carried by millions of potential users worldwide. 

WEAVER will use the Web Audio API to deliver interactive virtual acoustic environments via a web browser, and to further realise some of the creative research aims first articulated over ten years ago. In combination with the research and resources related to OpenAIR, that was also an outcome from this initial work, WEAVER will develop impact and engagement in online sonic art, digital heritage and broadcast.

WEAVER will create novel online sonic art from OpenAIR data. We will scope the Web Audio API to detail its capabilities for developing creative virtual acoustics applications informed by existing examples and current practice, and provide a route to impact through the development of new user contacts for OpenAIR content.

We will work with York Theatre Royal, a regional producing theatre based on a historic site that has hosted a working theatre since 1744, to develop a web resource to engage new audiences with the redevelopment and heritage of the theatre's auditorium space. This presents a unique opportunity to apply our virtual acoustics research in a culturally and historically significant venue during its refurbishment. We will help York Theatre Royal to tell their story and engage new audiences using our expertise in acoustic heritage, auralisation and sound design, brought together through the development of novel, interactive online content.

With BBC Audio Research we will investigate how virtual acoustic rendering informs the experience of listening to audio broadcast material. WEAVER will expand on existing BBC spatial audio rendering for broadcast to include differently rendered virtual acoustic and playback listening environments, and will make use of BBC facilities and test platforms for reaching audiences in order to gain feedback on the effectiveness and future viability of this presentation technology.

At all stages data and code developed will be disseminated by open-source/open-access means, encouraging maximum potential impact for WEAVER and the resources it creates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The WEAVER follow-on project will build on research in spatial audio composition and rendering by using the Web Audio API, together with OpenAIR data, to deliver interactive virtual acoustic content for the web, so developing new pathways to impact and engagement in online sonic art, digital heritage and broadcast. The main WEAVER beneficiaries are the partners who have shaped its content and direction.

York Theatre Royal (YTR) will use audio/image data, as gathered from the current theatre space throughout the existing refurbishment and beyond, to animate the history of the building and the site. The digital heritage community, both researchers and those managing museums, galleries and heritage sites, will also benefit from the learning developed from the design of the online materials for engagement that will be produced from this partnership. 

WEAVER will enable BBC Audio Research to enhance their existing spatial audio rendering applications to include virtual acoustic and multiple playback options. Through our partnership we will further promote this work to the relatively new Web Audio community, who have recently hosted their first international conference with the BBC already active as contributors.

Additionally, audiences for both YTR and BBC will benefit from the enhanced opportunities that will be offered through WEAVER to digitally engage with the creative content that these organisations curate and deliver.

The wider creative music technology community will also benefit from outputs produced in terms of the novel sonic art created, code developed and RIR data that will be curated and made available online via OpenAIR.

OpenAIR has already created impact in computer music, digital heritage and computer gaming. WEAVER will also deliver impact in the area of computer music, extending to the web developer community through the novel use of OpenAIR data and the Web Audio API. Both data and code developed will be made open-source/open-access, encouraging maximum potential impact for WEAVER and the resources it creates. As the Web Audio community is relatively new, there is a good opportunity to make an early contribution to the field with lasting impact.

WEAVER will enhance the offering and potential audiences for our two high profile partners through the novel online content created. YTR and the BBC are part of the UK's Creative Industries, a socially important, export driven industry, and one of the UK's leading industrial sectors. Digital technology increasingly helps to drive the creative industries, and interactive digital media is becoming more important in conveying narrative and factual entertainment to audiences. Collaborating with our partners at this early stage in Web Audio's development maximizes the potential impact for our work given the national reputation of YTR and the global reach of the BBC. York has recently been designated as UNESCO City of Media Arts, providing an umbrella under which the collaboration with YTR has additional opportunity to make a global impact, with related benefit to the local, regional and UK economy. 

Impact developed with YTR will become more beneficial as the theatre reopens in late 2015/early 2016, and starts on the next phase of its own development. WEAVER is also planned to start then, and benefits should be evident within the timescale of the project into the medium term. Integrating with the BBC's online technology will enable WEAVER outputs to deliver impact into the future based on their wider use and rollout. The Audio Research Partnership encourages further collaboration beyond the project timescale and joint dissemination to audiences in academia and industry is anticipated.

The project RA will develop professional skills in audio, web authoring and coding through engagement with the requirements of our two partners, coupled with a valuable industry placement with the BBC that will further opportunities for them across employment sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75351</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Theatre Royal York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>York Theatre Royal</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D2AEE53-8421-46A1-8C2B-CA152B551D41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To date, this partnership has helped to inform and resulted in two funded grant applications:

In particular this project investigated the Web Audio API as a means to deliver such interactive virtual environments using a web browser. The project was funded as a Follow-On project for Impact and Engagement, so was entirely focused on realising impact from our findings via our project partners York Theatre Royal and BBC (Audio) R&amp;amp;D.

We captured 360-degree image and audio data from different seat locations across the York Theatre Royal auditorium for a single on-stage performance. This audio-visual data was then combined into a test web-page viewer to enable a user to view the performance from each seat location. We have used this as an example of Virtual Box Office technology for York Theatre Royal, to encourage potential audience members to buy tickets for a show or upgrade their seat, or as a test for VR-based streaming of a performance. We are in the process of gaining feedback from this application from box-office visitors, in order to evaluate its use, and will present this at a conference focusing on VR and live performance venues later in 2017 where we will have the opportunity to present this concept to a wider audience or professional practitioners and venue managers.

We have worked with our project partners at BBC Audio R&amp;amp;D to develop a Web Audio framework that enables OpenAIR data to be delivered to third party applications in a standardised way. This is part of an open-source library that has been published and documented in a paper for the Audio Engineering Society 142nd Convention in Berlin in May 2017, using novel online sonic art as a means of demonstrating its functionality. This Web Audio library is open-source and will be used by BBC R&amp;amp;D, and through its open-source license, potentially a significant part of the wider audio community.

This project also facilitated three-way collaboration between the University of York, BBC R&amp;amp;D and York Theatre Royal - the BBC are researching the use of 'Venue Explorer Technology' making use of hi-definition broadcast to enable viewers to focus on one particular element of a wider scene (e.g. a stadium sports event, concert, or music festival). The WEAVER project enabled all three parties to develop into this area through the use of York Theatre Royal performances as small Venue Explorer Case studies. To date, filming has been completed for two performances and we are looking for means of developing this opportunity further. 

We will develop our virtual box office and venue explorer concepts further through the DC-Labs project (EP/M023265/1) to see how they might be leveraged as a useful tool for performing arts venues and for broadcast. The learning we have developed in terms of delivering 360-degree visuals and sound for web or VR is being used by both DC-Labs in a project on 'Virtual Vikings' for a major exhibition at York Museums Trust in 2017, and has also helped to found a new AHRC project exploring the acoustics of the historic House of Commons Chamber (AH/P012094/1).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>17BEB964-1AA6-4079-A3FE-3651F73E8076</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c2dd7578df64.02866829</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The WEb Audio Virtual Environment Rendering (WEAVER) project revisited the concept of spatial audio composition and sound rendering in relation to the last ten years of development in virtual acoustics and auralisation research.

This work will be presented at the Audio Engineering Society 142nd Convention in Berlin in May 2017. This work helps to demonstrate the output from (3) below.

(2) The development of an online resource to engage new audiences with the redevelopment and heritage of York Theatre Royal's auditorium space.
This involved the capture of 360-degree image and audio data from different seat locations across the York Theatre Royal auditorium for a single on-stage performance. This audio-visual data was then combined into a test web-page viewer to enable a user to view the performance from each seat location. York Theatre Royal are particularly interested in how this might develop into Virtual Box Office technology, to encourage potential audience members to buy tickets for a show or upgrade their seat, or as a test for VR-based streaming of a performance. We are in the process of gaining feedback from this application from box-office visitors, and are preparing a paper on this work for the forthcoming Web Audio Conference, later in 2017.

(3) The development and testing of virtual acoustic rendering options for BBC online streaming and audition of audio broadcast material.
We have worked with our project partners at BBC Audio R&amp;amp;D to develop a Web Audio framework that enables OpenAIR data to be delivered to third party applications in a standardised way. This is part of an open-source library that has been published and documented in a paper for the Audio Engineering Society 142nd Convention in Berlin in May 2017, using novel online sonic art as a means of demonstrating its functionality (see also (1) above).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Web Audio Library we have developed is open-source and will be used by BBC R&amp;amp;D, and through its open-source license, potentially a significant part of the wider audio community.

We are looking to develop our virtual box office project further through the DC-Labs project (EP/M023265/1) to see how it might be leveraged as a useful tool for performing arts venues. The learning we have developed in terms of delivering 360-degree visuals and sound for web or VR is being used by both DC-Labs in a project around 'Virtual Vikings' for a major exhibition at York Museums Trust in 2017, and has helped to found a new AHRC project exploring the acoustics of the historic House of Commons Chamber (AH/P012094/1).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4BB74808-45CF-477E-9D9A-361B04327671</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2dd457c4134.46053040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a Javascript library, written using the Web Audio Framework to enable OpenAir audio data from our online website (www.openairlib.net) to be used more freely in third party applications. The application receives commands from the client-side classes, performs queries on the OpenAIR internal database, formats the data and returns it to the client classes. Ultimately this library enables OpenAIR acoustic data to be easily integrated into other online applications that use the Web Audio Framework.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BCD26AF7-6F9C-4B50-9776-BAB7E4DD9D37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work was prepared in collaboration with colleagues at BBC R&amp;amp;D, with a view to being used in some of their future online broadcast work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1973e0f7f44.78080922</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>OpenAirLib</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/UoYWEAVER/OpenAirLib</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A97C4430-5A6F-43A3-A340-D4F83D66F6E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>OpenAirLib: A JavaScript library for the Acoustics of Spaces</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7748ccbafd5cd6c98a92b38913d1fe50"><gtr:id>7748ccbafd5cd6c98a92b38913d1fe50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown KI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c18eb0c9f0e3.42812954</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N00356X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
