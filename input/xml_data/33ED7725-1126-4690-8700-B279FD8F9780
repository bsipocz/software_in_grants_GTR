It may also be known as &amp;quot;cultural psychiatry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cross-cultural psychiatry&amp;quot;. It is a field in which medical science and the humanities (particularly anthropology) have collaborated since the post-war period, and it is growing in importance because of the encounter, diffusion, and mingling of cultures through globalising forces such as migration and the mass media. This project cultivates critical reflection upon the first principles of transcultural psychiatry, a field in which culture, as well as the brain, is understood as essential to the understanding and treatment of mental illness. The project collaborators will reflect upon a number of fundamental questions in the theory of transcultural psychiatry. For instance, do the expectations of Western psychiatric culture mould the shape of mental illness in Western European and North American contexts? Why are certain kinds of behaviour or experience (for example, hearing voices, seeing dead loved ones) understood as harmless in certain culture contexts, and as a sign or symptom of mental disorder in others? If unusual or peculiar behaviour is understood as normal or healthy for a particular culture, then is psychiatry also taking part in the contemporary politics of identity, in which cultural difference is recognised and validated? The project will be conducted amongst a number of clinical and academic collaborators, from a variety of institutions and disciplines. They will debate via an on-line forum hosted within a blog, to which they will be encouraged to also contribute content. Further reflection will take place at two face-to-face workshop events, where the collaborators will have a chance to meet in person, make presentations (which may be podcasted), and engage in live discussion. The academic and clinical community, and the wider public, will learn about the project via the blog and website, and through synergies with other research and knowledge exchange initiatives. It is hoped that reflective issues developed in the forum and workshops will impact not only research, but also the practice of mental healthcare in diverse cultural contexts, including not only non-Western cultures, but also subcultures (for example, of religion or ethnicity) within Western culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most immediate professional users of the research will be clinicians within psychiatry, clinical psychology, and the various forms of counselling and psychotherapy, particularly those who are active in culturally or ethnically diverse communities. The project will also impact mental health nursing, psychiatric social work, and other professions that support the mentally ill. Mental health service users will also be informed by the project's results. They are represented by a variety of formal advocacy groups in the UK, including MIND/Diverse Minds, Rethink, SAMH, Hearing Voices Network, Critical Psychiatry Network, and so forth. The project will also allow for the emergence of unforeseen stakeholders in the research.
By eventually having an impact upon both professional and user groups, it is hoped that this project will to some extent shape and enhance public mental health services (and, indeed, private ones such as counselling and psychotherapy), and thereby potentially contribute to the nation's health.
It must be noted that the impact effect is at this stage difficult to define, and likely to be fully manifested in the longer term, and perhaps also through synergy with future research. The research impact will be a heightening of reflexivity within transcultural mental health provision, and a critical unsettling of what may be problematic assumptions concerning (for instance) cultural causation, the neutrality of Western culture, the reality of diagnostic categories, cultural belonging, and the recognition of identity.
