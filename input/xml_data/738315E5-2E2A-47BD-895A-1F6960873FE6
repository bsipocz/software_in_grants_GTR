They are used to standardise vocabularies (e.g. biologists use taxonomies to organise species into broader categories such as family and order), and to categorise content such that it can be more easily searched (e.g. librarians assigning categories from a taxonomy to books). While taxonomies are traditionally the result of a careful and time-consuming manual process, recent developments in the world wide web have led to a proliferation of taxonomies of a more informal nature. Online retailers such as Amazon, for instance, organise their products using an ad hoc taxonomy, which reflects how customers use their website, rather than any commitment on the semantics of the underlying product categories. Similarly, applications such as Foursquare allow users to contribute to a taxonomy of place types.

While these informal taxonomies are useful to organise online content (e.g. products on Amazon, or venues on Foursquare), they are often of poor quality, and difficult to reuse among different applications. Moreover, like traditional taxonomies, they focus on a very limited set of semantic relations; usually only the relation &amp;quot;is a sub-category of&amp;quot; is considered. In contrast, in practice the semantic relationship between two categories may not be so clear-cut, among others because of the existence of borderline cases (e.g. should a pub which serves food be categorised as a restaurant?). Nonetheless, the widespread availability of taxonomies is of potentially great interest, provided that they can be improved using automated methods. 

The goal of this project is to study how such an improvement can be realised, by statistically analysing meta-data that is available on the web, and in particular from so-called Web 2.0 websites such as Flickr, where users describe photos using short textual annotations called tags.

The proposed approach is built on the idea of discovering semantic relationships between categories by statistically analysing such meta-data. On the one hand, these relations will encode information about typicality and similarity. To see why such relations are useful, consider an application which allows a user to search for restaurants in Cardiff. The search engine may rank venues of type &amp;quot;restaurant&amp;quot; by taking into account features such as distance to the city centre and average ratings (if available). However, as another criterion, one would also want to see &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; restaurants before venues such as breakfast places, coffee houses, or pubs, which may be considered as restaurants, broadly speaking, but are not what users would typically be interested in when querying about restaurants. Similarly, when the user's query asks about &amp;quot;Sichuan restaurants in Cardiff&amp;quot;, and no such restaurants are known, instances of the most similar categories may be shown instead (e.g. Cantonese restaurants). 

On the other hand, the relations that are discovered will also encode information that can help us to pinpoint likely errors in existing taxonomies and that can help us to merge different taxonomies to get a single coherent view of a given domain. In particular, these relations will allow us to detect irregularities in existing taxonomies. For example, given the assumption that similar categories usually have similar properties, and the knowledge that Cantonese and Sichuan restaurants are very similar, a taxonomy in which Cantonese and Sichuan restaurants are both sub-categories of Chinese restaurants will be considered more regular than a taxonomy in which they have different super-categories.

Our approach is unique in its data-driven approach to enrich taxonomies with semantic relations for common-sense reasoning, as well as in the proposed methods for repairing and merging existing taxonomies. Regarding applications, the results of this project will form a crucial stepping-stone towards more intelligent search engines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short term, the outcomes of this project will benefit academic researchers (as outlined in the &amp;quot;academic beneficiaries&amp;quot; section), as well as companies who rely on taxonomies (e.g. to support Web 2.0 applications). As a direct result of this project, a new taxonomy of place types will be made available, which will be of interest to companies working in the broad field of geographic information retrieval. Because of the software that will be made available, companies who rely on taxonomies of different domains will also be able to improve them with minimal effort, provided that sufficient information about the considered domains can be found on the Web 2.0. For instance, using this software, taxonomies of music genres could be improved using data from Last.fm, while taxonomies of research topics could be improved using data from Bibsonomy.

In the long term, the methods that will be developed during this project will serve as a stepping stone towards more intelligent web search. While the successes of using taxonomies for classical bag-of-words based web search has been mixed, several developments are going on in the field of information retrieval for which access to high-quality taxonomies is increasingly important. One example is question answering, with the recent success story of IBM Watson, where taxonomies play a crucial role in assessing whether a candidate answer is meaningful (i.e. of the right semantic type). Another example is semantic search, which tries to find answers to a user's query by exploiting machine readable assertions that are available on the web, encoded in standardised languages such as RDF(S) or OWL that have a formal semantics. A crucial problem for semantic search is linking assertions that have been provided by different sources. The methods that will be studied for merging taxonomies in this project will form an important part of the solution to this problem.

Note that the conceptual relations that will be induced during Phase 1 of the project are not only useful for improving taxonomies, but may open the door to practical applications of common-sense reasoning approaches that have until now only been studied at the theoretical level. By making these conceptual relations available on the project website, we will enable researchers working in this domain to more easily evaluate their methods in an experimental setting.

This project addresses one of the core challenges of EPSRC's cross-ICT priority TI3: &amp;quot;Towards an Intelligent Information Infrastructure&amp;quot;. It relates to the themes &amp;quot;Digital economy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Information and communication technology&amp;quot;, and belongs to the intersection of the research areas &amp;quot;Artificial intelligence technologies&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Information systems&amp;quot;.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>visit BBC news labs</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C1B1FD22-136C-4973-B77C-B664DB801311</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We visited the BBC's news labs to talk about possible applications of the project that would help journalists.

For example, from a collection of film reviews, our method can detect important semantic relations between films (e.g. film1 is &amp;quot;more violent than&amp;quot; film2). It is important to emphasise that the method is entirely unsupervised, i.e. all that is needed is a suitable collection of text documents.

We have then shown how the learned semantic relations can be used for improving taxonomies (e.g. automatically extending or merging existing taxonomies). This has required us to develop a number of new classifiers, which are based on the considered semantic relations. These classifiers all have the property that they simulate some form of commonsense reasoning. A key advantage of our methods is therefore that they are transparent, i.e. that the system can explain to users in an intuitive way why a certain conclusion is believed to be true (e.g. why a certain entity is believed to belong to a given category).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work from this project is being taken forward in the following three domains.

The project has led to a successful application of an ERC Starting Grant, which used the outcomes of the EPSRC project as a proof of principle. This has played a key role in convincing the panel of the feasibility of the proposed project. In this project, our findings will be extended and applied to semantic web search.

Second, we are working on applying the developed methodology to obtain descriptions of the natural environment from the tags that users provide on photo-sharing websites on the web. The resulting descriptions would be of great value to ecologists, as they would capture aspects of the environment that are difficult to obtain using traditional methods.

Finally, the project has led to a new collaboration with the School of Architecture. The idea of this research will be to derive methods for commonsense reasoning about architectural design projects, with the aim of making architectural software more designer friendly.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F01F22B7-EF95-4CA8-A888-E10D8B72A621</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447e1b4608440.03590537</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ACDC16EC-ADD3-42A7-A8F4-71E3453B9B71</gtr:id><gtr:title>Commonsense reasoning based on betweenness and direction in distributional models</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5b08c47c41f7786766d762df84b48c1a"><gtr:id>5b08c47c41f7786766d762df84b48c1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Steven Schockaert</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b86f34527336.86458672</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>62502973-2AC8-4B31-BFC6-1D923BE8DBDB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Realizing RCC8 networks using convex regions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Artificial Intelligence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c06d05334cbcebf739fbf00f55cd1fc0"><gtr:id>c06d05334cbcebf739fbf00f55cd1fc0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schockaert S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f975975accbd18</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9EC8F940-D6EA-4612-B668-7E7506037CC6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inducing semantic relations from conceptual spaces: A data-driven approach to plausible reasoning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Artificial Intelligence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/05284832174ed92ee540f4873d4063f2"><gtr:id>05284832174ed92ee540f4873d4063f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Derrac J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f390485b0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08713A39-FF7C-4D09-AF7F-244A6EA23B53</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterising semantic relatedness using interpretable directions in conceptual spaces</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c7a89e54574383ba45e52ccbad079be4"><gtr:id>c7a89e54574383ba45e52ccbad079be4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>J.
