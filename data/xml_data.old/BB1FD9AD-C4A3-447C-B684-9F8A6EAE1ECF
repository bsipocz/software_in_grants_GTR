More specifically, the research seeks to examine Amber's internal philosophy, organisation and modes of working, assess the changing nature of their body of filmic and photographic representations in light of the fragmentation and decline of local working class communities, and finally, explore to what extent the Collective is a model for developing alternative arts provision and community participation.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79218</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our impacts on Amber itself are varied and were conveyed through various forums. For example, our analyses of their organisational origins, imprinting and cultural labour, fed back directly into their recent debates about restructuring into a Community Investment Company or CIC (their first real organisational change since 1974), which explicitly discussed research findings concerning new recruitment, egalitarian decision making and norms of labour contribution. Additionally, and perhaps somewhat inadvertently, the research may have also contributed in a small way to the reinvigoration of Amber's profile through interviews with a wider variety of stakeholders, which highlighted their historical importance and contrasted their unique collective model, social concerns and longevity with the uncertainty and precariousness of the film industry today. For instance, shortly after interviewing a key commissioning figure about the collective, Amber coincidently received film development money from Channel 4 for a new film project for the first time since the early 1990s. Research findings relating to Amber's model of cultural labour, are also significant for assessing the insecure work and livelihoods of young film makers in the region, not to mention the strategies of key stakeholders such as the arts and entertainment union BECTU, film producers, and commissioning bodies. Finally, findings relating to various issues relating to the navigation of the cultural economy, including alternative organisation, different modes of working, collective modes of ensuring survival, regional cooperation and issues of cultural valuation, are of significant import to wider policy debates about the future of regional and national film production.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>71314DB6-B6F0-4E6C-9AD8-A92D4904B3A1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54624825b31799.57018726</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our overall research paradigm, and empirical demonstration of it, points to the importance of 'founding moments', 'institutional contexts' and 'organisational imprinting' in understanding an alternative arts group like Amber (i.e. how oppositional bodies like it are historically formed and institutionally shaped, and how these social processes become inscribed and reproduced). Inherent within this novel social science approach to the art,s are a number of more specific key findings. First, an important output concerns our understanding of the formation of alternative arts organisations and movements (like the UK oppositional film movement), not through an aesthetic focus on artistic style (i.e. documentary or social realism), but rather through the lens of social movement theory. In particular (see 1st nominated paper below), we look at concepts like cultural opportunity, mobilisation structures and framing to explain the early formation and organisational dynamics of Amber. A second key finding impacts on the cultural labour/ artistic livelihoods debate: instead of the familiar emphasis on the insecure, de-politicised world of cultural work, we highlight how Amber's cultural labour was predicated on collective forms of security and dedicated to the establishment of gift economies and alternative cultural institutions (see 2nd nominated paper below). Other significant empirical contributions currently being turned into outputs (i.e. journal articles in process), involve contrasting Amber's collective goals and social economy strategies with more contemporary individualist coping mechanisms in areas such as artistic entrepreneurship and innovation, cultural valuation, art and the significance of 'place', and organisational imprinting.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although we feel that the research has made significant academic as well as social impacts, its short (one year project) and small-scale nature (a small grant studying a single, yet highly significant arts organisation), means that while these have been in proportion to the project aims, we feel that there are a range of significant potential impacts still to come. For instance, we have in progress a number of journal articles focusing on important topics such as the forms of social/ cultural entrepreneurship employed by an oppositional arts organisation; the significance of 'place' and organisational imprinting on cultural formation; and how alternative cultural valuation circuits (emphasising social and community benefits and not just commercial value) underpin important transformations in cultural fields. Additionally, our plan of bringing together of all of this material, plus our existing work on social movements and cultural labour, into a single monograph, has the increased potential for setting out an academic and political argument about the wider transformative potential which an oppositional arts can have in society. Such a book would have the potential to impact not only on academic arguments and debates, but would seek to make a critical contribution to ongoing national and international debates about the role the arts can play in stimulating emancipatory social change, enhancing human creativity and achieving egalitarian objectives. We plan to submit a book proposal to a relevant publisher, following the publication of two more journal articles in addition to the two already submitted.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>43530A61-4C1D-4EF6-AEDC-7A92B393EA67</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546248a5a6d9b7.36733591</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C11C7691-A9B1-4E95-92B6-55246A7B7779</gtr:id><gtr:title>Place imprinting and the arts: A case study of the Amber Collective</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Local Economy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/50b2643c0cee4d7d218cdd987d18b68b"><gtr:id>50b2643c0cee4d7d218cdd987d18b68b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hollands R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56a745b9c3cd36.84775180</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/F042310/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-2863</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
