The mathematical study of singularities involves algebraic geometry. This is a branch of geometry which involves writing equations for the geometrical spaces of interest. For example, the cusp curve is described by the equation y^2=x^3 in the plane. For algebraic geometers, singularities appear naturally when you try to classify all the possible spaces you can write down via equations (the efforts to carry out this classification go by the name of &amp;quot;the minimal model program&amp;quot;).

I am proposing a new way to study singularities. If you deform the equation (for example you study y^2=x^3+t for some constant t) you can sometimes smooth out the singularity, but the smoothed space can have highly nontrivial topology (you can see this happen if you tilt your coffee cup into the light). This new piece of topology, which is crushed back down to the singular point as t goes to zero, is called a vanishing cycle. Let's suppose you want to show that two different singularities cannot form at the same time. I will try to do this by showing that the vanishing cycles cannot be moved apart from one another (&amp;quot;displaced&amp;quot;). If the vanishing cycles are nondisplaceable then one or other singularity can form, but both singularities cannot form at the same time.

The difficulty in making this kind of argument rigorous is that the vanishing cycles can themselves be singular! To prove such results, I will need to develop existing techniques for proving nondisplaceability (&amp;quot;Floer theory&amp;quot;) to the situation where the vanishing cycles have singularities. These techniques should then have applications in other parts of mathematics where singular cycles play a role, for example the &amp;quot;singular SYZ fibres&amp;quot; which arise in studying the mysterious geometric duality called Mirror Symmetry (predicted by string theorists in the early 1990s and still not fully understood) or the singular limits of Lagrangian mean curvature flows in geometric analysis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal impact of the proposed research will be academic. It will have a transformative effect on the field, introducing new directions in symplectic topology: exploring links with birational geometry and pioneering new methods in Floer theory. Hopefully it will also have significant impact on the ongoing effort to understand Mirror Symmetry. Of course, the wider long-term impact of foundational research is hard to predict.

There will be an economic impact on the UK's research competitiveness. Symplectic topology is a growth area in pure mathematics, with a lot of young graduate students entering the subject. Europe and the US are effectively capitalising on this growth, but the UK is still lagging behind in terms of number of full-time researchers and postdoctoral positions in the subject.

The recent award of two $3M Breakthrough Prizes to Donaldson (who has worked on Floer theory) and Kontsevich (who made the homological mirror symmetry conjecture) have highlighted modern geometry research in the public eye. This is a great opportunity for those of us in the field to capitalise on the publicity to produce quality expository material for the general public, explaining recent developments in geometry centred around mirror symmetry and Floer theory. Part of the output of this grant will be an outreach website, including videos and blog posts explaining the background to the proposed research and why it is an important direction in current mathematics. I hope this will improve awareness and encourage young people to explore mathematics as a career option; low uptake of mathematics as a degree option is a serious issue for the UK's competitiveness both nationally and internationally.

I intend to move towards an Open Notebook model, making available much of the &amp;quot;unwritten&amp;quot; material produced in the course of research. The server hosting the outreach website will also host auxiliary output of the research (tables of data, short expository notes) which will be useful for many researchers in the field. I hope this will encourage other researchers (not only in mathematics) to adopt an open notebook model. This could have a significant impact on the way we do research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>350715</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P02095X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
