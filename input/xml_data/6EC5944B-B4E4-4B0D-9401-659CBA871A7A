Burning fossil fuels, which are generally unreactive hydrocarbons, has been the simplest way to utilise them as a resource. However, this turns them into carbon dioxide and water, increasing global carbon dioxide levels, when they could be used instead for making materials and other useful chemicals. Instead of combustion, a better way to utilise fossil fuels would involve directly transforming them into useful products. This goal has been the basis of the chemical industry for many years, but as demand increases and different feedstocks are exploited, new chemistry needs to be developed to keep pace with these changes. Hydrocarbons contain many carbon-hydrogen bonds, which are generally unreactive and difficult to exploit. Making these bonds more reactive is known as &amp;quot;C-H activation&amp;quot; and has the potential to revolutionise the way we utilise fossil fuels as a resource, allowing us to transform very unreactive compounds into more useful ones. These compounds can then be converted into essential materials, such as plastics, feedstock chemicals and pharmaceuticals, which are of much greater value than the starting materials used to make them. C-H activation typically requires a catalyst incorporating a transition metal, but as C-H activation is a relatively new discovery in chemistry, we are quite far from understanding how to improve the metal complexes which are responsible for this astounding reactivity. Therefore, this proposal will explore C-H activation chemistry which is facilitated by a completely new class of catalyst. New C-H activators will be built from three parts; a late transition-metal centre of proven use in previous C-H activation reactions, a stable supporting platform for the complex containing a cyclopentadienyl fragment and a highly unconventional part which contains a tin atom. This unconventional fragment offers a wide range of unexplored opportunities including: i) bridging modes which will bring two C-H activation centres close together, ii) the ability of the ligand to actively get involved in the reaction cycle and physically participate in bond breaking steps, and iii) exploiting hemilability, a property which can generate vacant sites next to the reactive transition metal centre and allow reactions to take place efficiently. From this research, the factors which effect C-H activation will be identified aiding the long term development of this new process into a useful tool.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will aim to benefit society by working towards more energy efficient chemical processes. Over the long term, new catalysts will be developed and this will help reduce the amount of waste generated from chemical synthesis and lower the energy costs in chemical manufacturing. This aligns with the UK government policy of making sustainable development a part of all government operations. The general public will also need to support this realignment of priorities and this project hopes to contribute to this by increasing public awareness of how chemistry affects our everyday lives in a positive way. By communicating with the public in honest and accessible ways, scientists can develop a better relationship with the public, and a well-informed public is vital if we are to make large scale changes to our patterns of energy use. 
Funding this research will also provide many economic benefits. Firstly, it will strengthen UK research into C-H activation and catalysis. The initial collaborations set out in this proposal will be developed into larger project proposals capable of securing significant additional funding that will allow the project to grow in scope and impact. Students and researchers working on the project will develop the skills and the vision to allow them to develop sustainable solutions to the many challenges that faces our society. Supporting this proposal will also act as a stepping stone to achieving greater investment from the chemical industry. With additional support from industrial experts in catalyst development, industrially relevant catalysts will be sought. Over the long term (10 - 20 years), new ways to make products which feature heavily in our everyday lives, from medicines to new plastics, will be targeted with great potential for generating money.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100183</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with the University of York</gtr:description><gtr:id>307854EE-512D-49FD-982E-27F3CA1CC3A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The additional experiments was acknowledged in our publication in Dalton Transcations: 10.1039/c5dt04060d</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56990df929ca63.13989156-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The use for one day of a 700 MHz spectrometer to help with additional NMR experiments.

It was also used as work towards a PGCAP qualification so members of staff at Heriot-Watt university also got to see it.
