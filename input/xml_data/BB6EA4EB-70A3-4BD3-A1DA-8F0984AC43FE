Commemorative-related violence, the subject of our exploratory award, remains a potent symbol of continuing divisions and has important ramifications for a society in transition. Yet an integral part of transforming this type of violence is engaging with and learning from remembrance practices that do not tend to instigate violence or those places where we found commemorative-related violence to have dissipated throughout the 'post-conflict' years. The city of Derry/Londonderry offers one such example. An outpouring of violence leading up to or following commemorative parades was commonplace throughout the peace process and in the immediate aftermath of the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, but subsided as the years progressed. Unpacking this transformation is key to formulating policies towards shared and ethical remembrance. How might the practices and processes that have occurred in spaces such as this be replicated or managed elsewhere?

This follow-on proposal emerged from the outcomes of our exploratory project, 'Place or Past?' and works from the premise that there are examples of good practice within how the past is remembered and commemorated in specific places throughout Northern Ireland. The project found that these are 'exemplary spaces' where commemorative-related violence has disappeared throughout the post-agreement years. With a view to enhance present and future practice and approaches to commemoration, our focus is not on what instigates conflict (the subject of our original project), but rather to engage with, evaluate and share the 'good' practice that has occasioned improved inter-communal relations and non-violence around commemorative activities. The overarching aim of this follow-on proposal therefore is to 'connect' commemorative communities through establishing and profiling an advocacy network of practice that is working in the 'new' Northern Ireland (through the exploitation of our existing research findings) and promote knowledge exchange between those who are involved in commemoration and remembrance and the public bodies who are tasked with responding to and managing commemoration in a post-conflict context working alongside four partners: The Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Northern Ireland Community Council and The Junction. 

The project is led by a team of interdisciplinary academics based in Northern Ireland, at the University of Ulster and Queen's University, Belfast. A series of activities including residential training courses, public engagement events, exhibits and showcases are planned for the 12 month project duration. The primary focus of these activities is to strengthen opportunities for knowledge exchange and network building beyond the academy with the ultimate purpose of transforming negative attitudes, behaviour and relationships around commemoration. A key outcome of the project is to design, establish and disseminate a toolkit for use by public bodies and community organisations. This toolkit will provide a detailed approach of how remembrance and commemoration can be both shared and ethical in its practice. 

The project is designed to create dialogue with the past, the present and the future. In developing mechanisms for network-building and knowledge exchange in the present, focused on how the past is understood and approached, this project traces a path towards less contentious, less violent and less costly commemorative activities now and in the future. In this way, the Connecting Commemorative Communities team are centrally concerned with caring for the future, through caring for the past.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect this follow-on project to benefit the following groups and users:
1)Public Sector Bodies who are partners including the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and those who are collaborators and participants in the engagement activities including the Heritage Lottery Fund, Office of the First and Deputy First Minister and Good Relations Officers across Northern Ireland; 
2)Elected representatives and political parties who are responsible for policy making and impacting public discourse about commemorative-related activities;
3)Residents and community organisations, including The Junction, affected by commemoration of local, regional and national historical events across Northern Ireland; 
4)Victims and Survivors organisations active in and affected by remembrance and commemoration processes in Northern Ireland; 
5)Practitioners involved in remembrance and commemoration including members of loyal orders, cultural and religious and sporting organisations and historical societies;
6)Professionals involved in remembrance and commemoration activities from the artistic community including artists and muralists, curators of museums, civic and public spaces and galleries; 
7)Media organisations including print, digital and visual media sources at a local, regional and national level;
8)Broader civil society and individuals affected by commemoration and remembrance activities.

Designed and prepared in partnership with public bodies and community organisations, this project ensures that there are significant and robust opportunities for short, medium and long-term impacts to emerge for the beneficiaries. We understand that impact is measured firstly by enhancing cultural enrichment, quality of life and well-being. Our project specifically works with partners to this end through public engagement activities that are designed to drive forward knowledge, skills and expertise about good practice in commemoration. Secondly, we understand that impact is measured by contributing towards evidence based policy-making and influencing public policies and legislation at a local, regional, national and international level. Through our public engagement activities and outreach at the local through to the international level, the focus is on sharing practice and developing a toolkit for public bodies. International knowledge-exchange and impact is integrated in the Brussels-based seminar at the European Peacebuilding Liaison Office, directly engaging with representatives from member state and institutions as well as peacebuilding organisations. 

Thirdly, we understand that impact can be measured by shaping and enhancing the effectiveness of public services which is at the heart of our project. Fourthly, we understand impact to be measured by transforming evidence based policy in practice and influencing and informing practitioners and professional practice. Given the three project partners from public services in Northern Ireland, the milestones of activities arranged facilitate reflection, review and integration of the specially designed toolkit. 

The benefit of the activities allow for the advocacy network to be established and nurtured over the period of one year, facilitating relationship building and networking so that professionals and practitioners can share good practice in a safe environment, free from the constraints of auditing and budgeting concerns when reporting to funders. At present this forum is not available in Northern Ireland. Finally, this project is designed to encourage reflective practice within public bodies and community organisations thus has a beneficial impact on changing organisational culture and practices. Through the Certificate for Professional Development, there is a long-term skills and knowledge enhancement for 80 people engaged in commemoration and celebration of the past in the contemporary.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77612</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This exhibit was created using artwork produced by residential workshop participants.</gtr:description><gtr:id>740ED60C-9F39-4C85-A1C7-9FE7D7D3EDEA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This exhibit was launched in the MAC Theatre in Belfast on December 8th alongside our project partners.

Our previous project had identified specific areas that had witnessed a decrease in the number of violent incidents associated with commemoration indicating a change in the dynamics of memory-work. We wanted to build an advocacy network of good practice and encourage individuals and organisations working in this field to reflect upon and share their experiences. We aspired to connect commemorative communities and promote knowledge exchange through creating opportunities for dialogue and networking between those involved in memory-work within communities and those responsible for responding to or managing it in public spaces. We did this working with our project partners (the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Department of Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council and the Junction) through an extensive series of engagement activities including residential workshops, public debates, seminars, exhibits and educational visits. 

We also wanted this project to inform policy and practice. We achieved this by producing a toolkit which has been employed by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. This toolkit consists of a series of digital stories about contentious commemorative events which will be shown to recruits who are tasked with policing and managing these events. We have through the life of the project engaged with policymakers and practitioners through a number of initiatives including providing training on the principles of shared and ethical remembering through our partner The Junction and workshops aimed at managing VUCA environments with public bodies. We have showcased our methodologies and findings in Brussels to a number of different policy audiences. This was well received.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work resonates with the challenges that many other societies face in relation to dealing with the past and this is an issue which emerged very clearly in Brussels.

These short storyboards are shown to recruits as a way of communicating narratives of the past which are often contested. Often new members of the Police Service are tasked with responding to and policing volatile commemorative events with little knowledge of the event that is being commemorated or the sensitivities or emotion surrounding it. It is anticipated that these stories will help recruits better navigate these high pressurised political and social environments.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db2fd221f1f8.55942525</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evaluating Commemorative Practice Module</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C0BD1AF-9420-46F4-A7BE-BE405E499DEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This Continuing Professional Development Programme was designed to encourage people involved in orchestrating, responding to or managing commemoration in public places to reflect an evaluate their practice.
