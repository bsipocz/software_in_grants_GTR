Late Quaternary evidence from Southeast Asia (SUNDASIA)

RESEARCH SUMMARY

Changing sea-levels have had a significant impact on human evolution and history in Southeast Asia, and continue to affect the lives of people living there today. Under glacial conditions the continent of Asia extended into the Southern Hemisphere, but up to 75% of that additional landmass ('Sundaland') becomes submerged during interglacials, making this the world's largest single area of land lost cyclically to the sea. The 3.5-year SUNDASIA project, which has already attracted &amp;pound;300,000 worth of corporate backing towards its projected c. &amp;pound;1m cost, explores how prehistoric foraging communities adapted to cycles of coastal inundation in Southeast Asia and how understanding of those processes can inform on modern responses to climate-induced rising seas. Until now, no archaeological record was sufficiently detailed for these linked topics to be researched comprehensively at a landscape scale in this region. The Tr&amp;agrave;ng An limestone massif on the southwest margin of the Red River delta, Vietnam, is the first area in the region to provide such a record and as a result has recently (2014) achieved World Heritage status. The current project synthesizes archaeological and palaeoenvironmental evidence from the last three marine transgressions: those occurring between 59,000 and c. 1500 years ago. Through its work in Tr&amp;agrave;ng An SUNDASIA will demonstrate the impact that changing sea-levels had on early socio-economic systems in the region. This is a body of data that is also highly relevant today: more than 23% of the world's population currently reside on the coast or low-lying islands. These communities face the urgent threat of climate-driven sea-level rise which is particularly acute in Southeast Asia where sea-levels are rising at a rate three times the global average. Although scientists and policy-makers are now incorporating long-term palaeo-climate recornto predictive models of climate change, almost no attention has been paid to considering how people coped with these changes in the past. Incorporating adaptive measures that permit a diverse repertoire of responses to climate-change is seen as key to the accuracy and practicality of these models, yet these measures remain poorly understood. Sea-level change and environmental diversity have been powerful drivers behind culture-economic systems for tens of millennia in Southeast Asia; its archaeological record and particularly that from Tr&amp;agrave;ng An offer enormous potential to help bridge this knowledge gap.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following are local and international non-academic beneficiaries from the SUNDASIA programme (also see PtI):

1. Tr&amp;agrave;ng An Management Board (TAMB)
The TAMB is both a direct facilitator (see CfS) and direct beneficiary of the proposed project. Requests made of the State Party by the World Heritage Committee following inscription in 2014 mean that research within Tr&amp;agrave;ng An of the type proposed for SUNDASIA is an important part of the TAMB's commitments during the property's post-inscription phase (see http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/6099/).

2. Visiting public to Tr&amp;agrave;ng An (domestic &amp;amp; international)
Tr&amp;agrave;ng An received just over one million visitors in 2011 (Tr&amp;agrave;ng An Nomination Document 2013: 142). This is expected to double by 2020. Most current visitors are domestic tourists (and pilgrims) though numbers of foreigners are increasing. Tr&amp;agrave;ng An already features strongly on international travel websites, e.g. Tripadvisor. Visitors will benefit through greater access to information about the evolution of this landscape, the history of its inhabitants and the relationship between the two.

3. Local Vietnamese people
Local people make up a large part of the staff within the Tr&amp;agrave;ng An Landscape Complex. This group will benefit directly from SUNDASIA through employment in the management and monitoring of cultural heritage sites, and conveying information as guides for visitors. Involvement in this burgeoning heritage economy will help cultivate greater personal identification with the local and national values embodied by Tr&amp;agrave;ng An.

4. Corporate and governmental stake-holders
Long-term (since 2007) collaborators in the archaeological investigation of Tr&amp;agrave;ng An have been the Xuan Truong Enterprise (a prominent local corporation), national and local government. These stake-holders will benefit from increased media exposure and revenue as a result of interest generated by the project and its link to the World Heritage status of the property. The collaborative dynamic esearch, government, tourism and industry that is backbone of work in Tr&amp;agrave;ng An also represents a model-approach to opening heritage-based economies in Southeast Asia. 

5. International organisations &amp;amp; policy-advisers
Expert advisory panels of climate scientists and economists (e.g. IPCC) are turning increasingly to deep-time climate proxies in their predictive models. As yet such models (e.g. IAMs) have a limited conception of adaptive processes and do not consider how early human groups responded to cycles of extreme climate change (CfS). In this respect, several international organisations and initiatives will benefit from the data generated by SUNDASIA about sea-level change and human responses to it (see PtI):

5.1 Past Global Changes (PAGES) (http://www.pages-igbp.org/): international scientific network coordinating and promoting research into past global change and informing strategies for sustainability.
5.2 Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) (http://www.rgs.org/HomePage.htm): one of the world's leading learned and professional bodies for promoting geography to different audiences (including policy-makers). 
5.3 International Committee on New Integrated Climate Change Assessment Scenarios (part of IPCC) (http://www2.cgd.ucar.edu/research/iconics): develops new socioeconomic scenarios on climate change mitigation and adaptation.
5.4 International Committee on Cultural Landscapes (http://ip51.icomos.org/landscapes/ also see http://whc.unesco.org/en/culturallandscape#1): examines interaction between humans and environment. 
5.5 Human Evolution: Adaptions, Dispersals &amp;amp; Social Developments (HEADS) (http://whc.unesco.org/en/heads/): highlights value of human origins to World heritage
5.6 International Geoscience Programme (IGP) 588, 'Preparing for coastal change' (http://www.coastal-change.org/): uses past coastal change to assess future impacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>741414</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Generated interested through news media, even though the project is still in its early stages.

The PI has also been contact with the Director of the World Heritage Committee, and the Co-Chair, WCPA-SSC Joint Task Force on Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IUCN) since the start of the project. Therefore, we are actively raising the profile of this research publicly and within the sphere of World Heritage.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>12AC02EF-5197-4846-B86D-88D453BF267B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b963993c10b9.77325478</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Dec. 2016: We uncovered fragmentary human remains, likely of Neolithic age, at one of the new sites we have been investigating (Hang Hanh). Initial efforts at directly dating this material (agreed with Vietnamese collaborators) has not been successful: the %nitrogen is below the required threshold. This means that radiocarbon dating will not be successful. However, we will pursue dating of this material by other means, and plan to explore the possibility of aDNA extraction from these remains as well. This material comes from people who were very likely living at the time of the mid-Holocene marine transgression episode and is therefore of considerable significance to the aims and objectives of the sundasia project. Osteoarchaeological data (bone and tooth measurements and description) have been carried out on this material ahead of further work at this site, which will take place in March-April 2017 or September 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>General information about these findings (the human remains) will likely be mentioned during a press conference in March 2017 in Vietnam ahead of the project's first workshop.
