Whilst individually these conditions are rare, the total population, and thus cumulative impact and need for specific advice and intervention, is substantial (Dodge et al., 2010). Despite the size of this unmet need, there is little evidence that it will be addressed without an initiative to increase research and actively disseminate information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this project a sustainable website resource for parents, carers and professionals caring for individuals with six rare genetic syndromes will be developed and piloted. The impact of the resource will be evaluated. The website will have the following functions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to disseminate our peer reviewed research findings to enhance knowledge, understanding and awareness of the needs of individuals with rare genetic syndromes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to provide advice and guidance to professionals regarding assessment and intervention for behaviour disorders and make available the appropriate assessment tools that we have developed during our research&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to provide accessible, syndrome specific,&amp;nbsp; information derived from our database to help identify those at risk for developing behaviour disorder.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit individuals with rare genetic syndromes and their families and carers and will be of significant interest to professionals in a range of educational and clinical settings including (among others) Psychologists, Psychiatrists, Teachers, Speech and Language Therapists, Paediatricians, Clinical Geneticists, GPs and Teaching Support Assistants. The combined membership of the family support groups associated with each of the syndromes in this project is nearly 5,000 in the UK and estimated to be 20,000 within Europe. It is reasonable to expect that each individual will be involved with between five and fifteen professionals. In the future, the list of syndromes included within the website will expand. 

The proposed website project has the potential to have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of these individuals and their families. Improving awareness, knowledge and understanding of the behavioural difficulties that are characteristic of individuals with genetic syndromes, through timely dissemination of research findings and improved access to up to date information, will facilitate greater support for families and carers. Such information will empower parents and carers to pursue the provisions that are required for their children and to overcome the barriers that they currently face with regard to accessing services (Emerson et al., 2011). This will ultimately result in improving the psychological wellbeing of parents and carers of affected individuals.

Importantly, the website will provide advice and guidance to professionals regarding how to assess and manage behavioural difficulties appropriately and will provide access to assessment tools, devised by the research team, to support this. Additionally, normative data from our unique and extensive research database will be made available which will enable professionals to identify those individuals who are at risk for severe behaviour disorder or currently showing clinically relevant levels of these difficulties. This information is not immediately available elsewhere.

This project has the potential to have much wider impact on the quality of service provision and the economic cost of supporting individuals with rare genetic syndromes. Improving knowledge and understanding of rare genetic syndromes amongst professionals and providing appropriate tools and guidance to assess these difficulties accurately will enable provision of earlier and more effective prevention, intervention and educational programmes. Crucially, this could help to reduce the need for intervention in the future when problems have escalated, resulting in less frequent need to access health services in the long term. In Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) for example, our previous reports and materials (e.g. Oliver et al., 2003, 2006, 2009) highlighting the association between gastroesophageal reflux and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) have led to a significant change in the way that SIB in CdLS is perceived by families and professionals. The CdLS Foundation UK and World Organisation now emphasise strongly early intervention for reflux in CdLS and advocate for greater awareness of the role that reflux plays in SIB. We have since noted a significant reduction in the number of individuals with SIB attending clinical consultations at family conferences and our research centre. A similar example is that of the identification of impaired satiety in Prader-Willi syndrome, which has changed the perception of over-eating dramatically and has had significant implications for diet management and obesity related health problems within the syndrome. 

The website will provide a structure which has the potential to continue to be developed and extended over time alongside research in this field. It will therefore have long term benefit to individuals with genetic syndromes, their families and the professionals working with them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95703</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cri du Chat Syndrome Support Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>FIND website syndrome group partnerships</gtr:description><gtr:id>BF05B7DD-5038-4CB8-96E8-6994A65D82E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FIND website</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458b9d9acb174.17336102-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners have been central to providing advice and feedback regarding the nature of the FIND website and this has enhanced the quality of the resource.

The overarching aim of this ESRC and Cerebra funded project was to enhance knowledge transfer to parents, carers and professionals of individuals with genetic syndromes. The project culminated in the development of a novel and sustainable website resource, designed to communicate research findings effectively and efficiently to user communities and the professionals who support them. 

The resultant website (www.findresources.co.uk) encompasses a range of different platforms, including video diaries and role-play examples, individual case studies and an interactive database, which provide essential information to families and professionals working with individuals with genetic syndromes. Through raising awareness of the individual genetic syndromes described on the website, and their associated needs, this resource provides the opportunity to enhance the quality of life and wellbeing of affected individuals and their families and to support and guide the professionals who work alongside them. 

The website has provided a fundamental building block for knowledge transfer that continues to be expanded and developed. Since the end of the project in 2014, we have received funding to add information regarding two further syndrome groups to the website (Lowe syndrome and Kleefstra syndrome). We have also been able to expand and refine the existing content of the site, improving accessibility and broadening the scope of impact.

Since the launch of the website in October 2014, we have continued to monitor carefully the impact of the website and evaluate its usefulness within the user community through three different strategies. Firstly, individuals visiting the site between October 2014 and February 2017 were invited to complete an online feedback survey, in which they were asked about the content, style and appearance of the website. Of the 172 individuals who have completed the survey, 82% 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' that the website had improved their understanding of the syndrome they were looking for information on. 98% of individuals found the information easy to understand and over 87% found the site easy to navigate. 87% said that they would revisit the website in the future and 83% said they would recommend the site to another person.

Parents qualitative feedback suggests the site is meeting the original needs that were outlined by parents and clinicians at the start of the project: 'I found the user platform of the site very easy to use. I came into the website read up and refreshed my memory, I always enjoy seeing information availability like this, as it was not always so for our family', 'I am a behaviour practitioner. The website is awesome, one of most user friendly ones I have come across. Easy to navigate and information is presented in manner that is easy to digest. Thankyou'.

A second approach was to conduct an evaluation of the concordance rate between parent reported priorities (in relation to their child with a genetic syndrome) and the top three pages viewed by individuals visiting the site. This approach provided some indication of whether the website is meeting the needs of those accessing this resource. Our analysis showed that concordance rates were good for some syndrome groups (for example Angelman syndrome), although this was not consistent across all groups (for example Cornelia de Lange syndrome). This has enabled us to identify areas for improvement, such as making priority pages more visible in the website, in order to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of each individual syndrome group. We have prepared this information for publication and it is currently under review at the Journal of Policy and Practice in Intellectual Disabilities. We have been asked to make minor amendments to the paper, which will then be accepted for publication.

A final strategy has been to evaluate the traffic on the website via Google analytics. Following the launch of the website in 2014 to date, Google analytics indicate that the website receives approximately 2000 visits per month. 80% of visits are from those who are new to the site, the remaining 20% are returning visitors. The top ten visiting countries to the website include: USA (47%), UK (30%), Australia (2%), Canada (1%), Brazil (1%), China (1%), Ireland (1%), Netherlands (1%) and Germany (1%), which highlights that the site has broad international reach.

Challenges overcome to achieve impact
Through our work at the Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders we have previously disseminated research findings through newsletters, articles, presentations at conferences and digital media such as CD-ROMS. However, these methods have had a limited scope because they only reached a small number of individuals (for example, research participants and conference delegates) and were not widely available or in a format that could be updated. In the current project, we have overcome these challenges by developing a resource that is widely accessible through computers, tablets and mobile phones. Information is stored in one place and is freely available 'on the move' to anyone and consequently has much greater accessibility. Furthermore, content can be updated quickly and effectively using a newly developed, bespoke CMS. Researchers and clinicians working within the Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders have received extensive training on the use of the management system which means that content can be updated by a team of clinically qualified professionals working within the field of intellectual disability research. This ultimately reduces the time taken for research to reach families and professionals. 

Maintenance and expansion of the website resource following the end of the ESRC and Cerebra funded project has required further resourcing. To date, we have secured five further grants which have included research assistant time to sustain the website since its launch in 2014. We are currently seeking a more stable stream of funding which will enable this to continue in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2D06AD98-A512-41B9-947B-3040A57E4877</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55ffe7e77dbc64.22190908</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Summary of outcomes:
This project has culminated in the development of a unique website resource for parents, carers and professionals caring for and working with individuals with rare genetic syndromes. We have developed a website with three core aspects: 1) syndrome specific information, 2) updates and news on current research studies, 3) a professionals section where assessments, measures and manuals can be provided. The website has been designed drawing on ideas and guidance from parents and professionals who were consulted throughout the project. 

This project has seen the first collaboration between eight syndrome support groups, the University of Birmingham and Cerebra. It has also brought together numerous professionals and parents. To date, these collaborations have contributed to the development of a video gallery of parent and professional accounts, a picture library with information about people with genetic syndromes and the adaptation and development of informational content covering a broad range of topics that are of importance to these syndromes. In addition, our newly developed interactive database allows families and professionals to ask questions about specific genetic syndromes and explore how individuals change with age. The infrastructure of this database is flexible so that dedicated website administrators can add new questions, groups and answers over time, providing a resource that has the capacity for continued growth and expansion.

Impact Study:
At the end of the project, an impact study was conducted. Findings were extremely positive and indicated that &amp;gt;80% of 172 individuals who provided feedback agreed that the website improved their knowledge of the genetic syndromes and found the information, mode of presentation (i.e. video/case studies) and appearance useful and pleasing. The majority of participants reported that they would visit the website again and would recommend the site to someone else. 

Website Traffic:
Since the launch of the website on October 30th 2014 up until February 28th 2017, there have been over 40,000 users to the site (82% of which are new visitors) and 49,000 sessions established. A session is defined as a period of time a visitor is actively engaged with the site. Analytics show that the average length of a session is three minutes, and within this time people, on average, visit four pages. Finally, analytics also show that 32 countries have accessed the website. The top countries include the USA, UK, Australia and Canada.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have identified a number opportunities for expanding the website and ensuring the widest possible impact. Firstly, we will continue to populate and expand the website; updating content as new research findings become available and broadening the focus to include other syndrome groups. In the last 12 months, we have launched content for Smith-Magenis and Kleefstra syndromes, and are in the final stages of development of content for Lowe syndrome. Secondly, to enhance the impact of the website, we are seeking the mark of approval from the Information Standard. We have already developed several protocols for monitoring content and feedback from users that place us in a strong position for obtaining this, and we will be moving forward to finalise these protocols and see this stage of the project through to completion. Finally, we will be encouraging the submission of content from external research teams who are active in the field of rare genetic disorders, including collaborators in the USA, to encourage further collaboration with the wider research community. These continued activities will require on-going financial support. To date, have been successful in obtaining five grants that have ring-fenced research assistant time to translate the findings of the research projects onto the website. Further funding opportunities which will provide more long term security for this unique resource.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74808075-05CD-422C-8E22-C361CC8BCCA2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54747ea6ed3198.96634143</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.findresources.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Cited in the Handbook of Intellectual Disability and Clinical Psychology Handbook</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>05C99C02-9DB7-4BF5-A91E-A1700548FD17</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c833bd6b71c3.68059020</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>54466165-4E27-452F-BA75-56D9A6E6A70E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The importance of understanding the behavioural phenotypes of genetic syndromes associated with intellectual disability</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Paediatrics and Child Health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fffa66565659f16e0d8c3786cec5deda"><gtr:id>fffa66565659f16e0d8c3786cec5deda</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waite J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5469c9a0c51f30.90878562</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K000659/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
