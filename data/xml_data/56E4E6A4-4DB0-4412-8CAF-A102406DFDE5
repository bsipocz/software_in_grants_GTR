Cinema and Modernity in Brazil, 1889-1930</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J008354/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed research builds on work I have been conducting in recent years that explores early cinema in Brazil. I will publish a book-length monograph to examine this theme in more depth. 
Since the 1980s film studies scholars have embarked on new studiesof the silent years of cinema, looking at the relationship between the emergence of film and the broader culture of modernity. These studies have highlighted how physical transformations - the growth of the city, aesthetics changes, which included new cultures of display in museums, , as well as intellectual changes - new representations of life by the vanguard, were addressed by and intersected with the development of the cinema. 'Foundational Films' explores the cinema's invention of modern life in Brazil, looking at how the medium's arrival and early dissemination was imbricated with the modernizing years of the First Republic (1889-1930). In doing so it explores how film was implicated in a broader project that set out to construct a modern Brazilian identity, while at the same time seeking to maintain the country's traditional social and political contours. 
The two key questions of this research concern: 1) How was the cinema part of broader processes of modernization taking place during the First Republic? 2) How does exploring cinema's arrival and development during this period contribute to debates concerning cultural modernity in Brazil, revealing its cinematic dimensions?
The project pursues these research questions through a book length monograph divided into four parts. Part 1 explores the relationship between early cinema and the city, focusing on the medium's imbrication in a project to transform Rio de Janeiro into a modern city. Part 2 examines ethnographic films made in the mid 1910s by Luiz Thomas Reis during an expedition to map the unknown regions and peoples of the Amazon basin. In doing so it traces relationships between film and anthropology, looking at how both projected notions of racial and cultural difference for a modern Brazil. Part 3 explores intersections ofsexual and racial politics in Brazilian intellectual and filmmaker's adoption of Hollywood's classical mode in the 1920s, linking it to their campaign to regulate the modern medium's mass reception and to broader concerns regarding governance; Part 4 uncovers a Brazilian cinematic modernism, analyzing vanguard movies made in the 1920s. Each of these parts illuminates the cinema's role in projecting a modern Brazil. 
This research is important for two reasons. First, the Brazilian case study offers new insights to early cinema scholarship and its link to the culture of modernity. To date, film scholars focusing on early cinema have not engaged with contexts beyond the Euro-American context, where assumptions about the film's inextricable link to industrial and technological advances must be rethought, and the medium's international dissemination must be considered. This project explores how Brazil's early cinema addressed impulses and models from abroad, recreating them according to the specific political and social context of the First Republic. 
Second, a cinematic engagement into the period of the First Republic provides much needed insights into the cinematic dimensions of modernity in Latin America, in general, and of Brazil, more specifically. Recent years have seen a proliferation of studies on Latin American film, which has raised key questions concerning modernity's spectacular qualities in the region. This work has largely tended to focus on more contemporary developments. By focusing on the lesser-known early years of Brazilian cinema, this project contributes to this growing area of research that has focused on the relationship between Latin American film and modernity, while taking it into a different historical direction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will support the development of Brazil-UK relations through academic networks and public events. Archival work at the Cinemateca Brasileira will strengthen UK relations with cultural institutions in Brazil, creating new links with an internationally renowned film institute.This will build on the applicant's past work on fostering relations with Brazil, in her role as liaison director for King's strategic partnership with the University of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo. 
The project will help to create an appetite for Brazilian cinema through public engagement activities, and so contributing to knowledge and quality of life.The series of film screenings will highlight how relatively simple dissemination activities, coupled with the right motivation, can lead towards making links with potential users and beneficiaries. The researcher has successfully organized public screenings of Brazilian films in her previous post at Columbia University (see CV) and in her current postion at King's, collaborating with media industries (Golant, 13 October, 2011), cultural organizations (The Latin American Film Festival 17 November, 2011) and government institutions (The Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and Brazilian Consulate). This project will build on this experience and strengthen cultural and institutional relationships between Brazil and the UK and also between King's and London's creative and media industries and related organizations.
The project will have beneficiaries beyond the academic environment through its engagement with the creative and cultural media industries. Archival work to be conducted over the entire 6 month period at the Cinemateca Braileira will facilitate the establishment of an important network with an internationally renowned film archive. This will be crucial to future activities, notably the screening of early Brazilian films in early 2013, planned as a follow on activity of the book project. These screenings will be organized in collaboration with the Cinematca Brasileira and its chief curator, Carlos Roberto Souza, and in conjunction with a London based film institution, such as the BFI. In addition to helping to forge networks between Brazilian and British film institutes, these screeningswill ensure that the project reaches a responsive audience outside of King's and beyond the academic environment. Potential films to be screened are: fiction films Grandfather's Glasses, (n. dir. 1913), Retribution (dir. Gentil Roiz, 1924), Lost Treasure (dir. Humberto Mauro, 1927), The Lawyer's Daughter (dir. Jose Soares, 1926);avant-garde films, Sao Paulo, Symphony of a Metropolis (dirs. AdalbertoKemeny and Rudolf Rex Lustig, 1929), Limite (dir. Mario Peixoto, 1930), and documentaries, Festivals and Rituals of the Bororo Indians (dir. Luiz Thomas Reis, 1917) and Picturesque Brazil. The Voyages of Cornelio Pires (dir. Corn&amp;eacute;lio Pires, 1925).The connection with the Cinemateca Brasileira will strengthen King's academic links to S&amp;atilde;o Paulo and Brazil. 
By feeding into creative and media cultural institutions in the UK the project will develop a richer historical understanding of international film practices and history. The screenings, to be curated in conjunction with the Cinemateca Brasileira will foster international relationships between Brazilian and British film institutes and archives.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47665</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J008354/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EFA3E9E-2186-4589-A542-814A214E3D57</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic, Portguese &amp; Latin</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
