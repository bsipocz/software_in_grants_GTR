But that process was controversial. Though we may now assume that tea is in no way contentious by comparison with other commodities such as oil, this was not so in the 1790s and early nineteenth century. In this period, one of heightened counter-revolutionary anxiety, tea held a range of negative associations for those seeking to mount defences against revolutionary discourse. In Ireland in this period, tea-drinking was associated with republican and nationalist sympathies and was actively discouraged by a range of improving writers, such as Mary Leadbeater, Abigail Roberts and 'Martin Doyle' (William Hickey).
 
Tea-drinking was principally associated with women and linked to a range of domestic and social disturbances. In the counter-revolutionary climate of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries - especially tense in Ireland in the wake of the 1798 Rebellion - drink and food were politicised in surprising ways. The drinking of tea possessed utopian and even republican connotations which disturbed improving campaigners of the period. This is evident in the various tracts and pamphlets written in Ireland in this period. I explore a range of materials in this project, such as the fiction of nineteenth-century Irish writers (Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson and the Banim Brothers), but the principal source is the fictional and instructional pamphlets, written by improvement campaigners (such as Leadbeater, Roberts, and Doyle [William Hickey]), which were distributed directly to the poor in Ireland in the early nineteenth century. 

These tracts explicitly advised the rural poor on agricultural and domestic modernisation: how best to plough fields, make butter and manage the household budget in brief and informative fictional dialogues. Almost all of the tracts warn against the drinking of tea and seek to promote a supposedly traditional diet of potatoes and oats. The sociable tea-drinking condemned in these tracts is significant for the extent to which it was viewed to be threatening and at one with other forms of 'bad sociability' which were deemed to be problematic in a context of counter revolution. Anxiety surrounding sociability in Ireland certainly intensified in the wake of the 1798 Rebellion, but sociability in Ireland had always been understood by reformers (and others) to be deeply political. However innocent it might appear to us now, tea-drinking in Ireland in the early nineteenth century was seen to enhance those political tendencies of the rural poor which worked against both Union and modernisation.
The key issue for this project is the relationship between consumption and processes of modernisation in nineteenth-century Ireland. The case of tea in Ireland demonstrates the ways in which Ireland was affected by modernisation at this point in time. The writers I examine were worried that Ireland was modernising too quickly. In part, this was because modernisation was a process over which these writers aspired, yet failed, to have control. Deabates surrounding tea and diet in Ireland shed an interesting light on modernisation in Ireland from 1789 through to the outbreak of Famine in 1845.

This project will result in a monograph, provisionally titled: Tea in Ireland: Consumption and Sociability, 1789-1845.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This topic will be of general interest to a wide audience as tea-drinking is by now, of course, deeply entrenched in Ireland and Britain, as it is elsewhere. Tea consumption in Ireland is currently one of the highest per capita in the western world and is deeply rooted in Irish culture. I have arranged, and will pursue, several projects to bring my research to wide public attention.

This topic is likely to be of interest to the general public in Ireland, in particular, and the large Irish emigrant communities in Britain. I will target these audiences through a public event for the Irish community of North-East England. As I live and work in the North East, I have arranged to present a paper on the history and politics of tea in Ireland at the Tyneside Irish Centre in Newcastle (see Pathways to Impact). The Centre serves the Irish emigrant community in the North East in a variety of ways through offering a range of cultural events (lectures on Irish history and literature as well as Irish-language classes) and concerts as well as outreach services. The administrator at the Centre, Fiona McClelland, is currently organising a date for my talk in October of 2012.

This topic is likely to be of interest to the general public in Ireland. As part of my project, I am writing a brief and accessible history of tea consumption in Ireland, which will explore the spread of tea-drinking from the late seventeenth century through to the Famine in the mid 1840s. This could be published in a popular historical magazine, such as History Ireland or BBC History (the former has a broad readership amongst the general public in Ireland as well as with professional historians; the latter enjoys a wide readership, including use by school-teachers, in the UK).
I will work closely with the successful Media Office at Durham University who will assist in publicising my project to the media (radio stations and newspapers) in Ireland and Britain. Programmes to be approached include the Pat Kenny Show on RTE 1 Radio in Ireland, which occasionally discusses academic research on topics of cultural and historical interest (including brief interviews with researchers) and the Food Programme on BBC Radio 4, which takes a serious interest in the history and culture of food and drink. I will also be contacting The Irish Times and other newspapers who have an interest in the cultural history of Ireland.

To assist me in these endeavours, I have arranged to take a staff development course at Durham University entitled Public Engagement in the Humanities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media Dissemination</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>417CA667-972F-4F65-AF9A-7C991F572193</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My research was widely disseminated to a huge audience through interviews and features in national and international newspapers such as the Guardian and Sunday Times (Irish edition) and Der Spiegel to prominent radio stations, such as BBC 4 (interview on the Today Programme), BBC World Service; Newstalk Radio (Ireland); local radio stations in Ireland; BBC Radio Ulster and NPR (USA). My research was also profiled by newspapers in India, Denmark and Kenya. I was recently interviewed about my research for Atlas Obscura, an American online magazine.

Impacts from this activity are ongoing. In the aftermath of this activity, I was contacted by numerous members of the public to discuss aspects of my research. I am participating in outreach activities that engage directly with members of the Irish immigrant community in the North East of England. A 'family research day' for the Irish community of Gateshead has been planned for March 2015 at which I will be presenting my research on tea and food in Ireland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542ea3171b2ba5.54377974</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I am in the process of completing a monograph based on my research on tea and food in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Ireland.
