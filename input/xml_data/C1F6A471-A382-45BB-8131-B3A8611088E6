As a nation we have become fascinated by such personal and family history and recognise its educational and memorial values. Yet testimonies from some of the crucial theatres of World War Two have yet to substantially emerge in our knowledge and deep understanding. The Sumatra Railway experience is one such gap. \n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai (dir. David Lean, 1957) famously tells the story of the construction of the Thailand-Burma Railway by the forced labour of Allied prisoners of war under the Japanese Occupation during World War Two. However, it is little known --because there has been little documentation and much less personal testimony -- that there was a second 'Death Railway,' on the Dutch East Indies - now Indonesian -- island of Sumatra. One reason why little material exists is because construction of the railway took place over a relatively short time, beginning only in May 1944, and ceasing in August 1945 with the end of the war. Around 7000 British, and Dutch soldiers and native labourers suffered terrible conditions, only around 65% of them living to tell the tale. But this is in comparison to the 61,000 prisoners of war who worked on the Thailand-Burma Railway - another reason why the latter overshadows the Sumatra Railway accounts. Although they remain unpublished with few exceptions, the stories of these men do exist - mostly in their own written words, but sometimes in the written and spoken words of their families, supported by the soldiers' war memorabilia. \n\nThe first aim of this project is to bring to light some of the most powerful and comprehensive of the personal testimonies from those who survived the experience and recorded their stories. These include three diaries of the researcher's grandfather, an English teacher and talented amateur artist; a body of little-used materials from the Far Eastern Prisoners-of War archives at the Imperial War Museum in London, consisting of unpublished diaries, memoirs and sound recording interviews with survivors; and interviews and documents including testimonies collected from the surviving FEPOW community and their families. The second aim of the project is to read and disseminate these materials in order to make the historical experience of the Sumatra Railway more widely known and to address gaps particularly about personal daily life in the historical records. The third aim is to examine the Sumatran FEPOW testimonies in the context of current cultural concerns about memory, family history and genealogy, and recovering testimonies of the trauma of war. The research will therefore consider the impact of such testimonies, or their belatedness or indeed sometimes even withholding, on future generations, particularly the families of FEPOWs; and it will ask to what extent psychological ideas of trauma and repression lie behind the 'silencing' of the Sumatra Railway experience.\n\nThe main applications and benefits of the project include: improving, using, disseminating and contributing to the IWM archive on FEPOWs; creating in collaboration with families of FEPOWs, and for this audience, a collective record of FEPOW testimony; breaking the historical silence around the Sumatra Railway; and increasing public awareness by producing a student-mounted exhibition at the IWM and online through the IWM website.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By the end of the project (2014), the main beneficiaries beyond the academic research community will be as follows:\n\n1. The IWM will benefit from: \na. increased use of its FEPOW archive relating to Sumatra to play a crucial role in an important new research project that will appeal across disciplinary fields. Dissemination of the research will lead to further use of its archives. \nb. the legacy of an expanded, better organised and completely catalogued archive; the student will donate new primary research sources already in her possession and that she collates during the course of her research.\n \n2. The FEPOW community will benefit from:\na. a research project that tells a collective story based on personal testimony about the Sumatra Railway and that addresses the form, history and challenges of personal testimony; it is expected that a small print run with a specialist press will make the research available for purchase by this readership on completion of the research.\nb. participation in the research in the form of interviews leading to consensual public dissemination of family histories, including documents held in their possession; emotional well-being that might come from that engagement, also arising from public attention to those materials that form an exhibition at the IWM. \nc. in the form of presentations at FEPOW events by the project student, raised awareness of the Sumatra Railway experience both within the FEPOW community and beyond.\n \n3. Members of the public, including school children who are a key audience already at the IWM, will be immersed in the Sumatra Railway experience via an exhibition at the IWM; the exhibition will focus on memories and testimonies and will include the documents (diaries, letters, audio-interviews, photographs, drawings, maps) that tell a collective story of the daily life of the FEPOWs. More broadly, the exhibition will stimulate the public to consider the social historical value of keeping such personal and family memorabilia. An internationally dispersed public will benefit educationally from a selection of these items, supplemented by the student's written explanations, for an online exhibition.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023163/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
