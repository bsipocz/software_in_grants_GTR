The visual arts reveal a recent proliferation of works that challenge such negative perceptions of 'difference'. Such work explores the complex cross-cultural identities that have resulted from immigration to Europe in ways that demonstrate the possibility of the co-existence of cultures, while avoiding the extremes of ghettoisation and one-way assimilation. This project aims primarily to trace the evolution of a still-emerging canon of 'postcolonial art' against the complex and shifting background of relations between European and non-European francophone regions and countries, including France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Maghreb, Western and Central Africa, former 'Indochina' and the Caribbean. It will highlight the heterogeneity of a corpus of photography, video, installation and performance art, much of which has received little or no critical attention. It will examine the ways in which such art provides counterpoints to monolithic, static notions of 'national' identity. This interdisciplinary project will develop a new field of French and francophone studies, while also developing new areas of research in a wide range of related fields, including postcolonial studies, art history, contemporary cultural history, gender studies, and studies in travel writing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond academia, the beneficiaries of my research project include artists, curators and members of the wider public. Artists and curators have been engaged since the primary stages of my research, through meetings and informal interviews. Such communication has been essential in enabling a full exploration of my research questions, while simultaneously proving helpful to certain artists themselves in the elaboration of their own projects. Moreover, dissemination of my research in the form of a book, articles, conference papers and talks, raises international awareness of artists' works among various academic communities. Presentation of their work in these forms - and inclusion of it as primary material on University courses - can strengthen artists' own applications for funding and exhibition of their work. Such applications can also be reinforced by the appointment of an academic advisor for their project (I have accepted an invitation to act as an advisor for an artist exploring Pied-Noir identity). \n\nDuring the period of the Fellowship, artists and curators will be engaged through the production of articles and conference papers, while this nine-month exploratory stage of my project will lead to multiple alternative forms activity designed to reach wider communities and maximise the potential impact of the research. These outputs will build on the links I have already established - and will develop further through research visits and conference attendance during the Fellowship - both with artists and with curators. \n\n(Please see 'Pathways to Impact' for further details.)</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79140</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My publications have been cited by artists, academics, curators and journalists in Europe, the US, North Africa and the Middle East, e.g. on the websites of artists Zoulikha Bouabdellah, Mounir Fatmi and Katia Kameli; in the exhibition brochure for 'Moroccan Mix' at the Victoria and Albert Museum; a political science journal based in Ottawa and Geneva (topopolitique.ca); and reading material for the Centre for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. My research tends to be used to explain, or reflect further on, art practices and the ways in which art - and cultural representation, more widely - reflects cross-cultural identities and relations. My article for French Cultural Studies was cited by gender activist and former Minister for Women's Affairs in Tunisia, Lilia Labidi (2014). My article for FCS was also a trigger for the Arts Cabinet's 'MENA: Norden' project, an international programme supporting exchange between artists, curators and researchers from a range of countries in Northern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East (http://artscabinet.co.uk/).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BCAB8674-BC5E-40F0-8F37-12C88B4DA0E6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5d716efd864.50383008</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>'Transcultural Encounters: Postcolonialism in the Visual Arts' introduced new objects of study and began to develop new approaches to transnational art. This award resulted in four main publications: three articles in leading journals in theory and critical thought, modern languages and French cultural studies, and one chapter, which develops ideas explored in the plenary paper I was invited to give at the University of Illinois, April 2011:

1. 'Alterity in Art: Towards a Theory and Practice of Infra-thin Critique', in Paragraph (Edinburgh UP, 2014, 37.3), pp. 356-71; first published online November 2014. DOI: 10.3366/para.2014.0134 

2. 'Cubist Counterpoint: Transnational Aesthetics in Video, Sculpture and Installation Art by Mounir Fatmi', in Forum for Modern Language Studies (Oxford UP, 2014, 50.1), pp. 40-56; first published online June 2013. DOI: 10.1093/fmls/cqt025

3. 'Art and the &amp;quot;Arab Spring&amp;quot;: Aesthetics of Revolution in Contemporary Tunisia', in French Cultural Studies (Sage, 24, February 2013), pp. 129-45. DOI: 10.1177/0957155812464166 

4. 'Transnational Francophonies in Contemporary Art: Franco-Maghrebi Crossings', in Adlai Murdoch and Zsuzsanna Fagyal (eds), Francophone Cultures and Geographies of Identity (Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2013), pp. 124-44.

The objectives of this award were met, while the corpus evolved to comprise primarily works exploring countries in North Africa. This was due to the emergence of artwork exploring the Tunisian Revolution of January 2011. Indeed, the Fellowship led to a new research project on art and the 'Arab Spring'. Art and the Tunisian Revolution was the subject of my article for French Cultural Studies, which shows how art avoids 'icons of revolutionary exoticism' (Gasteli) and negotiates an alternative between external and internal clich&amp;eacute;s and extremisms. My article for Paragraph uses a different corpus of works exploring the 'Arab Spring' in North Africa to advance a new approach to aesthetics of resistance, more widely, which is inspired by art theory and practice. My chapter for the international volume on Francophone Cultures and Geographies of Identity examines nuanced ways of evoking immigration and diaspora in different forms of installation art, with particular reference to work by Kader Attia. My article for FMLS examines visual representations of Islam that question clich&amp;eacute;s; I give particular attention to the work of Mounir Fatmi, which I discuss in relation to postcolonial theory and theories of globalisation. 

During the award, I was also commissioned to produce a CD inlet and online text for sound work, Mixologie, by Mounir Fatmi (Jan. 2013). Shortly after the period of the award, I also spoke at a public engagement event for the University of Bristol's InsideArts Festival: Representations of Islam and the Islamic World in France, Germany and Italy, with Prof. Schirin Amir-Moazzami, Freie Universit&amp;auml;t, Berlin and Prof. Charles Burdett, University of Bristol (The Watershed, November 2013). This event, including 3 talks and a discussion, was well attended and very well received by a diverse audience.

During the period of the award, I also gave a number of conference papers, as well as the following invited research papers and a presentation at the AHRC Translating Cultures workshop:

'Aesthetics of Revolution: Art in Contemporary Tunisia' (May 2013, University of Plymouth) 

'Representing the Unrepresentable: France and Islam in Performance Art, Graffiti and Digital Media' (April 2012, University of Sheffield)

'Translating Cultures, Media and Concepts' (June 2013, AHRC Translating Cultures Workshop, IGRS, London) 

My research on art and the 'Arab Spring', which began during the period of the Fellowship, led to further invited research papers and keynote addresses:
