Early reports indicate that houses, cattle sheds, irrigation channels, cultivated land, electricity supplies, and roads (including the Karakoram Highway, the only main access route through the Karakoram region) were damaged or destroyed by the floods. We aim to assess the cause(s), characteristics and consequences of these floods and establish whether they are likely to occur more frequently in the future in the Karakoram region. Climatic warming in recent decades has been associated with widespread retreat and disintegration of high-mountain glaciers. An important consequence is the increased storage of meltwater in transient lakes on glacier surfaces or impounded by moraine dams, which can burst with catastrophic consequences for society. Such large-scale lake development on stagnating and downwasting glaciers is widely reported in the central Himalaya (Nepal, Bhutan, China) but not in the Karakoram region where, historically, floods have occurred predominantly from ice-dammed lakes formed when tributary glaciers advance across the main valleys. The 2008 Chut Ghush floods are therefore unusual for the Karakoram region, but may reflect newly evolving glacial conditions that would favour the development of more hazardous lakes in the future. The occurrence of the floods provides a rare opportunity to characterise the processes and consequences of a (currently) unusual type of glacial hazard for the Karakoram. Building on research from the central Himalaya, we propose to identify the sources and mechanisms of the glacial floods from remote sensing and field investigations. In order to determine the controlling glaciological conditions under which the lakes formed, the key glacier characteristics will be mapped and glacier velocities calculated for the last decade from satellite images. To address the importance of the floods as agents of change that modify river channels and supply large amounts of sediment to river systems, their geomorphological impacts will assessed in the field by surveying flood landforms and characterising the flood sediments. Relationships between glacier dynamics and lake development will be explored and conceptual models of hazard formation developed that can be applied to environments with comparable glaciological and geomorphological characteristics. Outputs from the research will increase our understanding of current glacier responses to climatic warming and impacts upon society in the Karakoram, and will also be disseminated to stakeholders to assist with flood response and risk management efforts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to Swansea University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58FC081E-E744-4D96-B5F4-37B1E111794B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk entitled 'Glacier outburst floods in the Karakoram, Pakistan' given at the Department of Geography, Swansea University on 12 March 2009.

Following on from their field-based and remote sensing investigations of the physical landscape they then disseminated findings through the media and conferences and contributed to several subsequent disaster preparedness initiatives. 

On-the-ground in Pakistan, they worked with local and international organisations, feeding their results into regional risk-management strategies. Shaun Richardson, who led the research, took the findings to a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) workshop in Bhutan on emerging hazards in the Karakoram and Himalaya region. 

Richardson was also was part of a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Risk Reduction for the Himalayas Initiative organized by UNDP-ECHO to provide roadmap for hazard management across the region. He then prepared a chapter on Glacial Lake Outburst Floods for a larger report on 'Natural Disasters in South Asia - Rising to the Challenge', commissioned by the World Bank through its Disaster Risk Management and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) unit, based in India. He also prepared a report on 'Remote sensing approaches for early warning of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood hazards in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region', for the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, Bangkok.

Contributing to the formation of a new International Initiatives, in July 2010 Richardson was part of an 'International Expert Consultation' on glaciers of the Indus basins and their future for water, hosted and funded by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Kathmandu. The workshop has acted as a springboard for the subsequent Indus Basin Programme and Indus Basin Initiatives led by ICIMOD.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4D490129-84B2-48CA-AB10-B5ED1BAC23CE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546496242b14f0.28778164</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In summer 2008, four unexpected floods from the advancing Ghulkin Glacier damaged crops and killed livestock at Ghulkin village. The researchers investigated the cause of these floods and worked with local communities and NGOs to assess their impacts and likelihood of re-occurrence. 

The researchers tracked glacier surface features on satellite imagery finding that the glacier's flow had accelerated in recent years. From field surveys and eyewitness reports they reconstructed the flood route. The volume of both larger floods was calculated to be at around a million cubic metres - far more than could have come from glacier surface ponds. The researchers concluded that much of the water must have originated within or beneath the glacier and was likely released because of reorganisation of glacier conduits as the glacier flow suddenly increased. 

The model of flooding is not uncommon in Alpine settings, but differs from the more frequently publicised outbursts from glacier lakes that form on thinning, low-flowing glaciers (e.g. commonly reported from the Himalaya). Appropriate responses also differ for different types of glacial floods. Understanding the correct flood formation mechanism in this case has enabled appropriate local and regional risk-management strategies to be developed (see Impacts section).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Continued incorporation into local and regional flood risk management strategies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D5ECF9B6-EB33-4E98-9C23-9232741F5B84</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649a5e5087c4.76789459</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>43C489EA-2CCA-422E-8BA8-2539C2987787</gtr:id><gtr:title>Glacier outburst floods from Ghulkin Glacier, upper Hunza Valley, Pakistan</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geophysical Research Abstracts</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f100dec45660c9ce282491f67a672a48"><gtr:id>f100dec45660c9ce282491f67a672a48</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richardson, S.D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54647eddd9eb33.80723240</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CB5E3CBE-82E5-43B3-BF33-06DC0E5547CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Natural Disasters in South Asia - Rising to the Challenge: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f100dec45660c9ce282491f67a672a48"><gtr:id>f100dec45660c9ce282491f67a672a48</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richardson, S.D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54647b59efc2c9.00316242</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>382D5F5D-CD24-4F7F-AE45-3F210A172E35</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remote sensing approaches for early warning of GLOF hazards in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f100dec45660c9ce282491f67a672a48"><gtr:id>f100dec45660c9ce282491f67a672a48</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richardson, S.D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54647a1c04a730.41942745</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/G009023/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47491D28-C3A9-416A-8459-3ECC0715B776</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth Surface Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>07B1BD3F-A7ED-4640-8B09-C1F296DC56BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Glacial &amp; Cryospheric Systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
