One promising approach to achieving this aim is to improve the aerodynamic performance of ground and air vehicles using active flow control. In active flow control, measurements are taken from the flow in real time and, in response to those measurements, action is taken to positively modify the flow. For example, movable surfaces on an aircraft's wing or on the rear of a road vehicle may be dynamically adjusted to reduce aerodynamic drag and hence decrease fuel consumption. 

To implement an active control strategy typically requires an approximating flow model, which allows a beneficial control action to be computed from a given flow measurement. However, a significant challenge is that flows of practical interest have highly complicated and intricate dynamics, while computational and theoretical restrictions mean that the approximating models must be simple, or low-dimensional. One method of bridging this gap is to identify coherent structures in a flow, that is, spatial features which are of dynamical importance to its evolution and performance. If a small set of representative coherent structures can be identified, they can be used as the building blocks for a flow model and therefore facilitate a successful flow control strategy. 

The aim of this project is to develop the Optimal Mode Decomposition (OMD) algorithm, a method which systematically extracts dynamically important coherent structures from ensembles of experimental or numerical fluid flow data. The systematic nature of the data extraction is important since it provides a tractable method of analysing the increasing large-scale sets of fluid flow data that are now available. The proposed research will thoroughly benchmark the performance of the OMD algorithm across a range of fundamental and challenging fluid flows, assess the suitability of the extracted structures to be used for flow modelling and estimation and, finally, undertake a theoretical study to explain any observed behaviour. This research will therefore develop a methodology to underpin the application of flow control for improved energy efficiency and consequently addresses a current and fundamentally important environmental and economic issue.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The transportation sector generates roughly 20% of EU countries' CO2 emissions. Although emissions from other industrial sectors, such as energy generation, are expected to decrease over the coming decades, a predicted increase in demand means this is not the case for transportation. Consequently, it is of great importance to improve the fuel efficiency of, for example, road vehicles and aviation in order to address key climate change targets. Since aerodynamic performance is fundamental to the fuel and energy efficiency of road and air vehicles, understanding and controlling the behaviour of fluid flows presents an important, but technically challenging, pathway towards achieving this aim. 

This research seeks to address this challenge by developing a methodology - the Optimal Mode Decomposition algorithm - that will help researchers transition from the ability to accurately measure or observe a fluid flow, to being able to model, predict and improve its behaviour. Therefore, the impact of this research will be to produce a tool that enables the application of flow control technologies that can be used to improve fuel efficiency in transportation. This promises economic benefits through reduced fuel consumption and associated cost savings. More importantly, improvements in fuel efficiency will have environmental and societal benefits ranging from direct improvements to air quality to the vital medium-term impact of helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Outcomes of the proposed research will be presented at an industry-sponsored workshop towards to highlight the developed methodologies outside of the academic community, and also at the Imperial College Festival, a major public outreach event, in order to motivate flow modelling and control as a fascinating and practically important challenge to the next generation of researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96940</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>63000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Department of Aeronautics</gtr:department><gtr:description>PhD Studentship, Imperial College London</gtr:description><gtr:end>2021-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Imperial College London</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F1591129-A65E-4623-9F39-605106080476</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c39f948fc822.26273892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The fundamental purpose of this grant is to develop a computational method, the Optimal Mode Decomposition (OMD) algorithm, which facilitates the analysis of complex, high-dimensional data arising from fluid mechanics experiments and simulations. It extracts coherent structures which are the building blocks for low-dimensional models of fluid flows that can be used to design control strategies to improve flow efficiency. 

The main findings of the research project to date are:

Benchmarking (Work Package 1): The OMD algorithm has been shown to be able to extract known coherent structures from fluid flows with a range of dynamic complexity and has been shown to outperform (in terms of correctly identifying the underlying system's frequency and growth rate) the widely employed Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithm when non-linearity is present in the underlying dynamics (employing a standard Stuart-Landau model) and for the canonical flow of the cylinder wake. This evidence suggests that the OMD algorithm has the potential to generate more accurate flow models than possible using existing methodologies. 

Application to Noisy Data (Work Package 2): The situation was investigated in which the underlying data ensemble was corrupted by assuming either spatial or temporal down-sampling. This corresponds to analyzing flow data in which information may be unavailable at certain spatial locations in the flow or that the flow could not be sampled at as high a temporal rate as would have been desired. Both situations are experienced in experimental practice. The first key finding is that the OMD algorithm is effective when applied to spatially down-sampled data. Conversely, too aggressive temporal down-sampling (past the Nyquist criterion) was found to produce systematic errors in the extracted coherent structures and their associated dynamics. Subsequently, a key finding was the OMD algorithm could be modified to mitigate the effects of temporal down-sampling. This resulted in the development of a new algorithm, irregularly-sampled OMD (is-OMD), which has been demonstrated to perform well on both carefully controlled flows and highly-complex experimental flow data. Furthermore, new theoretical results were developed, proving that the is-OMD algorithm has rigorous convergence properties. 

Use of OMD modes in flow estimation (Work Package 3): Being able to infer the velocity field of a flow using only information on its boundary is of fundamental practical importance: if one knows what a flow is doing, this opens the door to improving its behaviour and measurements can only typically be taken on the boundary of a flow due to physical limitations on the placement of sensors. Turbulent flow past an axisymmetric bluff body was analysed using the OMD algorithm and it was found that certain coherent structures identified by OMD could be determined from pressure sensors on the base of the body using stochastic estimation. Improvements to the methods were found to be possible by pre-filtering the pressure data to only use sensors shown to be well-correlated with the coherent structures. This work is ongoing, but it is very promising that, for a dynamically intricate flow, estimation of the velocity field using structures obtained from the OMD algorithm is possible.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A new algorithm, is-OMD, has been developed which is an extension of the OMD algorithm allowing it to be applied to temporally downsampled data. This development of the code will be added as a freely-available option to the existing OMD algorithm allowing it to be used by others.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A2781421-EF05-4B27-8C50-751E73597C08</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd38d84edf67.30805253</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FA3B3750-CAFB-4948-9B53-3C3E78002105</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic reconstruction and data reconstruction for subsampled or irregularly sampled data</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Fluid Mechanics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f4ee69604ace85400d49a31d478e978b"><gtr:id>f4ee69604ace85400d49a31d478e978b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Krol J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1120</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a351abdbb2d99.39059713</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N015398/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ED6338AE-3457-45D6-90CA-B994C3CF422B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aerodynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
