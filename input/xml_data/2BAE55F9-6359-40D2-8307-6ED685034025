In this respect, it will push current thinking and research around cultural value beyond the generally predominant focus on a celebration of the various benefits that have been attributed to engagement with the arts and culture (and the value thus generated for both individuals and society) to encompass the more problematic and less savoury aspects of the cultural value problematic.

The project's intellectual starting point is the adoption of a social-critical approach to the study of the arts and culture predicated on a focus on the social production of the aesthetic and of the value attributed to it. Key to the understanding of processes of cultural valuation as socially produced is the corollary that the same goes for the nature of processes by which cultural value is denied. More interestingly, this project will explore the extent to which cultural value works in ambiguous ways, so that the same cultural artefact might, on the one hand, generate a variety of positive benefits for the economy, for certain groups or individuals and, on the other, create 'negative value' in the form of symbolic violence and stigmatisation of other social and/or ethnic groups. The project, therefore, aims to grapple with these profound tensions at the very heart of cultural value which of course have important implications both for the development of a rigorous cultural value research agenda and for the public policy discourses that are closely linked to processes of valuation.

This project therefore aims to be field-building, in opening cultural policy studies to the as of yet underexplored area of the ways in which cultural policies can be envisaged as part of a genuinely emancipatory political project. It builds on the work of social theorist Erik Olin Wright (2010) on the development of 'real utopias' that can map the way to a more just future, and aims at 'rebuilding a sense of possibility for emancipatory social change' by considering what a cultural policy perspective might offer to this endeavour. 

The question of how the authority to bestow or deny cultural value is socially stratified will be explored through a combination of theory building work and a case study, which will test the explanatory efficacy of the new theoretical framework, as well as its relevance to policy making and current professional arts practice. The case study at the heart of the project is Our BIG Real Gypsy Lives, a participatory arts project in Lincolnshire that has just concluded. Its aim was the recognition of the value of Gypsies' and Travellers' tangible and intangible heritage in the face of the systematic stigmatisation and cultural value denial this group has endured via highly popular and successful reality TV programmes such as My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. It was produced and delivered by Cultural Solutions, a Lincoln-based independent cultural consultancy, which are a partner in this project. This choice of case study allows for the research to focus on the case of Gypsies and Travellers living in England, who are a very interesting social group to look at in relation to both cultural value and social justice concerns. Qualitative empirical work will be carried out in the form of semi-structured in-depth interviews with the team and local charity that delivered the project, its funders and key Gypsy and Traveller participants.
The case study, and the focus on an ethnic group widely identified as 'cultural value-poor', will allow the project to explore what thinking on cultural value might contribute to the goal of a redistribution of cultural authority and the power to bestow value, alongside more traditional forms of emancipatory politics focusing on economic redistribution.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is inherently an outward looking project whose ultimate ambition is to contribute a theoretical framework and the outlines of models of practice that can support a quest for emancipatory social change. In this respect, then, 'impact' (as in emancipatory change of policy frameworks and professional practice) is at the very heart of this project's aspiration.

This project will be most relevant to three main groups outside of the academy, so that among them is where we expect impact to take place:

1. Participatory arts organisations and individual creative practitioners who specialise in work involving communities that face systematic 'misrecognition'; the bodies that fund them, and the local charities and community groups that work with them.
2. Local, national and international governmental as well as non-governmental organisations whose aim is to enhance social justice within the localities in which they work, who might be interested to find out more about how participatory arts and cultural products/projects might either hinder or facilitate their work.
3. Governments (at national, but especially local level) and other agencies, private and public, which fund, regulate, and support the activities of the two constituencies above.

These groups will be targeted via a three-pronged strategy: a) production of an open access project report aimed at a broad readership; b) targeted dissemination of project outputs and c) direct engagement with representatives of the three groups identified above.

a) A project report will be co-written by Dr Belfiore and the project partners specifically to raise awareness of the project and its findings among non-academics. It will be freely available to download from Cultural Solutions' web site and from dedicated project pages on the University of Warwick's website and on The #culturalvalue Initiative site (www.culturalvalueinitiative.org), Dr Belfiore's curated blog and research resource. The report will also be published in hard copy for the benefit of smaller arts organisations, community groups, charities, schools and individuals for whom online access might be problematic. In order to track the reach and impact of the report, in addition to download statistics from Google analytics, the Cultural Solutions partners have volunteered to informally monitor and track responses to the report among the practitioners and community organisations they have working relationships with for a period of six months after the completion of the project.

b) Dissemination plans will reflect the aim of the project to reach out beyond universities and will include an article in an arts professional publication (such as ArtsProfessional or Mailout), and a coherent social media strategy to communicate research findings as widely as possible to charities, NGOs, campaigning and community groups, artists and the general public. Dr Belfiore, Cultural Solutions and The #culturalvalue Initiative all have very active twitter feeds which will be harnessed for publicity purposes. The blog linked to www.culturalvalueinitiative.org will be a key dissemination tool via dedicated blogs by the project team, and invited contributions from artists, researchers and voluntary groups working in relating areas.

c) The end-of-project workshop will offer an opportunity for direct engagement with key non-academic players involved in carrying out and funding emancipatory participatory arts initiatives, and this is where, more realistically, the germs of real impact can be sown: implementation of research insights in actual policy and practice will be discussed with those who are best placed to carry it out, thus ensuring the project brings about at least the seeds of lasting changes in both thinking and practice. In order to record and track impact, Dr Belfiore will contact all workshop participants 2 months and 6 months after completion of the project to follow up on impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39304</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Plenary presentation at SERTUC conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A348F090-73D3-44F5-B5CA-B5ADD617BB92</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a plenary talk on cultural value, participation in the arts and social justice entitled 'Cultural participation and arts funding' at the conference 'The Future of Arts &amp;amp; Culture', organised by the Creative and Leisure Committee of the SERTUC, the Southern &amp;amp; Eastern Region of the Trade Union Congress, Congress House, London, 14th March 2015.

This conference's aim was launching the 'Show culture some love' campaign against widespread cuts to the arts and loss of jobs throughout the country.

However, the project included a workshop towards the end of the award that brought together the PI and sector partners, socially engaged artists, academics from a range of disciplines (arts and social sciences), arts policy makers, cultural managers, charity workers and postgraduate students, and participants reported that the discussion encompassing so many different perspectives was illuminating.

It is too early for findings to have been picked up by policy makers, but I have been successfully employed my findings in my teaching on an established PGT course on cultural policy and arts management with a vocational component that aims to train the future generation of arts and cultural sector professionals and leaders.
My work was also cited in the final AHRC report on the Cultural Value project to be launched in April 2016.

Another important way in which my research had impact, is through my involvement in the Warwick Commission on the Future of Cultural Value. I was the Faculty of Arts' Director of Studies for the Commission between May 2013 and February 2015, a large-scale public engagement project with a budget in excess of &amp;pound;350K and delivered in partnership with the RSA, the British Council, the Design Council and the Cheltenham Festival. The Commission's objective was to build on an area of research strength at Warwick with a view to promoting public debate and exerting both intellectual influence and policy impact. The report has received extensive coverage in the national media and internationally; was credited by Peter Hall as having formed the basis for the BBC Get Creative campaign launched in February 2015, and has had a pivotal effect in shaping debates around arts policy and funding ahead of the 2015 General Elections.

Most of the work of the Commission took place as I was conducting my research for this award, and therefore much of my own reading, fieldwork and emerging findings fed into discussions, events planning for the Commission, and above all were key in shaping the emphasis of the final Commission report on questions of social justice, inequality of access to cultural resources, and the need to move away from a deficit model of cultural participation, which were all key themes in my AHRC project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>11A02495-C42A-4805-87AE-2F2754A3E052</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463e175416062.54259796</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has begun the process of developing an original theoretical framework to consider matters of social justice in thinking on cultural policy research and practice.

The project has begun empirical testing for the theoretical framework though 11 semi-structured interviews.

The time-frame of the project was too limited to achieve the full development of an interdisciplinary and original theoretical framework, and for the full and detailed analysis of the interview transcripts. However, the project has successfully pointed out ways in which recent development in the social sciences (in particular political theory and sociology), media studies and cultural policy studies can be merged in order to develop fresh thinking on the impact that arts policies and funding can have on strategies for the tacking of misrecognition and social injustice.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings might be of particular use to community artists and organisations working with the Gypsy and Traveller community, and to policy makers and funders who support this kind of work. 

More generally, the research contributes to research and public and policy debates around cultural value and the rationales and criteria for arts funding, which is currently very lively.

I was able to develop and disseminate many of the insights via gained through the project via my involvement in the Warwick Commission on the Future of Cultural Value, for which I am one of two Director of Studies. This is a large scale public engagement and impact project, working with senior cultural leaders to bring insight from research into the process of developing fresh policy thinking (see http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/futureculture/).

I have been invited to talk about this project at a number of events nationally and internationally, including in Estonia, Australia, Singapore and due to the interest raised by the research I am now developing a follow up research project with a colleague at Warwick looking at the politics of media representation of the Gypsy and Traveller communities in British tv in a historical perspective. We are already in contact with key TV archives and have already identified a number of programmes to be investigated further.

The substantial project report will be available open access and it will be tailored to be scholarly rigorous whilst presented in such a way as to relate to live debates around participation and engagement in 'excluded' communities such as the Gypsy and Romany one is perceived to be</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>856D3372-E57B-4D6B-A0E9-7EE39EDCBC08</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463e4388d5d37.08996790</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/theatre_s/cp/research/researchthemes/culturalvalue/socialjustice/workshop/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BFE0219D-D5EB-4552-9EFB-400D3B0C7EFE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Humanities in the Twenty-First Century</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fb3ea42eccbab7c94c8339dfd8eaead7"><gtr:id>fb3ea42eccbab7c94c8339dfd8eaead7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Belfiore E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-230-36665-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5463dae22c5746.00681237</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7C7B60F6-B9E5-4EF9-8813-48B595AD2E53</gtr:id><gtr:title>Beyond Instrumental value: the challenge of &amp;quot;making the case&amp;quot; for the arts</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dd4be4ef64d27732fd26ca4b9f3ce8b3"><gtr:id>dd4be4ef64d27732fd26ca4b9f3ce8b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Belfiore, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e0c53f53de53.06981370</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5468FD0D-0C7C-4800-AE76-5003D4F90464</gtr:id><gtr:title>Who is cultural policy for?
