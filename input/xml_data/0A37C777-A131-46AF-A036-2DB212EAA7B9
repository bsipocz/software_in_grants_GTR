The immune/inflammatory system also controls repair, whether activated after microorganisms have been killing our cells, or induced because of physical damage such as cuts and wounds even if not accompanied by infection. 

The immune/inflammatory system is organised for defence, white cells circulate in your blood &amp;quot;on patrol&amp;quot; constantly on alert for invaders with base depots called lymph nodes, where they can be marshalled in large numbers and sent out for attack. Some white cells produce antibodies and some produce substances that kill microorganisms directly. The immune/inflammatory system is divided into 2 parts, innate and adaptive. The adaptive part learns to recognise the invading microorganisms, and makes special antibodies tailored to each disease-producing microorganism. For a more rapid response a front line defence is needed. This is the innate immune/inflammatory system. 

In so called inflammatory diseases, activators of these systems get produced without injury and infection and white cells are called into healthy tissue, and damage it. This occurs for example in heart disease and is the underlying mechanism inducing damage to joints in the disease called arthritis. To treat these diseases we need to find ways of shutting off the message to the activated cells. This project is the continuation of work we have been doing for many years on an inflammatory inducer called interleukin-1, which is particularly potent, and is known to contribute significantly to tissue damage. 
 
In our earlier studies we have identified a novel regulator of the defence system, which significantly enhances activities induced by interleukin-1. We have demonstrated that this regulator is present in various types of inflammatory cells including those that can potentially damage healthy tissue. In addition, we have shown that in order to increase interleukin-1 activities the novel regulator binds to a so called &amp;quot;signalling receptor&amp;quot;, which is located on the surface of the cell, and controls inflammatory activities through the cell.

In this project we are investigating how this new regulator interacts with the signalling receptor and how it changes its function. We are going to use this information to identify the events it triggers inside the cell, and which lead to changes in cell behaviour. This will improve our understanding of how signals by cytokines such as interleukin-1 are regulated, and how they increase activity in inflammatory cells. Such information will contribute to our knowledge of how these activities are controlled, how to moderate their effects, and ultimately how to develop specific treatments for inflammatory disease. 

Specific intervention is very important in controlling these events, as we need to have a certain level of functioning inflammatory responses in case of bacterial infection and/or we are in need of tissue repair. By moderating the novel regulator, we have the possibility of leaving the main system intact and functioning normally. We have recently obtained detailed information about which parts of the regulator are particularly potent. In this project we will use this information to investigate the consequences of activating and blocking this regulator and determine what cellular functions will be disturbed through the different parts of the protein. This will make it possible to ultimately design specific treatments for diseases characterised by abnormalities in these functions. 

State-of-the-art computational modelling will provide much clearer insights into the many processes involved in this very complex system, and predictions from the models will give us information, which we will use in future experimentation and drug development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Host defence responses are induced through the Toll-like and IL-1 receptors and activated by ligand binding and system-specific co-receptors. This project uses systems biology to analyse the function of the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI), and its control by its co-receptor TILRR.
TILRR is a ubiquitously expressed spliced variant of FREM1, of the FRAS1 family, which is independently transcribed and translated. We have demonstrated that TILRR controls IL-1RI function and activation of NF-kB, and regulates inflammatory and anti-apoptotic responses by IL-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified mutants, which selectively control inflammation and survival signals through IL-1RI. 
Here we will use these mutants to identify events at the level of the receptor complex, which selectively direct downstream activities. The data will be included in a computational model of receptor function, and predictions from this will inform design of experiments on signal transduction and gene regulation. We will use robotic screening to identify key intermediates involved, and characterise a subset of these in functional assays. The data will be incorporated in our NF-kB model, which we have demonstrated faithfully represents the biological system. Key regulators, predicted by the model, will be included in microarray experiments to identify relevant changes in gene activation profiles, and data analyzed using work-flow and included in the model. We will use FLAME, use super computers, to make possible expansion of the model to a level where we can link receptor function with signal transduction and gene activity. Predictions will be tested in relevant wet experiments and results will inform the model, in multiple iterations, to yield a comprehensive in silico representation of the biological system. 
The results will provide a platform for future comprehensive investigations of cellular response and expand the use of agent based modelling and the FLAME framework.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Medicine and Biology
Background
We are investigating mechanisms driving cellular responses in the healthy organism. However, identification of events, which selectively perturb aspects of receptor function and response control, will improve our understanding of inflammatory dys-regulation, characterising disease as well as basic biological evens. 
 This field of work is fundamental to multi-factorial inflammatory conditions, widespread heath problems in the aging population of the developed world. Dys-regulation of inflammatory responses is a determining factor in prevalent and costly diseases including atherosclerosis, which costs the UK government &amp;pound;30.6 billion/year (NHS publication care quality commission, Sept 2009) and arthritis and related diseases which cost nearly &amp;pound;6 billion /year (Arthritis care sheet, 2007). It is also a major factor in organ failures and a highly significant parameter in the prognosis of cancer. 
 Host defence mechanisms are tightly controlled systems, activated through Toll-like and IL-1 receptors. Ligand binding and co-receptor recruitment determine the appropriate signal amplification and activation of downstream events. The potential for therapeutic targeting at the level of the receptor has been demonstrated by the major advances resulting from development of the anti-TNFs. Diseases such as arthritis and atherosclerosis contribute significantly to degradation of quality of life in the older population. The population as a whole and organisations such as the NHS will continue to benefit from advances in this area. 
Benefits
1. Expanding the range of treatments for inflammatory diseases offers significant promise in reducing the period of morbidity in the last years of life. Greater specificity as is expected to result from targeting the functional sites in TILRR, will bring a number of benefits, such as potentially reducing side effects etc. In addition, selective blocking of anti-apoptotic responses is expected to increase the eicacy of chemotherapy while maintaining normal defence mechanisms against infection. 
2. The innate immune defence is also critical to pathogen resistance in plants and animals, therefore, results from these studies may also have the potential to contribute to agricultural biotech - for example by GM strategies that derive disease resistant crops, without the need for agents, potentially hazardous to the environment. An example might be flax or rape engineered to express elevated levels of the TIR family Rust Resistance Protein. 

Computer Science
Background
Successful detailed models of this system will be of great interest to researchers in systems biology because they will demonstrate the power of this approach, which can be used in any other types of system. The FLAME framework ensures that the model can be integrated with other related systems and is being used in labs worldwide. 
Benefits
The models will be made public so that others can adapt and integrate them with their own systems. Companies such as Genesys, and epiGenesys, started by M. Holcombe, and others which develop software for a wide range applications, will benefit from expansion of the systems. 
 
Biotechnology and systems biology, as applied to human health and innovation have been identified by the DTI as a growth R&amp;amp;D area in the UK because of the potential market for treatments. Given the stated aim of both the EU and organisations such as Yorkshire Forward to develop a Biotechnology Cluster in South Yorkshire, and the aims of the Treasury to foster Bioscience R&amp;amp;D in the UK as a whole, the potential commercial use for our work fits well strategically.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>553185</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MRC Technology (MRCT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>NF-kB inhibition</gtr:description><gtr:id>386B8308-5DE2-44C0-B61C-B889A298275C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Production of monoclonal antibodies, targeting receptor induced amplification of NF-kB.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546e0f485fc5d2.46635755-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>technical expertise, monoclonal antibody production</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Identification of novel regulatory component and knowledge of function</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Computational modelling</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FD933EA-46DC-423E-A07C-A58193A57E15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a interdisciplinary collaboration which so far has involved co-supervision of one PhD student and has produced 4 publications and one manuscript submitted.

Experiments on receptor function, have demonstrated the role of TILRR in adapter protein recruitment and signal co-ordination. The analysis has identified novel mechanisms controlling TIR receptor crosstalk, which will be examined in further detail using techniques optimized by our collaborators in Cambridge. 
 We have used siRNA technology and TILRR knockout cells to determine the impact of TILRR expression on receptor function, inflammatory signalling and gene activation profiles. Results from both sets of experiments show effects IL-1 receptor expression, NF-?B regulation and gene activation profiles, central to control of inflammatory responses, and host defence mechanisms, and include alterations known to be significant in disease development. 
Proteomics was used to determine post-translational modifications affected by TILRR expression. The analysis identified a wide range of phosphorylation events correlating with changes in receptor complex composition and related to regulatory events known to be affected by changes in signal amplification. 
 TILRR SNPs, recently identified by the 1000 Genomes Project, were selected based on predicted effects on TILRR/IL-1RI association and receptor conformation, using 3-D modelling, and impacts on signal amplification and gene activity tested in in vitro experiments.
 An ongoing collaborative study focuses on investigating the mechanisms controlling the interaction of the TILRR glycosaminoglycan chain with the extracellular matrix, and the impact of this interaction on signalling receptor function. 
 We have successively expanded our agent based computational model to reproduce TILRR control including novel mechanisms and signalling intermediates, as well as structural components. As data from the in vitro experiments are confirmed, results are incorporated in the model, which is verified, and predictions tested in biological assays. We have demonstrated that the model accurately reproduces the biological system, and allows us to explore signal sensitive regulation of NF-?B and to consider the impact of crosstalk on IL-1-induced responses. In addition, the computational model has been used to identify a novel mechanism for structural control of the NF-?B pathway and to define a role for this process in pathway calibration. We have recent data using I?Ba mutants, which will be included in the agent-based model to further expand the comprehensive in silico representation of the NF-?B network and enable in depth analysis of mechanisms controlling signal amplification.

Delineating TILRR control of the IL-1RI system, using systems biology. BB/J009687/1.

Regulation of receptor function: 
Experiments on receptor function have demonstrated the role of TILRR in regulatory cross talk. We have identified novel interactions at the level of the receptor complex, which are expected to contribute to signalling amplification and crosstalk. Specific tools are being developed to enable further analysis of these events, which will be carried out in collaboration with Prof N. Gay at the University of Cambridge. The project is expected to be completed spring 2016.

We have employed 3-dimensional modelling to identify residues predicted to be located in the region of TILRR/IL-1RI binding. These data together with in vitro assays, was used to screen a series of TILRR SNPs recently identified by the 1000 Genomes Project. The selected SNPs include residue 448, which we identified earlier as a functional site using alanine scanning. Further, the screen includes both enhancers and inhibitors of TILRR amplification, as well as polymorphisms that selectively control the canonical and non-canonical NF-?B pathway, with similar effect as some functional mutants identified by our alanine scanning exercise. Effects have been confirmed at the level of gene activity as well as in relation to upstream regulators I?Ba and Akt phosphorylation, respectively. 

A series of experiments have used TILRR knockout cells to determine the impact receptor expression. These have demonstrated pronounced effects on IL-1 receptor expression levels, consistent with our published data showing reduced ligand binding in the presence of TILRR siRNA (Zhang et al., 2010). The data are currently being included in our agent-based model, to inform on long-term effects of TILRR expression on system control.

Signalling and signalling crosstalk:
We have assessed the involvement of signalling cross talk between IL-1 induced responses and regulators of cell attachment and structure. The experiments included 3-dimensional predictive modelling of I?Ba interaction with the cytoskeletal components actin and Spectrin, in vitro experimentation and agent based modelling of NF-?B regulation. The study identifies role for cytoskeletal sequestration and release of ??Ba during NF-?B activation, and predicts this to provide a rapid mechanism for calibration of signal activation in relation to input levels. Further, they show that the process is controlled by TILRR, and predicts the cytoskeletal involvement in NF-?B regulation to specifically impact inflammatory responses while anti-apoptotic signals are unaffected. 

Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of conserved residues we have identified I?Ba regulatory sites, which control the cytoskeletal interaction and have created mutants with altered binding to the cytoskeletal component. A next set of studies is using the mutants together with the wt I?Ba to characterise the mechanisms controlling I?Ba/Spectrin interaction and further elucidate the impact of changes in this interaction on pathway control.

Work on the impact of binding of the cell surface glycosaminoglycan/fibronectin interaction, have demonstrated significantly higher rupture forces for proteoglycans than measured for integrin /fibronectin binding, consistent with a distinct regulation of the two types of interactions. Further experiments have shown that fibronectin binding of the glycosaminoglycan at linked to GAG attachment site at residue 112, has pronounced effects on IL-1-induced signalling. 

Gene regulation profiles:
We have demonstrated that alterations in TILRR expression have pronounced impacts on gene regulation profiles. The experiments have used TILRR siRNA transfection and in vitro assays. In addition, the analysis has taken advantage of TILRR knockout cells, and compared gene activation with profiles obtained using wild type cells, at the resting state and during an inflammatory response. Results show pronounced reductions in induction of inflammatory receptors and signalling intermediates, many of which are known to be key regulators in disease. 

Identification of novel intermediates:
Our robotic screening of cDNA libraries has identified intermediates, which are activated by IL-1 only in the presence of TILRR. These include known regulators of the network as well as intermediates, which were not previously known to be induced by IL-1 and/or to control NF-?B activity. Dominant negative constructs of known intermediates of the pathway have been used in in vitro assays to determine the mechanism of activation and to identify relevant steps in pathway control. The project is expected to be completed spring 2016.

Computational modelling:
The agent based NF-?B model has been successively expanded through incorporation of in vitro and in vivo data and has been used to inform experimental design throughout the tenure of the grant. It now includes receptor systems, signalling intermediates, structural components and genes relevant to both the canonical and non-canonical NF-?B pathway. Using the model in interdisciplinary studies has had a marked impact on analysis of activation at the level of the receptor complex, signal transduction, specifically in relation to signalling crosstalk and gene activity in relation to signal amplification. Predictions at all levels have been tested in biological assays. 

In parallel with the interdisciplinary studies, we have determined limitations of the model in regards to simplifications and levels of complexity, in order to improve usability and increase speed. In addition, parts of the in silico work have been designed to compare the agent-based analysis with other modelling/analytical programmes, and to consider combining computational modelling with statistical approaches.
