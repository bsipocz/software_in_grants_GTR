This unexpected behaviour manifests itself in the appearance of singular shapes, such as corners, in the evolution of the vortex. The proposed research aims to advance our mathematical understanding of the processes leading to formation of such singularities in some well-known models for the evolution of vortex filaments, and in certain intimately related nonlinear Schr\&amp;quot;odinger equations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research would have an impact on a number of different areas of fundamental science and would have clear beneficiaries in the short, medium and long terms.

The proposer, the research assistant, the School of Mathematics and the University of Birmingham constitute the short-term beneficiaries of the proposal presented here. The funding of this programme of research would provide the proposer with the resources and focus needed to consolidate her position as an independent researcher at the interface of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, after two recent periods of maternity leave.

It is anticipated that the postdoctoral researcher would benefit from a period of intensive training and collaboration with the proposer, and would be exposed to an international community of scientists in related disciplines. This experience would provide the postdoctoral researcher with the support required to go on to develop his/her own independent career in this fertile field.

The expected increase in the number of academic visitors to the School of Mathematics in connection with the proposed programme promises to contribute to the interchange of ideas and the formation of new collaborations.

In the medium term, due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the proposed research, this project aims to have a broad impact on researchers working in theoretical fluid mechanics, dispersive PDE and harmonic analysis. Thus the potential academic beneficiaries belong to all three of these areas. In addition, it is expected that the analytical techniques develop to study the singularity formation phenomena addressed here will be of significant independent interest within the analysis community in the UK and internationally.

In the longer term, the proposed research aims to contribute to developing the shape of the UK research landscape at the important interface of rigorous mathematical analysis and applied mathematics. It is anticipated that the success of this application-driven theoretical research programme would lead to further investment and help facilitate the emergence of more widespread expertise at this broad interface. In particular this would lead to an expansion in doctoral training capacity and ultimately sustainable research strength in a more comprehensive portfolio of application-driven mathematical analysis.

As is historically the case, ambitious research focussed on furthering theoretical understanding of physical processes, such as that contained in this proposal, often culminates in major economic and societal impact in the long term. Although such claims are of course tentative, these considerable benefits rely on sustained investment in fundamental research of this nature.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A central purpose of this proposal has been the transfer of techniques and perspectives from dispersive PDE and modern harmonic analysis to the study of qualitative properties of solutions to some well-known physical models in the setting of fluid dynamics and ferromagnetism.

In particular, certain special classes of solutions, which exhibit natural symmetries, have been used to describe the evolution of vortex filaments in classical fluids, and the magnetisation spin in ferromagnets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results in the main outputs of this award lead to some challenging open problems. In particular, the question of whether the studied self-similar solutions are stable structures has been taken forward by the team and answered in the affirmative in a recent preprint. 

The methodology used in the main outputs of this award is based on techniques from modern Harmonic Analysis to provide a precise description of the behaviour of self-similar solutions. This methodology has the potential to be applicable to the study of particular solutions of other nonlinear equations describing physically relevant phenomena which exhibit certain oscillatory behaviours.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BC4FA6BB-234F-40CC-B65C-9F6238DFE880</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546390379e6378.44190879</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B858EA06-06DD-4901-9571-202591A4DDFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-similar solutions of the one-dimensional Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nonlinearity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e3b333961dad42b953e2a3cca00630fa"><gtr:id>e3b333961dad42b953e2a3cca00630fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guti?rrez S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f9539536e4b66f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9210AC1D-DBF2-46BF-A435-11F99E0054E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Strichartz Estimates for the Kinetic Transport Equation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communications in Partial Differential Equations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3a9a774015dde5e06ffeb965d2ed04aa"><gtr:id>3a9a774015dde5e06ffeb965d2ed04aa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bennett J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542d6032162b04.48445298</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J01155X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
