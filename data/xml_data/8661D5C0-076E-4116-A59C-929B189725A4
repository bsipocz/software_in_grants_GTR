The project was advertised on the Library's Medieval Manuscripts blog, and readers were invited to nominate manuscripts from the exhibition to be digitised, http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2012/05/the-chosen-royals.html. This objective was met and exceeded with 71 manuscripts now available on the website. In addition to full digital coverage, each record includes a comprehensive description of each manuscript, its text and illumination, provenance, and bibliography. 

The Digitised Manuscripts website is extremely popular: in 2012 there were 696,284 total page views from 102,286 unique browsers. In 2013 this had nearly doubled to 1,127,419 total page views from 210,174 unique browsers. In January 2016 alone, there were 212,000 page views from 43,000 unique browsers, so the impact is continuing. The two Royal projects have been publicised on the Library's Medieval Manuscripts blog with 142 posts. The blog also has a wide readership, with 300,000 in 2012 and 626,000 in 2013. In January 2016 alone there were 49,000 views from 28,000 browsers, so this medium aimed at a general audience continues to be effective.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FDCACF20-E02A-44B8-9BD8-59D8B8573C86</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464c5a8a66f67.58151938</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award was a follow-on project under the Digital Equipment and Database Enhancement for Impact scheme, to enhance the research undertaken for the AHRC-funded Royal: Illuminated Manuscripts of the Kings and Queens of England project, and its dissemination. As a digital enhancement project, the principal goal was to augment the resources on Royal manuscripts available to researchers on the British Library's Digitised Manuscripts website, http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts. The goal of the project was to provide freely-accessible full online digital coverage of 24,750 pages from approximately 40-50 manuscripts featured in the Royal Manuscripts: The Genius of Illuminated exhibition held at the British Library 11 November 2011-13 March 2012.

The project had two other objectives. The first was to convene two workshops to allow students and scholars to build on the existing research undertaken as part of the Royal project by analysing texts and images of these manuscripts in collaboration with other researchers. One workshop was held at Durham University on 6 June 2012, hosted by Professor Richard Gameson, Department of History, http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2012/06/royal-workshop-judged-a-royal-success.html. At the workshop eleven undergraduate students presented papers on manuscripts included in the Royal exhibition, and Roger Middleton, Lecturer Emeritus, Department of French Literature at the University of Nottingham, presented a live display of the new research capabilities of the Digitised Manuscripts website. The second workshop was designed for post-graduate students, and was held in London on 9 November 2012. This workshop explored the research possibilities of digitisation in a seminar examining three original manuscripts together with their magnified digital images, http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2012/10/digitising-royal-new-perspectives-on-the-royal-manuscript-collection-a-workshop-at-the-british-libra.html. 



The third output was the publication of a collection of ten essays on the development of Royal libraries, enhancing and building on the research completed for the initial Royal project. This book, 1000 Years of Royal Books and Manuscripts, edited by Kathleen Doyle and Scot McKendrick, was published by British Library Publications in 2013. Two of the essays (by Richard Gameson and Catherine Reynolds) were drawn from the new research presented at the Frank Davis lecture series held at the Courtauld Institute of Art in autumn 2011. Four (by Michael Wood, Nicholas Vincent, John Goldfinch, and Jane Roberts) grew out of lectures given as part of the British Library lecture series accompanying the exhibition. One (by James Carley) is on a royal manuscript that was once a part of the Old Royal Library but was not included in the exhibition, and so his research is presented in the volume for the first time. The remaining three contributions (by Joanna Fronska, Scot McKendrick, and Kathleen Doyle) build on research that was undertaken for the initial Royal Manuscripts project presented in the exhibition catalogue. Thanks to the grant provided by the AHRC, the book is extensive illustrated with ninety-four colour illustrations, https://shop.bl.uk/mall/productpage.cfm/BritishLibrary/_ISBN_9780712357081/87293/1000-Years-of-Royal-Books-and-Manuscripts-(hardback).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The huge popularity of the British Library's Digitised Manuscripts website, http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/, and its Medieval Manuscripts blog http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/, with around 1,125,000 and 625,000 page annual page views, respectively, means that the research disseminated electronically has a wide non-academic audience who are able to use the freely-available images and information creatively and innovatively. The new publication, 1000 Years of Royal Books and Manuscripts, was written for a general as well as a scholarly audience, with essays ranging chronologically from Anglo-Saxon kings to the current Royal Library.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E541A99E-89B4-4BE1-BDC2-5C6F4528AA30</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-169043690.12363598777f84d0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1D90D249-B15A-4618-A597-9DA1A3CAC0B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>1000 Years of Royal Books and Manuscripts</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/58c81fddffd8f6421789383092e07f6f"><gtr:id>58c81fddffd8f6421789383092e07f6f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Doyle, K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780712357081</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_706950879791d5e8e2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C4958304-C96B-4E4F-9F11-3A5BA35C8D5F</gtr:id><gtr:title>1000 Years of Royal Books and Manuscripts</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ce720ea541f8aed635e7babd80ed2e0f"><gtr:id>ce720ea541f8aed635e7babd80ed2e0f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Doyle, Kathleen; McKendrick, Scot</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780712357081</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-5362183875.7416093bb5a4ce</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K502820/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>287497FB-DD4A-44CC-AC13-DBAFADC9AD82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
