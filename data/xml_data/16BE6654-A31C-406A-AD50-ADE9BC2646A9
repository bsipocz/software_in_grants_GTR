The biosensor will be able to detect water pollution emanating from different sources such as pit latrines. 

The project will focus on monitoring urban areas, as latrine coverage and the related groundwater pollution affects, proportionally, more people than in rural areas. It is estimated that 70% of urban settlements in Tanzania are unplanned. The problems of urban unplanned areas include lack of centralised sewerage and the inaccessibility of emptying services for onsite technologies. This leads to increased groundwater pollution in areas where shallow wells are used. 

According to the World Health Organization, 70% of diseases in Tanzania are water pollution related costing close to US$ 600 million annually. As such, we estimate that proper monitoring of water pollution can trigger increased and appropriate sanitation and water treatment which could lead to Tanzania meeting their Millennium Development Goals. 

It is expected that the use of a bio-sensing system will also help collect data on the current state of groundwater as well as increase the awareness of the local population in groundwater contamination.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will help determine the current state of groundwater pollution in Tanzania, Africa as well as to develop a biosensor that will be able to increase the awareness of groundwater pollution and therefore drinking water quality in the region. Results will be communicated to the local population via the tools developed and will aid in the assessment of local sanitation and drinking practices. The project also has the ability to empower the communities to monitor their own groundwater. This initial work will establish collaboration between Newcastle University and ARDHI University as well as produce a set of scientific papers for worldwide dissemination of results.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>134859</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>St Woolos Hospital</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with ST&amp;Uuml;WA Company</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDC6DCB6-B849-4E97-9239-D8E4DF11BE44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Clear understanding of how a well is constructed and the screening set up used at the bottom of the well.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6fc29643543.98482518-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>We collaborated with Ing.

In our workshops, approximately thirty water technology experts (including people from government, society and academia) met for a full day in order to exchange knowledge on the monitoring and management of water and the use of our microbial fuel cell sensor device. During the workshop there were opportunities for presentations by participants and project research groups, we also included site visits and a test of the biosensor. The feedback was positive by participants, participant comment highlights, when asked about how was the workshop:

Thanks to this early project dissemination, our project showed great interests by students. We have been able to recruit students to work on this project as part of their final MEng investigation and thesis. Students participating in the project have stated the outcome of their involvement. For example, Richard (MEng student) has recently sent an e-mail to all collaborators stating:

&amp;quot;Just wanted to thank you for your time and help, you made my stay [in Tanzania] very enjoyable and productive. I have taken a lot away from the experience and hopefully the data I have gathered and the field sensor we set-up will help further the project and bring future success.

This new technological solution is currently being field tested in a household to demonstrate how it can increase the quality of life through awareness so results on this field will be provided in the future. This technology has also attracted and informed small businesses in Tanzania and the UK (Palintest and Northumbrian Water). 
Technology development through consultation: The project has engaged the Tanzania society from the beginning, especially the low-income community located in our research area. Two workshops were conducted which allow early consultation with African communities in the development of the proposed biosensing technology. With this we have been able to adapt the technology to provide a user friendly solution. Our workshops have been attended by the general public and feedback on the technology has been provided showing the effective transfer of knowledge, and an increase in public awareness. 
Technology transfer and increased collaboration: Our collaboration with Ardhi University has been challenging, however we have been able to conduct the work as time progresses, obtaining initial positive results: assembly of experiments in laboratory and on field. The work is still on progress and it is expected to generate more data in the next months. There have been visits of UK researchers and students to Tanzania, and vice versa. This has broaden the knowledge of participants as to how business is conducted in each area and has allowed for technology transfer. 
The project is currently in its early stages as it has just concluded after a year of intense research so it is expected that impact will increase as time progresses. In the next report we will report in the following areas: 
Communication of results to local population: Results will be communicated to local population via the tools developed (e.g. biosensor). This will also aid in the assessment of local sanitation and drinking practices. The results depicted by the field data will allow locating further areas of improvement and deployment of the technology. The final examination obtained on the groundwater quality will be made available to local population through the display of poster in schools or community service areas. This will inform poor communities on the state of their groundwater quality and the relationship between the use of pit-latrines and the groundwater quality.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8FB76B15-7B26-472F-A276-2E6604BA9900</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c2b29d9936.43233991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>- Evaluation on the application of biosensors in developing countries through community consultation.
