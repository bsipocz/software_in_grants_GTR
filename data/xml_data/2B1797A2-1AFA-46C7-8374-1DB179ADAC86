This project will examine the relationship between apologies, abuses and dealing with the past. Using the island of Ireland as a case-study, the project will explore a range of wider themes concerning the ways in which apologies have been constructed, delivered and received beyond the state. It will focus on apologies for harms inflicted by paramilitaries, churches and the corporate sector. In addition, international and comparative research will be conducted by a PhD student (funded by QUB) to explore the resonance of these themes in other contexts. 

At a conceptual level, the notion of apology is diversely theorised and almost always focused on the state. Despite widespread acceptance that apologies are key to dealing with past wrongs, in practice the theoretical literature is rarely informed by detailed empirical assessment of the views of apologisers, victims or the general public. 

States, armed groups, churches and large corporations have in recent decades apologised for past wrongs, albeit with mixed results. For victims, apologies often appear to be an important element of dealing with the past. However, in practice the precise interplay between apology and notions such as accountability, reconciliation, truth and legitimacy is little understood. More generally, while 'saying sorry' is almost a given as an acknowledgement of hurt, there have been few efforts to develop a nuanced grasp of what constitutes a legitimate apology and how the drafting, performance and reception of such apologies may or may not assist in coming to terms with past wrongs. Through exploring the perspectives of perpetrators, victims and community, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the role of apologies in dealing with the past. 

AIM

Using Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as a case-study, this project will explore the role of apologies in dealing with past harms linked to paramilitary violence, institutional child abuse and the economic crisis. A QUB-funded PhD student will explore the resonance of these themes in select international contexts.

OBJECTIVES

1. To explore a range of themes concerning the construction, delivery and reception of apologies in dealing with the past including: apologies and law; apologies and accountability; apologies, acknowledgement and truth; apologies timing, choreography and performance; apologies, legitimacy and audience; apologies and leadership; apologies, reconciliation and follow through; apologies and imagined communities.

2. To deploy a research methodology involving an extensive analysis of academic and policy literature and archival research; semi-structured interviews with 'perpetrators', victims and key policy makers and opinion formers; focus groups with victims; and a CAPI survey (and focus groups) with members of the general public.

3. To disseminate the findings and academic and policy outputs through a project website, twitter, blogs, stakeholder seminars, a major international conference and presentations at a range of international and national conferences. Publications will include one monograph, at least four articles/book chapters, six policy documents and 12 blogs. 

POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS 

The project is designed to develop a deeper understanding of the role of apologies in dealing with the past. Previous research on apologies has often been confined to disciplinary silos. Premised on the understanding that apologies are usually shaped by legal implications, this project will seek to develop a bridge-head between law and other fields including politics, philosophy, anthropology, history, sociology and psychology. While drawn from the experience of Ireland, a more holistic understanding of the role of apologies will be of interest to academics, policy makers and activists in any society struggling to come to terms with the harms of the past.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Since the research will focus on apologies linked to a range of different types of past wrongs (paramilitary violence; institutional child abuse; and the economic crisis) this project will have multiple beneficiaries. The nature of the impact for each will be different. In the short term, beneficiaries can broadly be divided into 'apologisers' (those who have historically constructed and delivered apologies or who are currently doing so); primary, secondary and tertiary 'victims' (direct victims, their families, as well as the wider public) in Ireland, North and South. In the medium to longer-term, via presentations at international conferences and dissemination of policy and academic outputs, the findings will resonate at national (both jurisdictions) and international levels. They will inform political leaders, policy makers, victims and victims' groups, and a range of international stakeholders who are grappling with related challenges.

The timing for work on apologies in Ireland could not be more apposite. Both the British and Irish governments are slated to introduce dealing with the past legislation in autumn 2015 and thereafter to make statements of acknowledgement regarding their respective roles in the conflict. Similar actions will be expected from paramilitaries and others. There are ongoing public inquiries North and South into child abuse by religious authorities (due to report in 2017 and 2018 respectively). A Parliamentary Inquiry into the banking crisis in Ireland is in progress and has already provoked a debate about the efficacy of apologies from politicians, policy makers and corporate officials. 

As is detailed in the CVs and Pathways to Impact, McEvoy, Bryson, McAlinden and MacCarthaigh have strong pre-existing relationships with victim organisations across the sectors. We will consult with such groups on their needs regarding apologies before finalising the 6 policy outputs and 12 blogs. Anticipated themes could include: user-friendly advice on the legal consequences of apologies; the management of expectations; and whether, when and how to engage with 'perpetrator' organisations. The project will also hold a series of seminars at the beginning, mid-point and end of the project (rotating between the two jurisdictions). Working through and with representative bodies, we anticipate an immediate impact for victims, both nationally and internationally.

With regard to apologising organisations, again the team has strong links. Potential impact relates to enhancing the knowledge, skills and capacity necessary to deliver a genuine or 'meaningful' apology. For example, as discussed in the Case for Support, one specific planned output is a universal template on how to construct a 'legitimate' apology encompassing drafting, engaging with victims, timing, delivery, choreography, legal ramifications, etc. Impact will be achieved through the policy outputs, blogs, project website, twitter and final conference.

More broadly, asking fundamental questions (such as whether 'saying sorry' is ever enough), raises 'big' societal issues about apologies and how they relate to healing, remorse, memorialisation and reconciliation. Public engagement on these and other issues will be facilitated by the survey and focus groups with the general public, the project website, planned blogs (12) and the project twitter account. The website will include short video clips relaying the key findings and relevance of the research as well as anonymised excerpts from interviews and focus groups (pending permission). QUB press office will help promote the project throughout. 

The research findings have the potential to inform national and international policy-making. Political leaders, policy makers, academics, local NGOs and research participants will be invited to the project conference. The policy papers, blogs and academic outputs will be widely disseminated.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>545838</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>First Stakeholder Seminar - Nov 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>153BB49E-8228-4E68-A9C1-BA8BDC12B9C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the first in a series of stakeholder seminars associated with our project. Using Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as a case-study, the event explored the relationship between apologies, abuses and dealing with past harms across three separate and discrete sites of analysis (paramilitary violence, institutional child abuse and the economic crisis). In contrast to existing theoretical and state-centric research on apologies, this seminar focused on the views of apologisers, victims and the general public. 
We began with an overview of our approach to this work and then explored in groups a range of text-based and audio-visual apologies. Anonymous feedback was facilitated by hand-held audience response devices. The first draft of our universal template for the construction of a 'legitimate' apology was then circulated and discussed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5880e18fc7a445.97171032</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N010825/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2ABF7A73-38A2-4394-B71D-0AAF27E24D79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminal Law &amp; Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>71F7A6EE-7B50-498A-B077-02B819CA6027</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Governance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
