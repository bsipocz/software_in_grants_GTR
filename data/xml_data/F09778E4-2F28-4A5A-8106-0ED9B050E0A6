The project will engage with scholars from 10 groups of arts and humanities disciplines and from over 20 settings, to ensure that the methods for capturing and articulating value are conceptualized in their own terms, rather than imposing simplifying dichotomies. In addition, the study will explore the experiences, understandings and practices of a further 15 value actors, including public cultural institutions, third sector organizations, cultural engagement initiatives, and other partners, users and beneficiaries of arts and humanities research.

The study will draw on social scientific approaches to make a distinctive contribution to enhancing methodological capability to capture cultural value in its richness and diversity. The development and testing of a robust configurative approach (i.e., an approach that explores and maps a field in its depth and richness) to recognising and capturing research value in the arts and humanities will be a core contribution of the study. The in-depth case studies to be carried out will combine attention to institutional and individual experiences, with careful mapping and weighting of the networks within which value is enacted and recognized. 

The conceptual model and innovative methods for capturing the value of research that will be refined and tested in the project were originally developed in Oancea (2011), drawing on Oancea and Furlong (2005, 2007a, 2008) and Oancea (2007b). This body of work has critiqued excessively instrumental interpretations of the value of research, but sought to move beyond dualist arguments about, for example, intrinsic vs. instrumental value, value vs. impact, articulating vs. measuring value, or social accountability vs. economic accounting. On this basis, the project proposes a textured notion of cultural value. The conceptual model identifies aspects of cultural value and suggests that the availability of evidence and the straightforwardness of the measures we use are in inverse proportion to the breadth and complexity of value realisation. 

The methodology of the study is driven by concerns for texture, diversity, nuance and ecology. The configurative approach to capturing cultural value will complement the focus on breadth and precision (i.e. aggregative approaches) that has been common in recent efforts to measure cultural value from socio-economic perspectives. A multiple case-study design will ensure both breadth (through 35 case studies of research units, research initiatives, value-oriented programmes, partner and user or beneficiary organisations) and depth (through 70-100 interviews and network mapping methods &amp;quot;drilling down&amp;quot; into each case).

The project will pursue primary impacts on individual and organizational understanding and practices, and secondary impacts on public discourses about the cultural value of arts and humanities research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is expected to have primary impacts on individual and organizational understanding and practices, and secondary impacts on public discourses about the cultural value of arts and humanities research. 

First, an important area of primary impacts will be on the numerous higher-education (HE) and non-HE settings included in research. Prior work on research impact by the applicant, using similar methodologies, has shown the potential of these approaches to catalyze interest in the value of research and influence individual and organizational practices within the settings researched, with ripple effects in their immediate professional, disciplinary and institutional communities. 

Second, the project will engage with arts and humanities scholars from a wide range of disciplines and settings, to ensure that methods for capturing and articulating value are conceptualized in their own terms, rather than being based on simplifying dichotomies. Participants in the project will be invited, for example, to engage in face-to-face (via 4-5 meetings) and written dialogue with the research team, leading to a publishable, co-owned output. By these means, the project will contribute (as a secondary impact) to the carving out of a discursive space, within which wider and more nuanced articulations of cultural value are made possible.

And third, the project will aim to inform the refinement of impact assessment practices by funding bodies, as well as the development of institutional impact strategies (primary impacts), in higher education and beyond, to ensure that they recognize the distinctive value of arts and humanities research and the diversity of ways in which it can be articulated (secondary impacts). Project briefings will be targeted at relevant constituencies and communicated via impact blogs, Twitter and other social media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38291</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Feedback from some of the 25 participant settings has pointed to the potential of this work to catalyze interest in the value of research and influence individual and organizational practices.

In addition, the findings have been used in researcher training.

The project also aimed to inform the refinement of impact assessment practices by funding bodies. Examples of engagement include participation in an invited HEFCE roundtable on novel valuation methods (spring 2015), a keynote to the European Foundation for Management Development (June 2015); contribution to the Cultural Value's project workshop on novel methodologies for capturing value configurations (July 2014); and an invited contribution to the Independent Metrics Review (2015).

Cultural value is a contested concept, beset by philosophical, practical and political tensions. the study argues that interpretations of value - cultural or otherwise - are part of complex ecologies of cultural life, creation and understanding, while at the same time underpinning economies of description, prescription, inscription and ascription. Meaning, expression, narrative and practice, combined and recombined in experience, are core themes in our participants' description of the arts and the humanities. However, more needs to be done across all levels of the research governance system so that meaningful engagement is sustained and narratives in cultural terms are not perceived as a risk in accountability contexts.

In addition, the study developed an innovative methodological approach for articulating and communicating the impact and cultural value of research: qualitative network analysis using collaborative configuration tracing and visualisation. The approach uses co-constructed, case-centred network diagrams to enable the structured elicitation and visualization of information from participants (researchers, administrators, facilitators, partners, users and beneficiaries) and the assessment of the relative strength of different flows and relationships relevant to creating, articulating and demonstrating value. Unlike quantitative network studies, the emphasis here is on the process of construction and interpretation of qualitative network maps by the participants. Subject to further testing and refinement, the approach and tools that we have developed are amenable to use in research, evaluation, communication and developmental work in higher education institution and funding organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Following publication of one peer-reviewed article, two blogs and magazine items, and several conference inputs in 2015, and forthcoming publication of another peer reviewed article in 2016, the substantive and conceptual findings will benefit scholars and research managers in the arts and humanities, particularly in their work on refined understandings of research value and on reporting the impact of research for research assessment purposes. Particularly important is the project's methodological contribution to the creation of robust configurative approaches to impact case study development, which can contribute to advances in the fields of research impact and evaluation, but also to practical developments in the creative sector, heritage, museums, and cultural policy. The findings have been used in research training and there is potential for further use in professional development. The methodological tools generated can lead to digital developments and we have started exploring this possibility.

Other communication about the project to date includes an extended report to the Cultural Value project, a blog entry, posters, talks and presentations, invited talks, publicly-available Prezi, and Twitter.
