In September 2013 we held a Dialogue and Dissemination Event at Durham University, to which we invited key figures from relevant healthcare policy and practice and from healthcare chaplaincy work, as well as some participants in the study itself; delegates at this event were informed about our first findings and had the opportunity to be involved in their interpretation and discuss their implications. In October 2013 the PI of the project was invited by the Hospital/Healthcare Chaplaincies Council to give the 10th Norman Autton Memorial lecture, entitled Faithful Judgements: Moral Pioneers Between Faith and Biomedicine. This was a prestigious event with wide exposure to those professionally involved in chaplaincy work and faith aspects of healthcare. [http://www.nhs-chaplaincy-spiritualcare.org.uk/Lectures/NormanAutton10thlectureJackieLeachScully2013.pdf].

We successfully bid for external support from our two universities' joint ESRC Impact Acceleration Award funding. This provided us with funding to prepare a draft research briefing targeted to policy makers and to chaplains, including draft recommendations, in collaboration with the Church of England's National Advisor on Medical Ethics and Health and Social Care policy. The work on this was delayed for 12 months due to a period of serious ill-health of the PI. The draft version was launched at a one-day policy and practice roundtable which was held in London in September 2016. The invited participants at the roundtable were given a presentation of our research findings and then worked with individual project team members to identify possible policy and practice responses. Their input was also valuable in fine-tuning and revising the draft recommendations. Our key findings (that the majority of our interview respondents encountered difficulty in finding out their faith group's ethical position on new reproductive and genetic technologies, felt they had not received appropriate guidance from their faith group leaders, and had been unable to raise their faith concerns in the clinical setting) prompted some thoughtful responses and ideas for changing practice, especially among healthcare practitioners.

The involvement of two clinicians on our Advisory Board and our ongoing links with healthcare professionals and with chaplains continue to present opportunities to engage with a variety of groups to think more broadly about issues of faith in the context of new and emerging reproductive and genetic technologies. In collaboration with a leading clinician from a regional fertility centre, we designed and used a patient questionnaire in which visitors to the clinic are asked whether faith issues are a concern for them and if so, if there were any aspects of practice they would like to see modified. 

We have also been liaising with other bodies active in fertility and genetic medicine, including the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, to explore avenues through which our findings can inform practitioners' and patients' thinking, and have been invited by the HFEA to give input to one of its regular meetings of professional bodies. The HFEA has informed us that following the policy and practitioner roundtable in September 2016, which they attended, they are in the process of preparing some guidance notes to be placed on their website pages for healthcare practitioners and for patients.

We have presented the work to healthcare researchers and practitioners, and to a meeting of social workers and counsellors who use discourse analysis, in order to generate debate about faith in the context of rapidly technologizing medical practice. As a consequence of one presentation by CI Professor Robert Song at the annual conference of the College of Healthcare Chaplains in September 2016, we were asked to meet with two representatives from the Catholic Bishops' Health and Social Care Advisory Group, to discuss contributing to their project on Religious Literacy in the NHS. Discussions are ongoing about taking this further.

In terms of more general public impact, during and after the funding period we publicized the project and its findings in a variety of arenas. These included BioNews, the online newsletter of the Progress Educational Trust; Spice FM, a Tyneside community radio broadcast for black and minority ethnic communities; the online Muslim News; and People and Science, the newsletter of the British Science Association [http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/people-science-magazine/december-2013/people-faith-encountering-biomedicine]. An interview in the Church Times generated interest among faith group leaders and chaplains, ie those working with some of the people most directly affected by the interaction of faith and access to NRGTs. The project was the subject of an invited contribution to the Westminster Faith Debates blog [http://faithdebates.org.uk/blog/jackie-leach-scully-people-of-faith-encountering-biomedicine-bioethics/]. A further example of general public impact was an invitation to speak about the project at the Roundhay Science Festival in Leeds in March 2014, and an invitation to the PI to appear on BBC Radio Ulster's 'Sunday Sequence' programme in April 2016.

One surprising finding of the project was the lack of prayer or worship resources that specifically address the situation of patients faced with making ethically and spiritually troubling decisions about the use of NRGTs. We have worked with one residential liturgy-writing group (Hymns for Healing) using creative practice to write a set of responses for use in Church of England services. We aim to pursue this in further work with local and national groups through creative writing and art that explores these profound experiences.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>24F8BF88-416E-4518-BEF4-5273D3EB5B60</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54ca52a5c9d7e9.40066494</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This study aimed to explore the processes through which people who identify themselves as 'religious' make ethical evaluations of new reproductive and genetic technologies, focussing on Christian and Muslim faith groups. Among the key findings were:
 -- that many participants, from Christian and Muslim faith groups, noted that information on the official teaching of the religion on new reproductive and genetic technologies was hard to find. 
-- some faith groups have not yet crafted an official teaching on NRGTs. 
-- the most readily available forms of religious guidance were sometimes not viewed as authoritative, if faith leaders were felt to lack knowledge and/or the faith group's theological responses were regarded as inadequate. 
-- most interviewees felt that the healthcare system was generally unaware of faith issues and the onus was on patients to raise these issues. However, they also recognized the difficulty for healthcare professionals of raising sensitive issues.
-- many interviewees felt that they had had no opportunity to think through their treatment choices from a faith perspective, and that this had caused them concern or distress.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information could be used to shape relevant healthcare policy, practice and training, by clinicians and others. It will also prove useful to faith group leaders in terms of their engagement with their members facing these issues, as well as potentially informing faith group policy on NRGTs.
