Older generations of computer software allowed the user to search for key themes, access background information and examine commentaries, but these new platforms combine these resources with opportunities to access the text through mobile devices, share verses with acquaintances through social media and add personal responses. 

The commercial success of these platforms raises questions for scholars of religion, new media and the digital humanities regarding the potential of digital technologies to transform the relationships between readers, texts and institutions. The CyberBibles project will seek to address three research problems. First, how do creators use design and marketing discourse to shape users' engagement with their products? Second, what patterns of use and networks of attention are emerging among users? Third, how do these products affect the relationship between readers and sacred texts?

Three of the most sophisticated and high-profile examples have been selected for this study. The first, YouVersion, offers multiple Bible translations in twenty-four languages and allows users to keep journals, add commentary and share responses. YouVersion's smartphone app has been remarkably successful, recording thirty million downloads over its first three years. The second case study, BibleMesh, offers subscribers access to a vast library of video, text and animated Bible presentations created by a worldwide network of prominent Evangelical pastors and theologians, augmented by opportunities for online small-group Bible study. The third case study, GloBible, restructures the Bible through innovative text navigation tools and illustrates it with an extensive library of images, videos, virtual tours and historical information. Each of these products is designed to encourage more regular and informed use of the Bible, particularly for proselytism, but each guides interpretation and use in quite different ways. 

The 9-month project will be conducted in three stages. The first will examine the work of designers and advertisers; the second will focus on the platforms themselves; and the third will analyse the activity of users. A mix of methods will be required, drawing on qualitative and digital techniques. Designers and users will be interviewed, texts and videos will be analysed, and digital tools will be used to map the international networks of communication between users. 

Findings of the &amp;quot;CyberBibles&amp;quot; project will be published in at least three peer-reviewed journal articles and delivered to four conferences and research events in the UK and Scandinavia. Publications will be addressed to audiences in the study of new media, religion and the digital humanities. Findings will also be communicated to public audiences outside the academy, through presentations to a range of Christian festivals and conventions. A one-day academic conference will be organised at the end of the project to examine the digitisation of sacred texts in a wider range of religious traditions, encouraging future collaborations in comparative research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The &amp;quot;CyberBibles&amp;quot; project examines three prominent examples of digital texts. Each example uses search functions, images, video, social media and mobile apps to attempt to transform the relationship between reader and sacred text and to encourage readers to share their insights and favourite passages. Better understanding of these products will impact a range of public audiences, including but not limited to Christians and Christian institutions. 

Dr Hutchings has already developed excellent connections with British Christian media circles through his doctoral and post-doctoral research, and has delivered presentations of his work to numerous public conferences, conventions, study days and festivals. These connections will continue through this fellowship, including ongoing use of social media to discuss findings and presentations to events. Christians in the UK show great interest in understanding contemporary media culture, including the impact new media are having on religion, and this research will help both individuals and institutions as they seek to evaluate and make use of technology. 

This fellowship ends with a conference that will include scholars of a wide range of new and world religions. This event will work toward future research collaborations and projects that will extend the impact of this project to a much broader range of faith traditions. 

One of the most important consequences of new media for religion has been a destabilizing of traditional community boundaries, offering media users the opportunity to form smaller like-minded enclaves, to proselytise more invasively or, potentially, to communicate with respect and interest across former divisions. The digital texts studied in this project are being used to create new national and international networks of communication, an issue of clear relevance to scholars and policy-makers interested in community cohesion. The Mediating Religion Network could become an excellent platform to share research with these audiences, and opportunities to develop the network will be explored throughout the project. 

Digital text is of interest far beyond religious circles. Museums and libraries are making texts and images available online to encourage viewers to engage with national and global history and culture in new ways, while artists and authors are experimenting with new forms of digital art or literature. The digital Bible is by far the most successful of these projects, in terms of popularity, but has so far not attracted significant academic attention. This research project will enable cultural institutions to learn more about how a vibrant communication culture can emerge around digital text platforms, offering models that could be emulated in future. Findings will be communicated with these audiences through Dr Hutchings' publications and presentations to scholars in the field of Digital Humanities, an area heavily engaged with the study and design of digitisation projects. By encouraging new approaches in this academic field, Dr Hutchings can realistically hope to communicate his research to the institutions currently engaged in digitisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56056</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation (Christian New Media Conference)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B75EAD6-21EF-48BB-9119-9C5C756FBC94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk introduced a large audience of Christian media practitioners to the findings of my research, sparked questions and discussion, and led to conversations that have been useful for my own research

For Christian practitioners and organisations, this issue is of intense interest, because it addresses the future place of the Bible in Christian culture. This issue is also of economic and strategic interest to religious publishers, who must find ways to survive and capitalise on this disruption to their industry. My research findings have therefore been received with interest, and I have reached a wide audience of practitioners through a range of engagement activities. I have organised a one-day conference in London, attended by 30 academic and non-academic specialists in digital reading, including publishers, programmers, practitioners and scholars representing a range of different religious traditions. I have been invited to deliver talks and workshops to gatherings of Christian practitioners and leaders, including the Christian New Media Conference and MediaLit. I have also written a monthly post for the BigBible blog run by the CODEC research centre, Durham University, to engage Christian practitioners in discussion of my findings. The importance of this research for the publishing sector is demonstrated by my invitation to deliver four lectures explaining digital society and digital publishing to a global meeting of CEOs and senior staff members of the United Bible Societies in Frankfurt, as Guest Speaker for a 3-day digital publishing seminar.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F53C7508-6169-40BF-A895-796922DC8825</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463338b801914.92022389</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant analysed three  (YouVersion, GloBible and Uncover), each of which uses digital technologies to encourage different kinds of engagement with biblical texts. YouVersion is a popular mobile app, downloaded 150 million times worldwide, offering access to different translations and a range of reading plans; GloBible is a desktop software package offering multimedia educational resources; and Uncover is a paper book, printed with QR codes linking to online video. Project research fellow Tim Hutchings studied these three examples using a range of methodologies, including interviews, a survey, focus groups, participant observation and thematic analysis of online materials. Analysis of these three case studies led to the following discoveries and developments: 

1) Through interviews with designers and organisation leaders, this project was able to map the theological understandings that motivated design and marketing decisions for each product, contributing to literature on the social shaping of technology and persuasive technologies.
2) Dr Hutchings designed, distributed and analysed a survey of product users, developing valuable new quantitative research skills. This survey gathered the first academic collection of empirical data on digital Bible reading practices. 
3) Using this survey, a series of follow-up interviews and a survey of online materials, this project was able to identify some of the major perceptions among users as to the effect of digital reading on their relationship with their sacred text. These perceptions will merit further empirical study.
4) Dr Hutchings also used his time as an Early Career Fellow to develop and maintain the Mediating Religion Network, co-founded by project supervisor Professor Marie Gillespie. Dr Hutchings encouraged an increase in membership, maintained the Network's website and email list, and organised two Network research events, including a one-day conference on Digital Media and Sacred Text. The Network will continue in the future, serving as a valuable information hub for UK and international researchers working in the field of religion and media.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The study of religious e-reading is in its infancy, but beginning to flourish. I have already been invited to present my findings to research seminars at six universities in the UK, Sweden and the US, addressing departments of religion, digital humanities, sociology and English. My research raises important questions about the economic impact of digital publishing and the role of age and gender as factors affecting reading practices, all questions that academics should explore in future work. I also hope that academics will be able to access the vast banks of user data stored by publishers; such a project would require an interdisciplinary team with expertise in Big Data analysis, but would offer unprecedented insight into global reading trends. 
 
The study of biblical e-reading is of particular interest to Christian practitioners, because it addresses the future of use and understanding of the Bible, a matter of continuing anxiety (see, for example, the many reports commissioned by Christian organisations concerned about levels of ). My research findings have been welcomed with interest by a range of Christian groups, and I have been invited to share highlights of my work at public conferences, clergy training events and industry seminars. Among religious practitioners, my findings could encourage more critical analysis of digital media and more creative engagement with digital design, on the part of representatives of a wider range of religious traditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4CCB8984-2D97-4EDA-BB63-7AC57302C8CA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546350fc903175.53205409</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://bigbible.org.uk/author/tim-hutchings/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultancy for the United Bible Societies</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36AF16F8-B6BA-41F8-B7E8-F2DEA2A5B8DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The United Bible Societies is a major international group of publishers.
