beyond</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L000423/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This series of seven one-day seminars focuses on the impacts of the economic recession and austerity measures on work-life balance (WLB) and associated policies. Both may be adversely affected if economic pressures overshadow social and individual concerns.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aims of the series are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to understand the WLB challenges for employees, employers and policy-makers posed by economic recession and austerity measures&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to provide a forum for employers, unions, policy makers and academics to discuss how to meet these challenges. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;Discussions will focus on a triple agenda of enhancing employee WLB, sustaining or enhancing organisational effectiveness, and contributing to social justice. Seminars will examine the implications of the economic environment for gender equality, health and well-being, care and care giving, employment relations and workplace innovations, and explore the impacts on individuals, families, organisations and wider society. International contributors will highlight experiences in other national contexts, especially those in which there have been similar severe cuts to the UK, as well as innovative workplace and policy initiatives.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminars will contribute to current policy debates on WLB, and on the quality of working life, happiness, social justice, equalities and care arrangements.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Policy makers (e.g. Government departments) and policy shapers (advisors, charities and think-tanks) need the latest evidence about how current and planned WLB-related government policies (e.g. changes to employment law and maternity leave), together with changes in working practices triggered by the recession, will affect the triple agenda (see objectives). Policy shapers need information on the wider impacts of the changing policy landscape and regulatory framework on employees' work and personal lives, including the provision of informal care, as this has implications for benefit systems and services. Equality organisations (e.g. the EHRC and the Centre for Social Justice) require specific information on the impact of the recession on vulnerable workers to help them support these groups, including any required improvements to public service provision. The seminar series will meet these needs by disseminating and fostering discussion of the latest research on organisational and social impacts of the recession on WLB. Discussion of the latest research on policy initiatives and their outcomes elsewhere in Europe will enable benchmarking, indicate areas of consensus and disagreement about policy impacts and implications, and contribute to recommendations for future evidence-based policies.

Employers across sectors and in SMEs, HRM practitioners and the CIPD have expressed concerns about sustaining employee engagement and also public sector services with increased job insecurity and demands on 'survivors' in lean organisations. While some see WLB support as unaffordable, some HRM practitioners see flexible working arrangements as the only benefits they can offer during the recession and require information and support to enable this. The seminars will address these needs by disseminating up-to-date research on the impacts of the recession on WLB, diversity in employee experiences and needs, cost-effective ways of using flexible working and the consequences of such initiatives. This will feed into existing employer-led initiatives on defining and measuring the business case for WLB . Through information-sharing and stakeholder discussion, the seminars will also empower HRM professionals in making the case for maintaining WLB supports. 

The needs of the policy and business communities are linked. Policy makers and shapers whom we consulted note that changes in workplace cultures are needed to enhance the effectiveness of existing and planned WLB legislation and policy (e.g. on transferable maternity leave and flexible working). Many HRM professionals were frustrated, even before the recession, by the slow progress towards culture change on WLB, and are eager to discuss initiatives to overcome barriers to progress. The presentations and discussions on barriers to systemic organisational change, processes for challenging and overcoming these and innovative practices during the recession will provide opportunities for longer-term changes in workplace cultures. Discussions will also focus on whether innovations and good practices can be adapted in diverse workplace contexts in the recession. Papers on techniques for challenging gendered workplace assumptions and other barriers (seminar 6) will provide tools for embedding wider cultural change.

Finally, employees need opportunities for flexible working and other WLB supports but also confidence that they can use these without penalties, especially when jobs are perceived to be at risk. Employees and their advocates, e.g. unions, charities and NGOs, will benefit from information about the feasibility of WLB initiatives in the UK and beyond, e.g., on how to change culture and practice to support fathers' WLB without compromising workplace effectiveness or incurring costs. The seminars will provide them with information to enhance employee expectations and sense of entitlement to WLB support and could contribute to increased take-up and improved health and well-being.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23822</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Working Families</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Working Families in judging best employers for Working Families</gtr:description><gtr:id>2BA955F7-409D-4275-9EB2-6214D023289D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration led to new categories of awards added and the criteria for all awards being refined</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c364b93c8b32.60734977-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Working Families has a range of sponsored awards for which member organizations can apply</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Discussions at the seminars provided insights into criteria and processes involved in evaluating top employers in relation to their supports for working families and realisation of the triple agenda (a theme running through the seminars).

This proposal will build on this ESRC seminar series and publications resulting from this (i.e. a new 4* journal publication and a book). In this proposal, we aim to include a mixed-methods approach, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data on flexible working and work-life balance among public sector employees, with an additional focus on under-employment and social class during difficult economic times. The qualitative data would include interviews with both employees and line managers, which would directly complement the research with HR Directors already undertaken by members of the research team and presented during the seminar series. Brexit (and ongoing austerity) has also thrown up a new context from which to explore these issues. The team members have an excellent record in research funding and publications and are considering applications to the ESRC, the Nuffield Foundation or the Leverhulme Trust.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 4: Caring and work-life balance in austerity</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BFDF2FF-8A13-4038-B3AE-734125622CEE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The fourth seminar considered the impact of austerity and recession on caring and work-life balance. Three inter-related papers questioned and analysed caring and work-life balance issues in a time of austerity. Nicole Busby (University of Strathclyde) provided an overview of the UK's Coalition Government's austerity agenda, describing how it has provided justification for labour market deregulation alongside reductions in the welfare budget and cuts to public services which disproportionately affect women with caring responsibilities. The second speaker, Lydia Hayes (Cardiff University) focussed on the Care Act as a statute of austerity and its implications. Particularly for homecare workers, which threaten client care and carers' ability to support their own families - undermining all aspects of the triple agenda. Shereen Hussein (Kings College London) then drew on a longitudinal study of the social care workforce in the UK, noting that many care workers face various work stressors while providing highly emotional care work in their personal lives. 
A world caf&amp;eacute; break-out session provided opportunities to discuss practical implications and possible solutions for care and work-life balance. Topic discussed were 1. Carers and Employment: identifying key workplace-based initiatives/ideas that would help carers to balance care commitments with paid work, 2. Social Care: suggestions for improvements to social care which would better facilitate work-life balance for both carers and those requiring care, 3. Individual Care Needs: suggestions for improvements in identifying and meeting the care needs of individuals to enable independent living (i.e. employment opportunities, etc.) and 4. Care Work: how to improve the quality, experience and terms and conditions related to care work. Finally a roundtable discussion, led by practitioners from the CIPD, Single Parent Action Group, Unison, Carers UK plus a professor of economics from the Open University reflected on the seminar and the challenges for those interested in care and WLB in a time of austerity. 
More than 80% of the delegates who completed an evaluation form provided the highest rating to the following questions: information about the seminar was clear, organisation and structure of the seminar was effective, morning sessions were interesting and informative, and the world caf&amp;eacute; was thought provoking and well managed.

Delegates were less diverse than other seminars, suggesting that the topic has yet to reach a wider practitioner audience, although delegates included some representatives from unions and charities as well as researchers and consultants. The structure of this seminar differed from the others. There were five presentations. Thorsten Lunau from the University of Duesseldorf, Germany using data from the 2010 European working conditions survey noted great variation by country in terms of time based conflict, related to gender regimes. Rea Prouska from Middlesex University then presented qualitative data on work- life balance and quality of working life in Greece in times of financial crisis. A strong theme was that professionals are not immune to work-life balance problems , reporting working long and unsociable hours, but also feeling unable to provide the level of service needed in the austerity context. Fran McGinnity and Helen Russell from the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin presented data on gender, recession and work-life balance from the European Social Survey. Julia Fernando from the Kings Fund then presented internal NHS data on staff well-being, highlighting that funding pressures in the UK national health system will mean at least another five years of austerity. Presenteeism is a prominent feature in the NHS where staff work whilst sick. However, the research shows that good HR practice is key, and is linked to decreased patient mortality. Finally, Emma Donaldson-&amp;shy;Feilder from Affinity Health at Work discussed the importance of supporting line managers to enhance employee well-being and work-life balance, drawing on her practitioner research related to well-being and employee engagement. Emma reinforced the crucial role of supervisor relationships and line manager support for implementation of supportive workplace practices. However, she also raised caveats, as overly transformational leadership may lead to burnout. She argued that managers should not be blamed but need to receive support themselves. To close the day delegates were invited to reflect on what came out of the day's sessions. A number of themes emerged but the most persistent related to the role of the manager. It was argued that assumptions need to change so that promoting WLB should be an integral part of a managerial role. Work design and structure needs to be addressed from the recruitment stage onwards, so that WLB is embedded into all aspects of work. 
Feedback on the seminar was generally positive. More than 70% of the delegates who completed an evaluation form provided the highest rating to the following questions: information about the seminar was clear, organisation and structure of the seminar was effective and talks were interesting and informative. There were a range of additional comments such as appreciation for the good use of sticky notes and prompts to think of things learnt/new ideas/questions and many thanks for a useful and enjoyable day</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c32a7e7e2cb0.50863439</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.esrc-work-life-seminars.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 7: The future of work-life balance in austerity and beyond</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>48AEE45E-F48E-473B-A03C-435959BF3C18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The final seminar at Birkbeck, attended by a diverse group of academics and research students, employers, and representatives from unions, charities and professional organizations, the EHRC, the Ministry of Justice and consultants, revisited the current context and considered future directions. While the context of economic crisis had framed all previous sessions, this seminar began with two papers critically examining what is meant by crisis and some ramifications of current developments at the European level as they affect gender and WLB. Sylvia Walby (Lancaster University) explored ways in which the 'crisis' is restructuring the gender regime in Europe and some implications for work-life balance. Roberta Guerrina (University of Surrey) then expanded on socio-economic challenges to work-life balance in times of crisis in Europe, arguing that the 2008 financial crisis and the associated austerity measures have posed a serious challenge to gender equality objectives. Moving on from the focus on context to consider the impact of post-recession trends on work -life balance, Laura Den Dulk (from Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands) discussed self-employment which has grown and taken on many heterogeneous forms since the economic crisis. The final presentation by Ellen Kossek from Purdue University, USA explored a range of workplace interventions with the potential to meet the triple agenda in the future (building on seminar 5) . Breakout groups in the afternoon discussed some implications for the future in terms of: the social and workplace policies needed to address the triple agenda; ways of ensuring that gender is kept on the agenda in difficult economic times; ways of influencing future change; and what advice might be given to future generations facing economic challenges based on what we have learnt about WLB and the triple agenda from the current context. Finally, invited discussants from the Working Families helpline and Timewise, reflected on the day from the perspectives of vulnerable workers and in terms of the future of working time. 
A number of suggestions for future policy developments emerged from the day and included cutting the financial impediments to businesses so that, for example, it costs the same to employ 2 part-time workers as 1 full-time worker and making the right to request a work group, not individual, right, i.e., a collective request - the whole team to have the right to request a joint change to working patterns. This would help to move away from flexibility being positioned as solely an individual matter. Overall recommendations from the day included reframing the social justice and business case with more focus on social justice, which requires a shift in focus from the individual to the organisation. It was argued that social justice should be embedded whether in times of austerity or not.

They comprised academics, including PhD students and post docs, and representatives from the ACAS, Department of Work and Pensions, Local Government Association, Ford, Nomura, Wandsworth Council, Sheffield City Council, Health and Safety Laboratory, The Wainwright Trust, Working Families, One Plus One and several independent consultants. 
Presentations included WLB policies, practices and discourse and public sector cuts (Suzan Lewis, Middlesex University); Is WLB really family-friendly? (Dalia Ben-Galim, Institute of Public Policy Research); The place of gender equality in current WLB debates (Olga Salido, University of Madrid) and Working-time capabilities during economic austerity across Europe (Colette Fagan, University of Manchester). Discussants were Stephen Williams (ACAS) and Laura Addati (International Labour Organization). Discussions following presentations and breakout groups debated: the relationship between government policy and workplace practices, with a particular focus on issues raised by changes in the right to request flexible working; Individual versus collective or team approaches to WLB and work organisation, and impacts of unpaid care, including by grandparents, on paid work. There was a view that the Right to Request flexible working changes (extending this to all employees) need to be communicated better by Government and employers in order to manage the scaremongering about the changing legislation, flexibility generally among employers. It is important to work on showing how flexibility can be managed to meet the needs of both employees and employers. Although there were different views on whether there should be a limit to flexibility in workplaces, it was suggested that there is less likely to be a limit to flexible working if WLB is regarded as an issue of collective responsibility rather than an individual issue. This may require organisational change and increased team working.

Information about the seminars has been disseminated through a number of user organizations (as well as through our dedicated website http://www.esrc-work-life-seminars.org/ ). In particular it has stregthened the relationship between the participating universties and the charity Working Families Working Families has disseminated information about the seminar series to both its employer membership network (approximately 100 members) and also to the charity's wider employer and policy lists. These currently cover around 10,000 unique contacts, comprising large and small employers and policy specialists. Working Families has also carried information about each seminar on its website. Working Families also advises clients/members directly and through their helplines about the feasibility of and entitlements to WLB supports during austerity and beyond.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544fb8ccd365b0.02568278</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.esrc-work-life-seminars.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 2: Worklife balance, fairness and social justice during recession and austerity</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5FE7B144-838F-4263-9656-2D84A04C6E32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar 2 at the University of Manchester considered work-life balance, fairness and social justice during recession and austerity. It was attended by approximately 50 delegates including academics and students plus practitioners from the TUC, Greater Manchester for Voluntary Organizations, Equality and Human Rights Commission, Better Health, Social Enterprise North West, UCU, NW TUC Equality Forum, HSE Economic &amp;amp; Social Analysis Unit (ESAU) and UNISON. 
The seminar considered the following questions; is WLB becoming more difficult for everyone, or is the impact uneven? Are economic pressures reducing employers' willingness to implement WLB initiatives, or making it more difficult to do so? Which national and organizational WLB policies and services are resilient, which are adapting and which are being cut back? How do these developments impact on different groups of workers? Presentations included: recession, work-time and work-life balance: class inequalities in the UK (Tracey Warren, University of Nottingham); recent reforms in WLB policies in France: the ambivalent impact on parents in precarious work arrangements (Jeanne Fagnani, CNRS, Paris); long hours of work as a strategy for care dodging, (Mustafa Ozbilgin, University of Brunel) and austerity measures and access to justice following pregnancy related discrimination (Grace James, University of Reading). Greet Vermeylen (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, EuroFound), the discussant for the first session, commented on some findings from European work and conditions survey analysis. The final discussant, Jonathan Swan discussed Working Families' wide ranging research and work with employers and employees. Breakout sessions discussed: employer and government policies and practices that could address WLB issues faced by low paid workers and those with precarious jobs; reforms that are needed to eradicate pregnancy discrimination; what workplace policies and innovations might be useful to challenge the 'long hours culture' where it exists and other issues. Key recommendations included raising the minimum wage, strengthening contractual rights, ensuring all women are entitled to maternity leave and enhancing the availability, affordability, flexibility and quality of childcare especially for parents who work unsocial hours. Suggested reforms to eradicate pregnancy discrimination included abolishing tribunal fees, ensuring SME's know they can claim statutory maternity pay from government; raising awareness of pregnancy discrimination, including encouraging a change in public discourse from blame on employees/employers to identifying creative solutions and targeted training for line managers. Recommendations for workplace policies and innovations to challenge the 'long hours culture' where it exists included a combination of changing work patterns (e.g. flexible work, job redesign), and interventions aimed at changing workplace culture and individual behaviour, based on a collectivist approach.

Feedback on the seminar was sought via an evaluation form. More than 80% of the delegates who completed this provided the highest rating to the following questions: information about the seminar was clear, organisation and structure of the seminar was effective, morning sessions were interesting and informative, and break-out groups were thought provoking and well managed. An example additional comment was: &amp;quot;How to engage with employers and discuss solutions to improve work-life balance barriers and opportunities. There was lots of fantastic energy/information/understanding about how this can translate into practice&amp;quot;.

We were invited to run a symposium on work-life balance in the recession and beyond at the International Work Family Researchers Network conference in New York. Papers presented in the symposium were based on the seminar papers but were also developed to incorporate issues raised by practitioner delegates.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544fbd10ba9861.42110194</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.esrc-work-life-seminars.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 5: Innovation in workplaces</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>55CBFCA9-4B5D-4FBB-AFAC-6EBC2F5B931E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar 5, hosted by EY in London brought together approximately 35 researchers, practitioners and relevant user community representatives (including a number of MDs and HR Directors) to seek solutions to a 'triple agenda': how to enhance employees' work-life balance (WLB), organisational effectiveness and social justice in times of austerity. All the speakers demonstrated how it is possible to change assumptions about how work should be done. In the first talk Hyosun Kim, from Chung Ang University, Korea introduced the approach of Collaborative Interactive Action Research (CIAR) and the dual and triple agendas of gender equity and workplace effectiveness. She described the CIAR process and presented case studies of CIAR projects in hospitals with successful outcomes including changes in working practices to address staff turnover problems which enhanced both employee and patient satisfaction and reduced patient waiting times for patients and optimised patient context. The second speaker Charlotte Gascoigne (a flexible working consultant) challenged assumptions that part time work is not possible or suitable for managerial and professional workers. Based on a study of part time managers she described four stages of development of part time working arrangement by trail blazers which can start to shift workplace cultures. Part time work came to be viewed as a resource issue, not a value exchange. Ways of changing workplace cultures were also discussed by Craig Morris, (Scottish Government) who described current policies and flexible working options as well as ongoing developments in workplace transformation and location neutral initiatives. Finally Ziona Strelitz (ZZAResponsive User Environments) discussed trends in innovative forms of distributed and remote work with potential to meet the dual or triple agenda although more research is needed on such outcomes. The talks were followed by a break out session in which practical implications for employers to meet the triple agenda were discussed. One question addressed how employers can maintain an innovative approach to ensure new working practices meet the needs of all employees. It was felt that property and infrastructure issues were often divorced from the people agenda within organisations. These two aspects need to work much more closely together, and it is probable that HR needs to be able to summon metrics and evidence to match the arguments of property and business services departments. A second question considered how innovations in working practices can address structural social inequalities and support access to social justice, and whether organizations should have this on their agenda. It was felt that a key concept in achieving more social justice is for the idea of neutrality to come to the fore: neutrality in terms of access to flexible working, work location and hours worked. Finally invited discussants (Sarah Jackson, Working Families; Caroline Waters, EHRC/Carers UK; Ian Greenaway, MTM Products; Craig Morris, Scottish Government), drawing upon their own experiences, views and knowledge, offered particular insights on innovative processes for building an organisational culture and working practices that delivered the dual and triple agenda. From a small business perspective, this meant a management approach that took as its default position a positive stance on flexible working. All arrangements were acceptable unless proven to be detrimental. In larger organisations, predicting the needs of a future workforce had determined extensions to flexible and remote working to employees on a large scale. However, in addition to essential HR work there was also a need for sustained cultural work, including engaging employees in their new workplaces and working styles, and understanding that 'hearts and minds' activities were essential.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c3292131e7a1.84992051</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.esrc-work-life-seminars.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 3: Employment relations and workplace initiatives</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF2A6439-C40C-4A1C-B7E2-C2CC07086E17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar 3, on employment relations and workplace initiatives was held at the University of Warwick. Approximately 35 delegates were from UNISON, TUC, UCU, HSE, Wright Hassall, One plus One and Working Families, plus universities and research centres. 
Presentations and discussions considered the role of employment relations and workplace initiatives in seeking solutions to the &amp;quot;triple agenda&amp;quot; of how to enhance employees' Work-Life Balance (WLB), organisational effectiveness and social justice. Three papers were presented, one, by Lucy Stokes (National Institute of Economic and Social Research), providing an overview of new research from the 2011 Workplace Employment Relations Study (WERS) and two presenting more detailed sectoral research focusing on a) WLB among civil servants (Steve French, Keele University), and b) trade union interventions in WLB, with a specific focus on the grocery and print media sectors (Mike Rigby, London South Bank University). Two discussants, Sally Brett from the TUC and John Purcell, Deputy Chairman of the Central Arbitration Committee and ACAS arbitrator also added to the debate and stimulated a lively discussion within breakout sessions. The group discussions picked up on some of the key issues raised by the seminar speakers and provided examples of HR, line manager and union interventions which could provide a support system for individual employees, at a time when WLB has been slipping down the agenda for employers and is being seen more and more as an issue to be addressed by the individual, rather than by the organisation.

Feedback on the seminar was sought via an evaluation form. More than 80% of the delegates who completed this provided the highest rating to the following questions: information about the seminar was clear, organisation and structure of the seminar was effective, morning sessions were interesting and informative, and break-out groups were thought provoking and well managed. No delegates disagreed with these statements.

Information about the seminars has been disseminated through the British Psychological Society Division of Occupational Psychology work-life balance working group's biennial publication and mailing lists. Consultants and Organizational and Occupational Psychologists who are group members or affiliates will be provided with enhanced knowledge and skills to work directly with employers on WLB and flexible working during austerity and beyond.

1. Facilitating multi stakeholder discussions of work-life balance (WLB) in austerity and beyond, embedding issues of fairness and social justice. 
The seminar series encouraged multi stakeholder discussions of WLB in austerity and beyond, embedding issues of fairness and social justice. The main achievement was to broaden discussion of WLB from a narrow focus on mutual benefit of policies and practices for employers and employees, to a triple agenda of seeking to support employee WLB (and well-being), workplace effectiveness and social justice. Explicitly bringing fairness, social justice and especially gender justice into discussion appears to be more challenging. This is evidenced, for example, by the relative neglect of precarious and other vulnerable workers in discussions of WLB, by changes in the law that disproportionately affect working carers and by the difficulties that some employers experience in accepting or articulating the social justice aspect of workplace WLB practices. Recommendations from mixed academic/practitioner discussion groups in the final seminar included the need to change the social conversation and terms of the WLB debate to include social justice. This involves reframing the social justice and business case and the triple agenda as being good for everyone, whether in times of austerity or not. It was deemed likely however that the reconstruction of WLB debates around a specific triple agenda will be a long term project

2. Facilitating the emergence of some practical recommendations for specific changes in social policy and workplace practices.
The triple agenda for WLB requires a shift in focus from the individual to the organisation. The academic-practitioner dialogues, including world caf&amp;eacute;s and other discursive processes, facilitated the emergence of some practical recommendations for specific changes in social policy and workplace practices. These included, for example, making the right to request flexible working a collective (e.g. work team) rather than just an individual entitlement, and the collaboration of academic and third sector organizations in providing evidence of health and societal costs of neglecting WLB issues in terms which policy makers and business leaders can accept and act upon.

3. Demonstrating to a multi stakeholder audience the value of action research processes for developing workplace innovations to support the triple agenda for WLB.
The seminar series provided evidence that action research, involving collaboration between researchers, employers and employees, can challenge taken-for-granted assumptions and develop workplace innovations to meet the needs of multiple stakeholders. Evidence was provided from government supported research in South Korea and the USA. For example, following an action research process the introduction of a new short day shift for nurses with the most pressing work-family needs reduced staff turnover, benefiting nurses and patients in South Korea.

4. Raising new questions for research and public policy debates.
The seminar series has raised new research questions about processes for developing innovative workplace practices for supporting the triple agenda, which recognise the potential unintended consequences of, for example, flexible working solutions, if fairness is excluded. It also raises questions about the role of the state in ensuring that social justice is embedded in both public policy and workplace practice.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic route
? More focus on workers who are often neglected in WLB research, including those in precarious and low paid work, or those combining paid and unpaid care, and the organizational as well as social benefits of WLB supports for these workers.
? Research examining the outcomes of workplace WLB practices adopted and/or adapted to manage austerity from the perspectives of employees, employers and social advocacy groups. 
? Organizational action research, involving collaborative problem solving, seeking solutions to individual, workplace and social problems might produce innovative interventions which can be monitored and evaluated by different stakeholders. 

Stakeholder route
? Charities and advocacy groups might work with employers who experience difficulty in articulating the social justice element of the triple agenda, producing evidence based case studies of the overall benefits, even during a time of austerity. 
? The charity Working Families has a large employer members base and also an employee helpline receiving many calls from vulnerable workers, so is in a key position to understand impacts of austerity on employees and employers and to promote the benefits of a triple agenda approach via user engagement. 
? Policy makers should consider the policy implications of a triple agenda for WLB during austerity and beyond.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F2D60AAC-BEF1-44A7-87DF-9989A45ABAE6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb182f559f96.77281983</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
