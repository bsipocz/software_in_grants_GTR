AS is a new silver alloy, which was developed to combat an oxidation process called 'fire scale', which occurs when standard Sterling Silver (SS) is heated during the fabrication process. Fire scale appears as bluish-grey stains in the surface of SS and is difficult to remove. AS has been recognised for being firescale-free but also for other advantages. \n \nThis proposal has arisen from an initial exploration by Niedderer (Niedderer, Harrison &amp;amp; Johns 2006), which tested the performance of AS in the context of practice, and which suggested that the combined use of AS with new technologies could offer potential for new developments in silver design. One such technology is laser welding, which can be used successfully with AS but not with SS due to differences in material properties. \n \nThe benefit of laser welding is in minimal heat application which allows the use of thin, flexible, work-hardened material. In contrast, traditional soldering requires heating the whole piece during fabrication, softening the silver. Any design using soldering therefore has to use sheet material of sufficient thickness to avoid easy indentation within use, commonly ranging between 0.8-1.5mm (e.g. works by Michael Rowe, Simone Ten Hompel, Alessi Tea &amp;amp; Coffee Towers). This makes silverware expensive and puts a range of constraints on the design and production of silverware, because pieces made of thinner material may distort during heating, need to be work-hardened after the last soldering stage, or need to be filled with supporting material (pitch). \n \nThis project proposes to investigate the combined use of AS and laser welding for developing new avenues in silver design. The focus will be on the use of thin, hard rolled sheet material using laser welding in the design and production of hollowware. The research will be conducted through creative practice set within a robust historical/theoretical framework. The framework will be developed from a comparison of the characteristics of 20th/21st Century examples of silver design, which will be selected and analysed according to criteria of technological, conceptual, and aesthetic developments. The comparison will identify the technological and conceptual conditions under which a design is considered to be 'contemporary' and 'advanced' in its time, thus providing a framework for 'new avenues' that will inform, guide and be used to validate the directions chosen in the practical inquiry. \n \nThe practical inquiry will explore the relationship of fabrication methods, and of aesthetic and conceptual expression. Creative practice and technical experimentation will be used to identify and explore different ways of joining AS through laser welding and to analyse the aesthetic results and expression. The results will be compared with insights gained from the theoretical inquiry in order to develop new avenues. A number of ideas will be realised to test and demonstrate both process and results. The project will conclude with an evaluation of the outcomes of the practice phase against the criteria developed in the theoretical framework. \n\nThe outcomes of the project will comprise a review of the development of 20th/21st Century silver design with regard to technical and aesthetic/conceptual advancements. It will generate an understanding of how to bring about new developments in silver design based on the relation of technical advance and conceptual/aesthetic concerns and produce recommendations for, and examples of, new avenues for silver design through the combined use of AS and laser welding. The outcomes will be published through conference and journal papers, and through exhibition of the practice work, including research process, designs, and contextual materials, at Birmingham Museum &amp;amp; Art Gallery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16335</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Fruit Bowl 1 and Fruit Bowl 2, 2009
Argentium&amp;copy; Sterling Silver

The two fruit bowls develop ideas explored in Anemone and introduce them into silver design and production.

Using the same method of star-shaped layering, the two fruit bowls exploit the flexibility of the hard-rolled Argentium&amp;copy; silver to create elastic constructions that are seemingly alive. The stitch-like welds are clearly visible, and an inherent part of the design.

The two bowls transform in use. When laden with apples, their shape transforms, and through both form and movement, they are able to evoke a number of different emotions and create expressions, including joy, uncertainty, protection, etc.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1A984801-D23B-4D7C-8241-6FF199D5B7A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The insights gained, especially from Fruitbowl 1, have led to a new theory on designing emotional responses through movement (see journal article),which has been recognised, e.g. through further reaching collaborations into new materials and technologies, and research into emotional experiences through design.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-6487633666.4777565a6e6ad5a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Fruit Bowl 1 and Fruit Bowl 2</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://niedderer.org/creative2.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Research Exhibition at the Silver Gallery, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham, UK, September 2009 - May 2010.</gtr:description><gtr:id>24C1BD0E-C6DB-4D5D-B472-57A4F80136B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition aimed at informing the wider public of the outcomes of the project.

Argentium&amp;copy; Sterling Silver, 

Anemone explores the combined use of Argentium&amp;copy; and laser welding on a consciously sculptural level.

'How can we bring silver alive?' is an important question. Traditional silver is solid, often highly polished, and finished to perfection. Much contemporary silver has attempted to break away from this image either through a deliberate lack of finish, or through deconstructing the surface. 

Anemone develops these ideas. The joining of very thin strips of metal (0.1mm thick) through laser welding, allows the flowery forms to become 'alive'. The patinated surface of Anemone 2 emphasises its sculptural quality. The organic shapes, fragile-looking, but strong and flexible, react to any disturbance in the room with a slight vibration.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C5719B8D-269D-4B86-AB5C-DD9B22A1F3EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The insights gained have led to a new theory on designing emotional responses through movement (see journal article), ,which has been recognised, e.g. through further reaching collaborations into new materials and technologies, and research into emotional experiences through design.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-334597817.0024211a70b8cce</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Anemone 1 and Anemone 2</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://niedderer.org/creative2.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Trio 1 and Trio 2, 2009
Argentium&amp;copy; Sterling Silver

Trio 1 and Trio 2 show a progressive sophistication in the use of laser welding and thin, hard-rolled Argentium&amp;copy; metal sheet. The development of these forms sought to test the potential of this combination of material and technique.

Joints, for example, have to be constructed differently from traditional, soldered seams. Here in Duo and Trio 1, as in paper cut-outs, flanges provide a key for the welding joins. The effects of these new constructional requirements have to be integrated into the design, even, in Trio 1, developed as decorative elements. For example, Duo still has a traditionally inserted base, while Trio 1 extends the idea of using flanges for the purpose of joining the different parts as well as for creating decorative features. Flanges can also be extended to provide material for the handles. The thin hard material and straight shapes give the cups a technical feel, while the welding seams have the character of sewing or stitching. With their intertwining handles, the small cups convey a somewhat comic-strip-like character.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FB344684-C30A-4974-8ECB-6A96CE5BB14A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The insights gained have led to further reaching collaborations into new materials and technologies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-5866851793.478105a714ff0c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Trio 1 and Trio 2</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://niedderer.org/creative2.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has various influences outside academia:

1)
It aimed at informing the wider public of the outcomes of the project through the exhibition at the Metalwork Gallery, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham, UK, which is one of the most prominent places in the country for the history and development of metalwork and silver design. It has provided the best possible context for presenting the work informing a wide audience about the use of new materials (Argentium silver) and new technologies (laser welding) and the design opportunities arising from the combined use of both. This is particularly important in a town where the silver and jewellery industry is still vital part of the economy. This importance has been recognised through a number of design magazines which will be featuring the exhibition of my research work (e.g. Style Birmingham magazine, January 2010; Midlands Homes and Interiors magazine; February 2010), in addition to peer-reviewed publications.

2)
Through the exhibition, research publications, and online publicity, the research outcomes have been publicly available to professional silversmith and silver companies, e.g. Argentium Co. Ltd. which holds the international patents on Argentium and its producers in a number of ways:
- Some of the work is or has been featured in the Argentium gallery: http://www.argentiumsilver.com as well as in the Argentium Guild Newsletter (1).
- One of the earlier pieces has won an Argentium guild award, which was featured in their newsletter (2) http://www.argentiumguild.com/ 
- Anemone 1 and 2 were selected through competition for the 16th Silver Triennial, a European touring exhibition organised by the Gesellschaft f?r Goldschmiedekunst (include. International Trade Fair Frankfurt/Main and Inhorgenta M?nchen), documented in: 
Weber-St?ber, C. (ed). (2010). 16th Silver Triennial 2010. Hanau, Germany: Gesellschaft f?r Goldschmiedekunst &amp;amp; Kulturamt Hanau, p. 84.

3) 
An important recognition of the project has been the invitation by Intellect Publishers to develop the new journal 'CRAFT RESEARCH', which was launched in September 2010 in the UK, and in October 2010 in the USA through special activities at the Design and Emotion Conference, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. Craft Research is the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to the development and advance of contemporary craft practice and theory through research, which seeks to portray and build the crafts as a vital and viable modern discipline that offers a vision for the future. The journal is held by the V&amp;amp;A and the American Crafts Council as well as 40 Institutions worldwide.

The project has led to new collaborations, e.g. with engineering at UoW, Argentium Ltd., Electro Optical Systems (EOS), Middlesex University, and to the development of further research into Argentium and new technologies, now focusing on Direct Metal Laser Sintering. This research has been so successful that it is now being developed commercially.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>59AB0BE9-64CD-440B-999A-4B23EAB55919</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5425303989f186.55649786</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project was to develop new avenues for contemporary silver design in the light of new opportunities arising from the combined use of Argentium Sterling Silver (AS) and laser welding.

This project investigated the combined use of AS and laser welding for developing new avenues in silver design.

The outcome of the research was an enhanced understanding of the technical and conceptual issues of using elasticity and movement to create emotional expression in silver design, enabled by the combination of Argentium silver and laser welding. In particular the study highlighted how complex emotions can be embodied in design objects, stressing the need for future research to develop a broader spectrum and vocabulary of complex emotional expression. The outcomes have been published through 2 conference/journal papers, and through exhibition of the practice work, including research process, designs, and contextual materials, at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has various influences outside academia:

It has offered information and awareness about the new use of Argentium silver and laser welding to professional silversmith and silver companies. It was publicised through the exhibition at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and further international touring exhibitions (16th Silvertriennial 2010); through publication in several magazines and newspapers and exhibition catalogues, including Style Birmingham magazine, January 2010; Midlands Homes and Interiors magazine; February 2010; the Guardian magazine 2010.

This research has been so successful that it is now being developed commercially.

The insights regarding practice-led research in the crafts have led to establishing the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to the development and advance of contemporary craft practice and theory through research. The journal is held worldwide by over 40 institutions, including the V&amp;amp;A and the American Craft Council. It offers both a unique forum for craft researches to publish and for craft research to be made available to the wider public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>187C7DD0-5988-4C6A-B0FC-2F0671EC89CC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1364436188.1208012775fb20e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://niedderer.org/creative2.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36DB0935-7D15-412C-BDFE-B00F328F74D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring Elasticity as a Medium for Emotional Expression in Silver Design</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Design</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8b5d1dcd53e76d71c21acffcf2b01451"><gtr:id>8b5d1dcd53e76d71c21acffcf2b01451</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Kristina Niedderer (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_9057039245139c4d62</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7D49FC0B-8138-4177-ADCB-50E29D099323</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sustainability of Craft as a Discipline?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3563d47cf6d99377b6e1c76ab004ac90"><gtr:id>3563d47cf6d99377b6e1c76ab004ac90</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Niedderer K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5425332851bf93.71562760</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6776D784-D8EC-433C-B73B-1BEB05875671</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring Elasticity as a Medium for Emotional Expression in Silver Design</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3563d47cf6d99377b6e1c76ab004ac90"><gtr:id>3563d47cf6d99377b6e1c76ab004ac90</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Niedderer K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542532a22129a6.94568855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G001073/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>287497FB-DD4A-44CC-AC13-DBAFADC9AD82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
