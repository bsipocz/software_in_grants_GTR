It is characterized by problems with using and understanding spoken language, in the absence of obvious causes such as deafness. The disorder is 'hidden', in that affected individuals do not have any marked visible features distinguishing them from other children. Among 5-year-olds, approximately 7% have LI - seven times more prevalent than autism. Children affected by LI often experience social, emotional health, and educational problems. As adults, many will struggle to find stable employment and are at increased risk of social dysfunction and mental health difficulties. Despite the serious implications of the condition for children and their families, LI is little known among the general community. 
 
LI is a varied disorder, with different children manifesting different profiles of associated difficulties. Not all children go on to have poor outcomes. For example, some may have behavioural difficulties whilst others do not. Determining what makes different children vulnerable is challenging. The project will make use of genetic-risk information and data from the first 2 years of child's life (such as number of books in the household, socioeconomic status etc.) to classify children into sub-groups, using a statistical method known as latent class analysis. This will allow the investigation of whether belonging to certain sub-groups affects outcomes in middle childhood. For example, it may be that the children with a high genetic risk and a favourable home environment have comparable outcomes to those children with low genetic risk and a favourable home environment. If this does prove to be the case, it would suggest that genetic risk can be mitigated by a favourable home environment. This would provide evidence to target resources towards the most vulnerable children to improve their quality of life.

The project will also identify the pathways to poor outcomes in social adjustment, educational attainment and mental health functioning. For example, it may be that children with high genetic risk and a unfavourable home environment have behavioural difficulties and emotional problems in middle childhood. Pathway analyses afford the examination of multiple factors and different potential routes: how children may get from A to B. It also affords the evaluation of the strength of different pathways and the assessment of the extent to which outcomes in different areas of functioning derive from common or distinctive routes. Part of the strength of this proposal is the inclusion of a variety of factors: genetic, environmental, and psychological in the same model. The economic cost associated with language impairment has been estimated at 2.5% of gross national product. Evidence on the pathways to adverse outcomes will have wide ranging implications for public health measures and service provision. 
 
This type of project requires large numbers of participants. Approval has been granted to use the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). This is an existing, epidemiological database that has records for ~7,000 children so no new data collection is needed for the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH

Three groups of stakeholders have been identified: 
1) affected children, their parents and other family members 
2) relevant early years professionals/practitioners (professionals in CAMHS, e.g., child psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and in education/allied health, e.g., teachers, Educational Psychologists, SENCOs, speech and language therapists) 
3) third sector charities, professional associations 
 
HOW WILL THESE GROUPS BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH? 
We recognise that translational data should be readily understandable to the potential beneficiaries of the research. Below, we illustrate some of the likely benefits that the proposed research provides. 
 
1) Parents of children with Language Impairment (LI) will benefit from the research. If the hypotheses are supported, using the communicative environment variables, the project will be able to identify the specific aspects of a child's early communicative environment that promote positive outcomes. 

For example, it may be that a combination of reading to the child, owning a number of books, and child-mother interaction lessen the effects of genetic risk. If this is the case, the project will inform separately funded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which will equip parents to implement these practices within the first two years of a child's life. Implementing these changes will improve the quality of life in the most vulnerable children and improve their life outcomes. 

2) The project will inform practice for early years practitioners. It is currently unknown who will spontaneously resolve as findings from previous risk factor factor research is contradictory. If it proves to be the case that the effects of genetic risk are lessened with a favourable early communicative environment, then RCTs can be commissioned to establish how professionals such as health visitors can educate parents on the importance of early communicative environment or how they can be part of delivering the interventions. The analysis strategy allows the most vulnerable children to be identified. These will be cost efficient interventions, as they will be targeted at the most vulnerable groups rather than population-wide. 
 
3) Foster dialogue between third sector charities and professional bodies regarding oral language, LI, and associated difficulties in middle childhood. Similar to the relevant early years professionals/practitioners, third sector charities, such as I-CAN and AFASIC, will be able to use the findings of the research to educate parents about the specific aspects of a child's early communicative environment that are beneficial in lessening the impact of the genetic risk of LI. 

The charities are well placed to support those who are hard to reach because they are unable or unwilling to access support. For example, PI Toseeb is already working with a local charity, Manchester Dyslexia Self Help Group; to understand the barriers to accessing support services for certain sub-groups within the community. This has enabled closer links to other charities who support those with language disorders. 
 
WHAT WILL BE DONE TO FOSTER IMPACT? 
A full description of the plans for impact is available in the Pathways to Impact Document attached to this application. Below, we provide a brief summary of what will be done during the lifetime of the project only. 
 
A dissemination event will be held towards the end of the project to communicate the findings of the project to a non-academic audience. Representatives from all three key stakeholders (parents, professionals, &amp;amp; charities) will take part in the event. The event will be followed by a roundtable discussion with selected representatives, which will allow for a discussion of how the different stakeholders can work together to implement the findings of the project into practice</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161348</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P001955/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>24C2FD61-D899-497D-8F52-D8C590EAD745</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Child Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>544E9837-9640-4AAB-93EB-416962206DD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education and School</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A4209D5A-2E41-4290-9D1A-3172C1F48962</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Genetics/Evolution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
