It investigates the financial costs of imprisonment to the country (and the human costs to those imprisoned) and does this over a significant period of time (allowing an examination of how repeated incarcerations affected the whole of an offender's criminal career). It concludes by asking what lessons can be learnt for today's debates about sentencing offenders and managing the prison population? &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>232673</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A 'Persistence from the Past': The Prison in Historical Perspective</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>86C21385-F922-49DC-B3D4-BF0F8AE66BBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Morris and Rothman observe that for some people the most novel contribution of their work 'may well be to demonstrate that prisons do have a history' (1998: vii).

Academics:
We will make a contribution to the field in the next 24 months by publishing a book (proposal to be submitted Palgrave); we have been invited to contribute to two edited collections; and we will submit articles to major history/criminology journals. Conference papers were presented at the Social Science History Association (Boston, USA), British Crime Historians Conference, European Society of Criminology (Bilbao, Spain), European Social Science History Conference (Glasgow). Seminars papers on research findings and methodologies were also given at the Universities of Victoria, NZ; Leeds; Sheffield; Cambridge; Keele; Liverpool and Hull. We also organised three postgraduate workshops (Keele, Hull, Liverpool).

Campaigners/Policymakers
We organised a four day international conference 'Modern Activism' at St George's Hall, Liverpool, June 2012 which linked historians with policymakers and campaigners. Speakers included: Frances Crook (Howard League for Penal Reform), Lesley Adbela (Shevolution Consultancy), President and President-elect of Magistrates Association, Richard Monkhouse &amp;amp; John Thornhill, environmental activist Mike Leach as well as representatives from Police Federation, Liverpool Cathedral Constabulary, the Prison Service (NB location was Liverpool rather than London due to high costs during Olympics). The findings were presented to the Cabinet, MPs, and policy makers at the Ministry of Justice, NZ. We have worked with the Magistrates Association and the Howard League for Penal Reform, Denbighshire Magistrates, Willaston History Society, Womens' Register and the WI. We have produced short accessible articles aiming at the public linking this project to contemporary penal issues (http://www.liv.ac.uk/law-and-social-justice/news/). We have also produced a piece on short sentences which will be distributed to Howard League for Penal Reform members, and a `Counterblast' essay for the Howard Journal for Autumn 2013 publication.

Public:
Organised one day conference for the public, 'Researching Criminal and Prison Lives', London Metropolitan Archives. This was a well received event with 40-50 people attending and one day event with the Black Country History Society (again 40/50 attendees). We also produced short accessible articles aiming at the public linking this project to contemporary penal issues (Viewpoints by Godfrey, http://www.liv.ac.uk/law-and-social-justice/news/), and a piece on 'Convict Prison Lives' (London Metropolitan Archives website at http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/visiting-the-city/archives-and-city-history/london-metropolitan-archives/news-and-events/Pages/Convict-prison-lives.aspx) which links this research to family history and accessing historical documents on imprisonment and crime. We have now produced a 'popular' history book aimed at the public and published by Pen &amp;amp; Sword / Wharncliffe in 2016 titled, Victorian Convicts: 100 Criminal Lives.

In addition case studies of convicts lives from this project have been used in the following publication, Johnston, H.

Between 1856 and 1940 the costs of the convict system averaged &amp;pound;218k per year. In the decade from 1880 to 1890 the cost per prisoner rose from &amp;pound;32 to &amp;pound;42. Each prison had a budget, which varied considerably, but were all under pressure to reduce costs. Aside from the disruptions around WWI, the figure stayed at around that rate until the late 1920s. After the prison closures that happened then, the costs was an average of &amp;pound;140 per prisoner throughout the 1930s). By the start of WWII the costs of the whole system was still &amp;pound;240k per year, not far off the &amp;pound;226k it had cost in 1856, despite the vast reduction in convicts over that period. The prison system has always been (and continues to be) very expensive.

* Did the licence system act as a financial pressure-valve?
The increase in the numbers of prisoners between 1856 and the 1880s were unsupportable without an early-release scheme being in operation. Without licensing, the average daily prison population would have been increased by one-third (and almost all prisoners were licensed, even those imprisoned for manslaughter and rape). The pressure-valve was opened more when the crisis became acute in the 1870s and 1880s, and, in fact, after 1882, the convict establishments became net exporters of prisoners (aside from a `blip' between 1900 and 1903). The license system was a pressure valve which operated in order to make the prison system manageable (and operating at a much-reduced cost).

* What impact did imprisonment/licensing have on re-offending? Did the licence system `work' at the individual level?
The licensing system reduced the period in custody and therefore allowed more time for desistence factors to be put in place; it also reduced the impact of processes of institutionalisation. At the level of the individual, the licensing system itself was of no intrinsic value, except to act as a temporal window which allowed more supportive processes to get to work outside of the prison gates.

* What was the impact of short/long sentences on re-offending rates?
Until 1885 the average sentence for indictable offences was steady (10-12 months per offence). After 1885 the average fell to around 8mths by the 1890s. From 1885, the average sentence for summary offences rose from 0.8 months to 1.2 months. The vast number of prisoners served short sentences. The speed of reconviction was generally high. 65% of offenders who received a short sentence reoffended within 5 months. For convicts, over the course of their lives, there was a reconviction rate of 80%. Convicts who were imprisoned for longer than ten years tended to not-reoffend, and the effect of 20 year sentences was marked, but only because of their age/infirmity on release, and because they were incapable of either continuing their offending, or any semblance continuing a normal life. Their lives were broken by that stage.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In particular our further use and development of whole life methodology in the reconstruction of the lives of
