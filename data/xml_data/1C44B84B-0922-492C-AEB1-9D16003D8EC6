Such a focus will allow for both a range of conceptual debates on territorial approaches to economic development, fiscal federalism, the nature and fluidity of 'borders' and the creation of more flexible approaches to governance; and the potential to shape policy-making in an area and at a time where the nature of the inter-relationship (and the opportunities it offers) remains to be decided.&lt;br />&lt;br />The seminar series will consist of six events over a two year period.The topics to be covered are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the historical and cultural context&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>developments in governance and governing&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>economic development&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>changes in levels of fiscal autonomy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>lessons from international experiences&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>implications for politics and policy-making.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;In addition to academics, the engagement of practitioners and policy-makers is also a feature of the series. The last event, timed to take place early in 2015, will allow for post-referendum reflection and analysis which engages politicians and policy-makers from both sides of the Border.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Directed from Northumbria University by Professor Keith Shaw, but also drawing into its orbit academic colleagues from the University of Cumbria, Edinburgh College of Art, the University of Oxford, and from University College London, this Seminar Series will encourage a systematic, wide-ranging and comparative exploration of the impact of a more autonomous Scotland on the North of England. By its very nature and timeliness, the emphasis of the Series will be on bringing into dialogue the theorisations of the widest cross-section of academics; and the changing political and policy contexts with which a broad cohort of policy makers and practitioners operate. Hence, whilst catering for a large and interdisciplinary audience of academics, the perspectives and positionalities of a broad base of non-academics will also inflect the discussions; indeed, the ratio of academics to non-academics will be fixed, for each of the events, at 60:40. This could be inverted, however, in the case of the final event (event 6), which we expect to mobilise a large and distinguished community of senior civil servants from key government departments, including the Cabinet Office, HM Treasury and CLG, as well as those responsible for and/or aligned with key sub-national functions such as skills, transport, tourism, and renewables. 

It is the applicants' intention that, as well as inputting to the Series as 'speakers', non-academics will also assist in and contribute to the develop of a series of written reflections on the issues broached, including those featuring in a special feature edition of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) journal, Juncture. Further, given the richness of the Series' conceptual underpinnings, the timeliness of the bid, and the level of interest in the issue of Scottish independence, it is planned that longer and more analytical articles will be produced for a special edition of a leading academic journal, such as Regional Studies or Urban Studies. Once again, every effort will be made to accommodate involvements from senior civil servants and/or ministers. 

Syntheses of the above articles will manifest in a series of short (2 page) policy briefings made available to relevant stakeholders in both 'glossy' format and via the Series' dedicated website. Serving as an archive to the various 'Powerpoint' presentations and recordings extracted from the six events, this will also link to and promote a newly-established blog. Oriented towards an informed but non-specialist audience, the blog will provide a 'live' forum for those concerned with and affected by the issues constituting the Series' programme, and a platform from which to promote a number of public communication and public engagement activities; including film screenings, public lectures, a 'borderland' walk, and a public debate. 

These and other activities will be steered at a strategic level by steering committee uniting academics (e.g. Professor John Mawson, Director, Institute for Local Governance for the North East), policy makers Melanie Laws (Chief Executive, Association of North East Councils) and practitioners (Jonathan Blackie (consultant; former Director of Government Office for the North East).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16558</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Borderlands Summit April 3/4th 2014 (Cardrona Hotel, Peebles)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>06BF91F4-8C48-4691-9501-01D73322C4FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keith Shaw provided the research context and faciliated the two-day summit of the Leaders and Chief Executives of the five local authorities along the Border (Northumberland, Cumbria, Carlisle, Dumfries and Galloway, Borders), the Scottish Government and the Association of North East Councils.

- The study, published in November 2015, provided comparative economic and social data which served as an in-depth and independent evidence base on which a collaborative approach for the Borderlands could be developed and promoted by the combined efforts of the 5 councils and their partners. In particular, the study identified opportunities for collaboration particularly in relation to Energy, Forestry, Tourism, and Connectivity. 

- Both Keith Shaw and Frank Peck presented findings from the research at the Conference, 'Can Rural areas of Northern England benefit from a Borderlands approach' - at the Institute for Local Governance conference on Rural Growth, held at Kirkley Hall, Northumberland in October 2015. 

- In November 2015, the announcement of the Devolution Deal for the North East Combined Authority highlighted the importance of developing the cross-border relationship with Scotland. 

- The Mansio Project, a bespoke and innovative mobile venue that toured important urban and rural sites along Hadrian's Wall during the summer of 2016 drew on the anglo-scottish border focus via Keith Shaw's invited contribution. 

- Further developments in relation to The Borderlands Initiative are expected in late 2016. One recent development - which has the potential to incorporate the cross-border approach outlined in the original project - is the Border Uplands Development initaitive (from DEFRA).

Rediscovering the significance of the 'Borderlands'

While the potential for cross-border collaboration has been discussed during the last decade, the contributions to the seminar series both provided a firm evidence-base, and a detailed 'route-map', through which such collaboration could take place. In particular, seminars 2, 3, and 4 produced knowledge that underpinned a new understanding of the economic and social links between the 'Borderlands' i.e. the area covered by the Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Cumbria and Northumberland. In using and interpreting new data, the seminars provided the economic case for collaboration and, in outlining the options for a new Borderlands partnership, also contributed to the debate on governance. Proposals for a Borderland's approach have now been taken forward by public bodies on both sides of the Border on the basis of: collaboration across key economic sectors, such as Tourism, Energy and Forestry; the opportunities provided by the distinct &amp;quot;brand identity&amp;quot; of the place; and the need for &amp;quot;joined-up&amp;quot; approaches to infrastructure and connectivity. Lessons drawn from case experiences in Europe helped to inform these deliberations.

2. Enhancing the Inter-disciplinary study of Borders

Drawing upon insights from a range of disciplines, including social sciences, history, creative arts and cultural studies, the seminars provided a forum for the critical discussion of the &amp;quot;territorialist epistemology&amp;quot; which dominates many studies of borders. A key message from the seminars was that the Anglo-Scottish border tends to defy traditional fixed territorial lines and ways of defining them based on natural features or distinct historical separation between peoples. This particular boundary is the result of a more convoluted history with many shifts and changes, conflicts and subsequent agreements. New approaches to understanding borders highlight the importance of &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; borders at a variety of social and geographical scales, as well as the international ones that separate sovereign states. The Anglo-Scottish border is a hugely meaningful political-legal border in this context. The various contributions made to the series of seminars served to capture a dynamic period of change in the importance of the border. It may be that this internal border is re-acquiring some of the characteristics of an external border between sovereign states that has not existed here since 1707; bringing with it both new challenges and new opportunities. 

A special edition of the Journal of Borderlands Studies (to be published in 2017) will be edited by the Principal Investigator under the theme; 'Bringing the Anglo-Scottish border 'back in' and include a number of the contributions from the seminar series across a range of disciplines. The Journal will feature contributions from Professor Ysanne Holt (Northumbria University, Professor Iain Mclean (University of Oxford) and Professor Frank Peck (University of Cumbria) - all co-Is on ES/L001446/1. The different contributions capture both the dynamic nature of the Anglo-Scottish border and its competing (and contradictory) material and symbolic meanings.

3. The future development of research 

The September 2014 Independence referendum took place half way through the seminar series. This allowed for some reflection on the potential implications of the outcome for future research on collaboration across the Anglo-Scottish Border. A key finding was that the case for exploring new dynamics of cooperation between the North of England and Scotland is no less strong following the victory of the &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; campaign in the 2014 referendum than it would have been if Scotland had voted for independence. A direction of travel has been set which offers benefits and makes sense irrespective of that outcome. Greater Scottish autonomy has provided the spur for change but it is not a necessary condition. What emerges is a picture of the border that is less a line of separation, a barrier, and more a conjoining bridge between shared values, challenges and aspirations. In the final seminar in particular, three potential priorities for further research were identified:

? Incorporating into the devolution analyses a focus on the growing asymmetries that characterise English decentralisation.

? Producing greater evidence on the economic benefits of particular kinds of cross-border collaboration, with reference to relevant supply-chain connections, labour markets and sectoral priorities.

? Further research on the role of borders in terms of economics, but also in terms of social cohesion, sense of identity and belonging, (explored for example through literature, art and other cultural expressions).

The 'Leave' outcome of the 2016 referendum on EU membership in the UK - and the vote in favour of 'Remain' in Scotland - further complicates debates on the natue of the anglo-scottish border and may hasten a second independence referendum north of the border. There are opportunities to further develop research in this area (see below).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Academic Routes

The outcomes of the seminar series are being further developed within the academic community through a range of mechanisms. 

These include making connections between disciplines, for example, Keith Shaw (Social Science) and Ysanne Holt's (Art History) joint bid to the Leverhulme Trust entitled 'Further North'. 

New connections were also developed between research networks e.g. Keith Shaw being invited to contribute to the work of the ESRC Centre for Constitutional Change: http://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/about/people/keith-shaw. 

Links have also developed between the Principal investigator and the Centre for Border Studies in Ireland, including a written contribution to the Centre's journal and speaking at the Journal's launch in Dublin in November 2015. At present, a joint-bid ('Re-bordering the UK') is being developed that examines the experiences of devolution across UK borders. 

In September 2016, Shaw (with Professor Ignazio Cabras, Northumbria University; Professor Mike Danson, Heriot-Watt University; and Professor Frank Peck, University of Cumbria) secured funding from the ESRC for a 9-month research project, 'Enhancing policy-makers' understanding of the implications of Brexit for economic development and devolved governance in the north of England'. The aim of the project - which will consist of three workshop-style events, in Carlisle, Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne - will consider the implications of Brexit for: economic development in the North East and Cumbria (particularly focussing on rural development and sectors such as Agriculture, Renewable Energy and Tourism); the North East and Cumbria's relationship with Scotland (particularly if Brexit leads eventually to a 'hard' Anglo-Scottish border separating two countries with differing EU status); and future of devolution deals and the Northern Powerhouse.


2. Non-Academic routes

The key policy proposal that came from the seminar series, was to create a new approach to cross-border working though the creation of the Borderlands Initiative, a cross-border approach that brings together the five main local councils on either side of the Border. This proposal - which was supported by the Scottish Affairs Committee in their report, 'Our Borderlands, Our Future' in 2015 - is also in the process of being taken forward by a Borderlands Steering Group comprising the five local councils and representatives of the Scottish and UK Governments. 

Following the seminars, a funded collaborative project was undertaken between Northumbria University and the Centre for Regional Economic Development at the University of Cumbria which is concerned with the development of an economic strategy for the Anglo-Scottish Borderlands.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>63C1F247-093C-430C-9EA3-CF0B87638542</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c6f42db546d8.29260336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>115D9F16-04E1-4F93-A1B1-96024FEB6826</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;acirc;??Take us with you Scotland&amp;acirc;???
