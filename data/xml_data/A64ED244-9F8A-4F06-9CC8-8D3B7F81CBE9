It will provide carefully edited texts in original spelling, with full textual and interpretive apparatus. The volume is Vol. IV of the Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne (general editor Dr Peter McCullough), which plans to offer readers the first fully annotated critical edition of Donne's sermons. Although a significant achievement in its time, the current scholarly edition, The Sermons of John Donne, ed. by George Potter and Evelyn Simpson (1953-62) is by the standards of modern scholarship deficient. Potter and Simpson undertook only limited collation, provided minimal annotations, and a lack of historical understanding led to the misdating and incorrect assignment of place of preaching for a considerable number of sermons. In addressing these deficiencies the new edition will be a landmark publication in early modern studies. The volume will collate all available witnesses and provide carefully edited texts, privileging those texts which are closest to the sermon as delivered by Donne (as opposed to posthumously published texts). Each sermon will be presented with a full textual apparatus, evaluating the significance of any variants. The sermons will be framed with an introductory headnote and a commentary explicating meaning, identifying sources, and tracing literary and historical allusions. These annotations will render the sermons accessible to a full range of readers, including scholars, undergraduates, and the general reader. Donne's life-long and intimate relationship with the congregation at Lincoln's Inn (he had studied in the Society as a student and was personally connected to the Society by numerous friendships) render these sermons unique in the corpus of his preaching. By bringing them together (in Potter and Simpson's chronologically organised edition they were interspersed with sermons preached in quite different pulpits) and framing them with a scholarly introduction drawing attention to the specific character of the Lincoln's Inn pulpit, the volume will, for the first time, enable a reader to appreciate these sermons in the institutional and social contexts in which they were delivered.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The edited volume of sermons is intended not only to engage a wide and interdisciplinary range of scholars, but also to generate a readership for Donne's sermons among the general public. Donne's status as a widely read and appreciated poet is uncontested; he is regularly included in printed anthologies and BBC broadcasts, such as 'Poetry Please' and has an established place on School and examination curricula. In October 2009 he was ranked in second place in the BBC's 'Nation's Favourite Poet'. However, the lack of an annotated edition of the sermons has meant devotees of Donne's poetry have been unable to explore the canon of his sermons which, with their rhetorical showmanship, witty conceits, and intellectual and emotional intensity cannot fail to engage enthusiastic readers of the 'Songs and Sonnets'. The volumes in the Oxford Edition will remedy this, capitalising on Donne's popularity as a poet to create a new audience for his prose. In addition to the complete edition, Oxford University Press are committed to issuing a volume of selected sermons from across the edition aimed specifically at a general public readership. This volume (which will include material from my edited volume) will provide readers with an affordable and, with full annotations and headnotes, accessible introduction to Donne's sermons.

Not only will there be the clear benefit of enriching the cultural and intellectual lives of such readers, but the research will also play an important role in reconnecting the public with the national heritage of early modern preaching. The sermon was embedded in the cultural as well as the religious life of early modern England. However, in comparison with the awareness and appreciation of other sixteenth- and seventeenth-century genres (most notably drama and music), there is very little public understanding of the status and nature of preaching. The lack of accessible texts is undoubtedly a critical reason for this. Recent events such as the Globe Lecture Series 'The Heard Word: Pulpit vs Playhouse' (summer 2011) demonstrate, however, that there is a public appetite to explore early modern preaching and the ongoing and urgent public debates on the relationships between religion, society, and persuasive oratory mean there can hardly be a more opportune moment to capitalise on this interest. The edition will play a crucial role in this process by enabling the public to extend their knowledge through engaging with one of the most dynamic and original preachers in the English language.

The research will be of particular benefit to the Society of Lincoln's Inn. Developing mutually beneficial links and collaboration with the Society lies at the heart of the research for my volume. My work will necessitate a full and extensive engagement with the Society's archives (including the Society's records, the Black Books and, crucially, the Saunderson papers detailing the construction of the chapel during the period of Donne's employment) in order to document and illuminate key aspects of the Society's religious and cultural heritage. The research will also open up a series of dialogues with the Master and Benchers about the social and cultural role of the Society, the nature of its self-presentation, the importance of corporate and professional identity, and the legacy of Donne's involvement with the Inn, in both seventeenth- and twenty-first century contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56634</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Donne has long held an established place as one of the nation's favourite poets. I have sought to disseminate my research on his preaching in order to develop a new readership for the sermons. In so doing I have ensured that the research related knowledge I generated during the fellowship can have a societal impact, enhancing quality of life and contributing to cultural capital.
In March 2014 I collaborated with the preacher at Lincoln's Inn, Derek Watson, to arrange a service in commemoration of Donne held at Lincoln's Inn. I delivered an address as part of the service in which I talked about the ways in which my research has shed light on the nature of Donne's relationship with the Society and, in particular, the ways in which Donne sought to shape his preaching to the predominantly legal congregation at the Inn. The service also included readings from Donne's work and the choir performed musical settings of both his poetry and prose. Together with the Lincoln's Inn archivist, Guy Holborn, I put together an exhibition featuring some of the material connected with Donne owned by the Society, for example the Bible which he gave to the Benchers on his appointment as Dean of St Paul's. This event was advertised to members of the public in addition to members of the Society of Lincoln's Inn and was attended by approximately one hundred people. At the drinks reception afterwards the discussion raised a series of questions which suggested that research on Donne's relationship with Lincoln's Inn still has implications for the Society today. For example, benchers were keen to discuss the relationship between religious identity and the professional identity fostered by the Inn, and the possible parallels between oral delivery of a sermon and legal oratory in court.
In May 2014 I organised a second public engagement event in Sheffield. This event was devised in collaboration with Sheffield Cathedral and the Department of Music at the University of Sheffield and involved the performance of a Donne sermon as part of a seventeenth century Evening Prayer at Sheffield Cathedral. The sermon was Donne's sermon of Valediction, preached before he departed to Germany on the Doncaster Embassy in 1619, and the readings were selected to match, as nearly as possible, those which Donne's congregation would have heard nearly four hundred years earlier. A choir drawing on students from the Department of Music at the University of Sheffield and members of the Cathedral choir performed anthems by Byrd and Gibbons. The event was free and advertised widely to the general public and over one hundred people registered for tickets. A number of people travelled from other cities to attend and there were visitors from Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and York. A drinks reception after the event provided an opportunity for further discussion and questions. I have since received a number of requests to establish the event as an annual occasion at the cathedral suggesting it not only had an immediate societal impact, but has also created a new audience for Donne's sermons and enabled the wider public to explore the cultural heritage of early modern preaching.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8CE65E67-8BFF-4DB4-B108-69D582EBEBA1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461f58a0f7648.47804883</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research conducted during the fellowship has been dedicated to producing a critical edition of the sermons John Donne preached during the first half of his employment as preacher at Lincoln's Inn. This is being published as Vol IV of the Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne. I have completed full drafts of all the sermons ready for submission to the General Editor, Prof. Peter McCullough. My research has confirmed or refined the date of preaching for all these sermons and also generated a number of important new findings regarding the textual status of the sermons and Donne's processes of composition.
Of the fourteen sermons I have edited, five are extant in multiple print and manuscript witnesses. I have collated all these witnesses, some of which have never been collated before. In so doing I have developed a series of new methodologies for analysing variants in sermons which, as extended prose performance texts, differ from those genres which have traditionally been the focus on textual study in the early modern period. As a result I have, for the first time, determined the relationships between these print and manuscript witnesses and established critical texts for these five sermons. This work has shed light on the ways in which manuscripts copies of the sermons circulated and also refined our understanding of the extent to which Donne revised his work, which it appears varied far more sermon to sermon than has previously been appreciated.
All the sermons have been presented with a critical commentary explicating meaning, identifying sources and tracing literary and historical allusions. This sustained analysis has transformed our understanding of the sermons. For example, together with Peter McCullough's work on Donne's sermons at the Jacobean court, my examination of Donne's Biblical quotations has revealed how Donne's preference for the Geneva Bible was replaced with the Authorised Version in the late 1610s. I have also identified a number of new sources for the sermons. For example, I have established that in his sermons on Psalm 38 Donne drew extensively on Joannis Lorini (Jean de Lorin) Commentariorum in Librum Psalmorum (Lyons, 1611) and that a considerable portion of his sermon preached at Lincoln's Inn preparing them to build their new chapel draws on Ioannis Stephani Duranti (Durantus)'s De Ritibus Ecclesiae Catholicae (Lyons, 1606). Frequently these works function as 'mediating sources', taking Donne to a number of his patristic examples, as well as providing him with the raw material for his linguistic discussions of the original Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic. As such, these texts will allow us to re-think the extent of Donne's linguistic and patristic knowledge and to refine our understanding of the ways in which he navigated a range of sources. This work opens up important new questions about Donne's reading and the libraries he would have been using to access these books. His apparent preference for works of Continental scholarship, in particular Jesuitical scholarship, also prompts questions about how widely these texts were being used by Protestant preachers in the early seventeenth century and the extent to which Donne was unusual in his reading habits.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne will become the standard edition of Donne's sermons, replacing George Potter and Evelyn Simpson's 1653-62 edition. Donne scholars will draw on it for essential information on the textual status of the sermons and the sources of Donne's historical, linguistic, and theological allusions. They will use the research to explore important new lines of inquiry concerning, for example, Donne's reading, his linguistic knowledge, and his engagement with contemporary social, theological and political debates. Textual scholars will assimilate the research into their understanding of cultures of print and manuscript, and the full annotations will render the sermons an extremely valuable lens through which literary scholars, historians and theologians can read the period. Properly framed with an interpretative commentary it will now also be possible for these sermons to take a more prominent place on undergraduate and postgraduate teaching syllabi. I further envisage the research being of use to non-academic audiences keen to develop their knowledge of Donne beyond his poetry and to engage with our national religious heritage of early modern preaching. The research has and will continue to play a particularly important role at Lincoln's Inn, strengthening the Society's understanding of Donne's relationship to the Inn. My findings demonstrate the wealth of early modern material in the Inns of Court archives and will prompt further exploration of these resources by both members of the Inns and external scholars.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B94C658B-2EBB-4719-BF8A-A3660A684B6B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461fa33373f88.94502369</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08FFF79F-E96F-41FD-98CF-AFC0DC8EC436</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne, Volume 4, Sermons at the Inns of Court</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1bfe97a24335e2455559b71059759d39"><gtr:id>1bfe97a24335e2455559b71059759d39</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rhatigan, E.
