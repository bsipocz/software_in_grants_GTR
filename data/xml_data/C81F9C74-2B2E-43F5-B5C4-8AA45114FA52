Since India has one of the highest per capita uses of antibiotics it faces very significant challenges. It is also now known that antibiotic-resistant microbes found in the environment (e.g. water) contribute to the transfer of resistance and in recognition of this the World Health Organisation Global Action recognises the important role played by water. Of particular importance here is the way in which pollutants promote AMR. For example heavy metals in water correlates with AMR. Likewise the wide scale use of compounds such as triclosan (e.g. in soaps, shampoos, toothpaste) is leading to the development of AMR to a range of clinically important antibiotics. However this issue and link between pollutants and AMR is poorly understood. Thus we have a scenario where in India we have very high-levels of antibiotic use and AMR and high levels of pollutants that will exacerbate the problem.

This proposal brings together a team lead by Heriot Watt University and includes the world leading Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, the James Hutton Institute and the University of Edinburgh, building focused, proactive and long-term interdisciplinary partnerships.

This team will develop novel sensors to detect and monitor pollutants focussing on studying AMR co-selectors to improve the understanding of how these pollutants mediated and impact AMR with five integrated work-packages that will

WP1: Identify novel polymers for pollutant pre-concentration (potentially removal at source) and integration into sensors.

WP2: Develop novel sensors to detect and monitor heavy metals, antimicrobials and AMR genes.

WP3: Create low-cost paper-based sensors for pollutants.

WP4: Create easy-to-use, robust, low-cost integrated detection systems.

WP5: Undertake case studies to identify the main AMR genes and levels of pollutant at test sites in India and the UK, and validate the performance of detection methods.

As part of our impact and engagement activities we will provide end-users with information and solutions that will help tackle the significant AMR problem that is linked to India's water quality issues. By leveraging the breadth of our international leading science and engineering excellence across the entire team the team will implement and deploy affordable and practical technologies with the capabilities required by researchers in the field helping to promote sustainable economic growth and welfare within India.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary purpose of this project, and basis for impact and engagement, is to provide a better understanding of the prevalence of different pollutants in water and their impact on AMR, developing new sensor technology to support this monitoring, and to thereby inform the development of management strategies and technologies to reduce pollution levels. This problem exists globally but is particularly critical in India. To achieve long-standing impact, the following measures will be carried out:

- Building and maintain focused, proactive and long-term interdisciplinary partnerships. 
- Leveraging the breadth of our international leading science and engineering excellence across the entire team to implement and deploy affordable and practical technologies with the capabilities required by researchers and end users in the field. 
- Promoting knowledge transfer, innovation and a culture of indigenous entrepreneurship, while 
- Promoting the economic development and welfare of our international partners such that the project outcomes are exploited locally. 

The project will impact on a range of stakeholders beyond the academic sphere including the water utility companies, the water regulators, Government policy makers, public health bodies, the commercial private sector of the water industry, sensor and microfluidic manufacturing companies and the general public. We are committed to engaging with all stakeholder groups to maximise the impact of the research outputs from this project with the key objective of developing long-term, sustainable partnerships that promote societal welfare and economic growth in India and will do this through the following activities:
- Outreach Programmes from School Pupils to Universities: The team will design low-cost, fun and engaging activities, explaining the project, to run with school children at science festivals in Scotland, e.g. Bang goes the Borders, Dunbar and Midlothian Science Festivals and European Researchers Night. These resources will be shared with India for use in local schools, educating the local community on the risks of AMR and the role of water/wastewater.
- Media and Public Activities including a Public-focused Website
- Focused Workshops: The plan allows for Workshops both in the UK and in India and these will be funded to allow local industries and policy makers to be invited and to be appraised of the outcomes and successes of the work, with a view to encouraging engagement and (commercial) uptake of the outcomes of the research. Additionally, a workshop with the Sensors for Water Interest Group will be organised in the UK.
- Involvement of policy makers: The data will directly support decision-making by local government agencies, who will be included in the project through invitation to the regular project meetings and dissemination workshops. This will help both India and the UK achieve the Clean Water &amp;amp; Sanitation Global Goal targets of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water. Policy briefs (individual for UK and India) will be written using the new data generated within this project at the end of year 3 for policymakers in water and public health sectors and environment. These briefs will be written in collaboration with colleagues from the Water Research Centre (Robert Pitchers) in the UK and Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board in India.
- Commercial Exploitation: The entire team have a very strong record associated with the exploitation and application of their research outputs and entrepreneurship. Clearly the technology, knowledge and systems developed in this project are of commercial interest and could potentially result in new products and services. One set of potential customers are the water utilities as well as with private commercial companies acting within the water sector, who will be approached via existing contacts and through the Heriot-Watt Commercialisation Team</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>456831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R003270/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8717CFA9-D46B-41A5-8971-BF4431B68E29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1E31C833-3A35-4F54-A499-31D0C245B5D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>System on Chip</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98C0D11F-5C27-40CE-A895-54E4C61784B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technol. for Environ.
