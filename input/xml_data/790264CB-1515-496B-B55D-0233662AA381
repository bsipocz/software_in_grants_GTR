They are bilingual in Latin and Greek, and it is often stated that they were originally designed to teach Latin to Greek speakers, though we find them largely in medieval manuscripts (from the ninth to the sixteenth centuries) whose copyists intended to use them to teach Greek to Latin speakers. The most interesting portions of these Hermeneumata are the colloquia, a series of dialogues, narratives of the events in a typical day, and useful phrases for situations such as inviting friends to lunch, going to court, borrowing money, taking a trip to the baths, bargaining over the price of clothes, rebuking idle slaves, or having a brawl. These colloquia offer a rare glimpse into the ordinary lives of Romans, and particularly of Roman children, for they provide a large percentage of our information on what went on in ancient schools: not only the type of academic work done, but the different grades of teachers, the division of the students, their seating arrangements, the squabbles between them, etc. The colloquia have an intrinsic appeal to a wide audience: historians are interested in the detail they provide on daily life, linguists in the light they shed on conversational Greek and Latin, and educational theorists in their strikingly modern approach to language teaching. But the extent to which they can be used for such purposes has hitherto been limited by the inaccessible fashion in which they have been published. They have never been translated, and most of them have never even received a proper critical edition; that is, scholars have to rely on transcripts of individual manuscripts, often not the best available manuscripts, rather than having a modern text created by examining all the manuscripts and working out the best readings. Moreover, there has never been a comprehensive study of the origins and development of the colloquia, so disagreement is rife on subjects like when, where, and by whom they were written.\n My project is to produce a critical edition, translation, and study of these colloquia. The main result will be a scholarly work in two volumes, with the definitive Greek and Latin text, translation, and technical discussion. Additionally I intend to publish several articles for a more general audience, to make this interesting material more widely available. I am also working on incorporating some of the results into a new elementary Latin textbook, so that this ancient Latin teaching material can once again be used as it was designed to be used, by elementary students.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Though the primary beneficiaries of this research will be other scholars, there are three ways in which it could have impact outside academia. \n As the material in the colloquia is intrinsically interesting, there are many people who would derive the benefit of enjoyment and satisfaction of curiosity from reading about it. I intend to publish several articles aimed at a popular audience to offer people this benefit.\n The colloquia also have genuine usefulness as Latin-teaching materials; the reason they were successful in antiquity is that they provide lively, interesting texts written in relatively easy Latin, and the same characteristics would make for success in today's classrooms. I am working on an elementary Latin textbook that incorporates excerpts from the colloquia, embedded in a framework more suitable for the modern student than that in which they are found in the Hermeneumata. If this textbook is successful it could be widely used in schools as well as universities; it would thus have considerable impact on people other than scholars.\n The work is likely to have some indirect impact arising from its use by other scholars. Such impact is difficult to predict in nature (see impact plan for some guesses) and largely beyond my control: editions and translations of ancient texts are tools, and all the creator can do to ensure that they will be used is to make them as usable as possible. To this end I shall make every effort to produce a work that will be usable by the diverse group of academic beneficiaries predicted. Usability in such circumstances consists largely of correct information clearly presented, so I shall take pains to make sure the information is correct and to make the presentation accessible to scholars from all the fields that I think are relevant to this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22276</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I000429/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0CBBED5C-44FC-4F3D-9A21-8E5A3B7AC8F1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
