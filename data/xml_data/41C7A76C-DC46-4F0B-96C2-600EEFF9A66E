There is likely to be a read-across to other PaCCS themes (Conflict and Cybersecurity), and there is the potential to engage the interest of a broad range of non-academic stakeholders (at home and abroad).

I will frame the work of the Research Integrator within this context. I can provide a realistic and disciplined approach to the role. But I won't stifle innovative and creative of projects likely to have been chosen for their willingness to take risks. Given limited time available to perform the role, it is also essential that nothing is done to duplicate the plans and networks established by the projects themselves. This has been a key principle of my time as PaCCS Champion, which would continue to apply here.

There are a number of phases to my proposed approach (although I see the programme of work developing organically and flexibly, with opportunities to accelerate or integrate different phases, in response to the needs of the projects themselves). 

Phase 1: Familiarisation. I hold one-to-one discussions with PIs and partners in all projects. I convene an early networking workshop where the PIs get to know one another: we compare and contrast research proposals, identify common themes, and understand the needs of non-academic stakeholders.

Phase 2: Network Infrastructure. I liaise with the PaCCS Communications Coordinator, looking for an opportunity to establish the database of projects on the TNOC page(s) of the PaCCS website and exploring opportunities for introducing TNOC-specific blogs from projects, a collaborative workspace, etc.

Phase 3. Early Collaboration. I work with PIs to enhance impact and knowledge exchange, offering clinics to develop tailored plans, making recommendations to extend links to non-academic stakeholders (in Government, Industry and the Third Sector); I will hold parallel discussions with potential beneficiaries of research in order to finesse opportunities for impact. I will draw on any related academic work, for instance work to map the different research projects and produce a &amp;quot;synthesis piece&amp;quot;. A workshop at the end of Year 1 would bring the projects together, ideally with their nominated non-academic stakeholders.

Phase 4. Generating Early Impact &amp;amp; Knowledge Exchange. Further clinics are run, looking for synergies between projects (facilitating the sharing of data, networks and findings). I design and deliver speed-dating and/or placement schemes; and organise a Policy Workshop where researchers join with stakeholders to promote impact and knowledge exchange. 

Phase 5. Dissemination of Outputs. I draw on findings and recommendations from our Policy Workshop to draft, design, publish and launch one or more Policy Briefings (with a focus on synergies), pursuing follow-up action to increase likelihood of impact. This is done in collaboration with PIs and their partners. I also support individual projects to maximise their outreach, helping draft messages to relevant audiences.

I will work with the communications infrastructure that I developed as PaCCS Champion: the Communications Coordinator, the website , and the Twitter handle (with almost 800 followers). Another important resource is the website being established by RUSI and funded by ESRC to support the Strategic Hub on Organised Crime. Channels for communication include broadcasting on social media (Twitter) and websites (publishing news stories, blogs and success stories); I have also worked with media outlets, including The Conversation UK which delivers product into the Creative Commons and is read around the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A particularly important outcome from this call could be the emergence of enhanced capacity to conduct larger, longer and more complex research projects; the Research Integrator can make a significant difference here.

I would also expect &amp;quot;Intellectual Impact&amp;quot; to be delivered by this grant, where the judgments of policy- and decision-makers are illuminated by insights from research. I have identified a number of mechanisms that have proved to be a cost-effective way of exchanging knowledge and enhancing impact. Given budgetary constraints, these will be tailored to the TNOC role, and I will fine-tune the options in consultation with the Principal Pnvestigators (PIs) themselves; but they include the following:

Networking/Teaming Events: I bring together the PIs, RAs and (where appropriate) non-academic stakeholders involved in the ten projects; options would include a 2-day residential team-building event, and the employment of innovative techniques like a writing slam to generate synergies and outputs.

Impact Clinics: I aim to offer one-to-one sessions with PIs, to identify action to enhance impact; these are important not only for uncovering opportunities to synthesise research activities and outcomes associated with the TNOC projects, but also to help individual projects reach maximum potential through helping shape messages and identify suitable target audiences for their work.

Speed-Dating: inspired by the &amp;quot;Fellowship Schemes&amp;quot; that I have run, this has up to four individuals from different stakeholder communities meeting researchers to explore questions identified by stakeholders; this is an effective way to break down barriers, exchange knowledge and build trust between policy-makers and researchers, with some longer-term relationships emerging from the encounters.

Placement Schemes: I plan to fund one placement, where an RA or doctoral student from a project spends a month with their non-academic partner in order to answer a strategic question and exchange knowledge; this should lead to an output of value to both the stakeholder and the researchers, which would hopefully be published; my budget can cover one such placement (probably to be selected through a competition between the 10 projects); but we might be able to find ways for a larger number to be funded.

Policy Workshop: this will take place near the end of the programme, when researchers can present their findings to a gathering of policy-makers and practitioners, with non-academic engagement from different sectors (eg Government, Industry, Civil Society); this is not a one-way street: stakeholders are invited to respond to what they hear, with the aim of extracting insights from the fusion of academic and non-academic minds.

Policy Paper(s): in consultation with PIs and others, I will turn the findings from the Workshop into one or more Policy Papers which are launched and disseminated, with a media strategy if appropriate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71032</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P00301X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
