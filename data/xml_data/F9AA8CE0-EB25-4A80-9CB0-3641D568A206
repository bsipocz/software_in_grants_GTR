enzyme</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/K002627/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project is aimed at understanding how Photosystem 2 (PS2) works. This enzyme is found in plants, algae and some microbes. It is the main solar converter of photosynthesis, the process by which solar energy is converted to the chemical fuels used for powering life . Nearly all life on the planet runs on energy that came from photosynthesis. 

PS2 is important not just as a solar collector; it is the only enzyme that has is able to use water to make fuel. Water (H2O) is very stable; it takes a lot of energy to rip it apart, two molecules at a time, to provide electrons for fuel making. PS2 is able to do this using solar energy. This reaction releases protons (4H+) and oxygen gas (O2) as side-products.

PS2 evolved in bacteria on the primitive Earth when O2 was absent. This was a key event in the evolution of life. The O2 released could be used for respiration, a much more efficient way of using biological fuels than existed previously. This drastic jump in the efficiency of energy use meant that biology could become much more complicated: multicellular life could develop. The O2 escaped to the atmosphere and was converted to ozone by UV radiation. The ozone formed then blocked further deadly UV from reaching the surface of the planet. Overall, PS2 provided the energy for life to flourish, allowed life to come out from under the stones and to develop into life as we know it. It is the enzyme that changed the planet.

This project is focused on how PS2 works and how the part that reacts with water is built into the part that does the solar conversion. This building-in process is called &amp;quot;photoactivation&amp;quot; and it occurs when the enzyme is first made and when it is repaired. Given that every plant and nearly every photosynthetic microbe has many millions of these enzymes and that each PS2 needs to be repaired about every 30 minutes, then there is rather a lot of photoactivation going on. And yet very little is known about it. It is known that during photoactivation PS2 is particularly sensitive to being damaged by light. Under stress conditions (too hot, too cold, too dry, etc), this can end up killing the cell and this can limit the yields of crops and determine whether the organism lives or dies. We wish to understand what is going on here. The work is likely to be useful to farmers, the agri-science industry, ecologists etc because it should allow methods and processes to be developed for improving yields of crops and improving survival of photosynthetic species in a changing environment. 

The fossil fuels represent the product of eons of photosynthesis converting solar energy to biomass by the capture CO2 from the ancient atmosphere. Humans are in the process of returning the CO2 to the atmosphere in what is &amp;quot;the blink of an eye&amp;quot; on a planetary time-scale and this is changing the planet. Perhaps the biggest challenge to scientists at present is to solve the energy/climate crisis by finding alternatives to fossil fuels. It is becoming clear that solar energy is the only alternative energy source that is big enough to do this. While converting solar energy to electricity is straightforward, to solve our energy needs, particularly for transport, we require fuels. Solar fuel production is a crucial requirement. Natural photosynthesis is the biggest solar fuel producer however it does this slowly and inefficiently and we cannot rely on natural photosynthesis to replace fossil fuels that took eons to accumulate. Artificial solar fuel production aims to &amp;quot;cherry-pick&amp;quot; the best features from natural photosynthesis to make a more efficient artificial version. The water splitting enzyme, the enzyme that changed the planet, is the main focus of scrutiny for these studies. The current research will provide key information on how this enzyme works, how it is made and how it is repaired: information that is key for solar fuel production by artificial photosynthesis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Objective 1. Photoactivation of PSII in the thermophilic cyanobacterial PSII: establishing the optimal physical, chemical and biochemical conditions. The flash-pairs method of Chenaie will be used with bacterial cells and isolated enzyme to obtain the two key kinetic parameters for the initial steps of photoactivation. We shall also determine the temperature and O2 dependencies of these processes. We shall test the influence of extrinsic polypeptides on photoactivation. 

Objective 2. Generation and characterisation of mononuclear Mn intermediates in PSII photoactivation in T. elongatus: the first steps. The first Mn3+ state will be generated by flash and cw illumination under a range of conditions. Various components (Mn2+, Mn3+, Mn4+, TyrZ, TyrD and the electron acceptors) will be monitored by different types of EPR, kinetic UV/visible and fluorescence spectroscopies before and after the &amp;quot;B to C step&amp;quot;. 

Objective 3. Generation of multinuclear Mn intermediates in photoassembly: the hunt for S-4, S-2 etc. We shall use EPR to search for multinuclear Mn complexes formed as intermediates during photoactivation. We will focus on Mn3+Mn2+ dimer states including the S-2 state. Understanding these states could allow us to distinguish between the high valence and low valence models for the functional Mn. The effect of Ca2+ binding will be studied before and after formation of the high valence intermediates.

Objective 4 Structural characterisation of intermediates in photoactivation. When intermediates are generated that are sufficiently stable, PSII shall be the subject of crystallisation trials. The Mn-depleted enzyme, monomeric and dimeric forms, will be studied with and without assembly proteins, e.g. Psb27, PsbP and PsbQ. Mn-free PSII is a target as a basis for understanding the changes occurring during photoactivation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will elucidate the process of photoactivation: the assembly of the water oxidising enzyme, Photosystem II (PSII). This occurs when the enzyme is made and when it is repaired. PSII is the main solar energy converter on Earth: it puts the energy into biosphere. It is made in vast quantities and each one is repaired every 30 minutes. Photoactivation limits plant growth and survival of the organism under some stress conditions. Understanding this process is thus important for agriculture for the production of food, fibre and fuel. The enzyme itself is the fastest of any water oxidation catalyst made from cheap, Earth-abundant materials and it thus represents the bench-mark model for catalyst design for solar fuel production in artificial photosynthesis. This is considered to be one of the very few scalable, sustainable technologies that will replace fossil fuels. The enzyme is responsible for putting the O2 into the atmosphere, thereby changing the nature of life and the planet itself. The events in photoactivation probably reflect the evolution of the enzyme, with early steps in the assembly of metal cluster representing evolutionary stages in the enzyme's development. Overall then the project is of intrinsic interest and benefit to a very wide public. 

In the energy sector, beneficiaries include: companies wishing to develop alternatives to fossil fuels and those who wish to move into green chemistry; governments and policy makers who wish for energy security and for new energy sources for developing countries; the armed forces who are looking for alternative fuels for specific and niche uses; environmentalists who need to focus on rational long-term alternatives to fossil fuels; and the general public who will soon have to accept that a change to a sustainable energy regime is inevitable. The benefits derived from the development of artificial photosynthesis as an alternative technology are evident and cannot be overestimated. They will contribute to mitigating the impending climate/energy crisis: the biggest problem facing mankind. If this problem is not solved, then all other problems of health, economy, etc will soon be dwarfed by it. 
Bioenergies will also contribute to the sustainable energy sector, although this is likely to be on a much smaller scale and mainly for niche uses. Bioenergies are mainly based on photosynthesis either directly or indirectly, so PSII research is central to them. The present project will be of benefit to bioenergy companies, farmers, policy makers, governments and the armed forces. 

In the agricultural sector, beneficiaries include: companies involved in developing new species, strains or processes for maintaining and or improving crop yields under stress conditions of changing environments; farmers who wish to develop new practices for similar reasons; governments and policy-makers interested achieving food security; and the public who will benefit from food security.

In the environmental and ecological sector, beneficiaries include: those wishing to understand and mitigate loss of photosynthetic species in a changing environment. These include professionals in the sector, governments and policy makers, the tourism sector (coral reef bleaching) and fisheries (the loss of photosynthetic microbes at the start of the food chain). 
In the education sector, in museums and in the media etc, there will be benefits from the intrinsic interest in one of the few definable milestones in the origins and evolution of life: the ability to oxidise water resulting in the appearance of O2 in the environment. 

Staff hired for the project will obtain training in cutting-edge research in a leading lab in this important area. They will have the benefit of the excellent intellectual environment of a leading university with the tradition of close ties with engineers and applications. It is likely that they will go on to contribute to this subject in UK industry or academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>367556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Saclay Nuclear Research Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>kreiger ROS studies Saclay</gtr:description><gtr:id>74D6C895-56D3-47AC-9F9A-E8050EB84481</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Published article in Proc Nat Acad Sci USA in October 2016.

Some of the EPR phenomena were my own discoveries from my work in the 1980's.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique</gtr:department><gtr:description>Fabrice Rappaport Paris</gtr:description><gtr:id>8EC2EA65-BFD9-4E79-A898-F005E9782E4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two papers were published from this collaboration another is being written and there are several findings that require further experimental study.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e08f8f985541.97353881-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Fabrice Rappaport and his colleagues have worked in close collaboration with us to address biological problems and samples that we have brought to them.

This process turns out to be the Achilles heal of the enzyme, since light is required in order to oxidise the metal ions and yet the enyme is not yet functional and so charge recombination is the dominant outcome of excitation. Complex redox tuning occurs to minimise photodamage but these processes are not understood. Photodamage of the enzyme is considered to be responsible for limitations in photosynthesis yields and thus crop yields under certain conditions. Understanding how this process works could allow improved yields. 
Our studies of the yields of photosynthesis have important impacts on understanding the limitations of photosynthesis. We have provided advice to government bodies, policy makers and industry linked expert groups on the efficiency of photosynthesis and its impact on policy with regards to biofuel production. This kind of information is crucial to if policy is to be informed by science and thus avoid policies that are misinformed and lead to undesirable outcomes. 
The discovery of a new regulatory mechanism in photosynthesis, could have a major influence on the field and will provide the basis of future grant requests aimed at characterising this process to see how it influences photosynthetic yield with connotations for food security and energy issues. 
Our work on evolution of photosynthesis was used in the US media to produce a rap song.

1) Photoactivation in cells and PSII cores
 We set up a system to reproduce the work done on the Synechocystis 6803 as described in the literature. Photoactivation was observed although to a lesser extent compared to the literature. Attempts to do the same experiment with the thermophilic strains failed. One problem encountered was the presence of chemicals generated by the cyanobacterium in the culture medium that reacted strongly with the redox chemicals required for the experiment. Attempts were made to treat the cells to remove the excreted reductants but the thermophilic cells did not behave well in photoactivation experiments. Efforts were made to study photoactivation in isolated PSII. These showed the low levels of photoactivation but were found to be reliant on the presence of the components know to be necessary in media: Cl- Ca2+, Mn2+, an electron acceptor and bicarbonate. Given the low yields spectroscopy was not attempted. The role of bicarbonate became the focus of our attention (see below).

2) Electron transfer through the quinones, charge recombination and redox tuning in Photosystem II

a) We have investigated aspects photodamage in Photosystem II that occurs before during and after assembly of the cluster. The protein is particularly susceptible during assembly of the enzyme since the lack of electron donation results in enhanced charge recombination. In recent studies we showed how redox tuning greatly influences the outcome of charge recombination. We also showed that the standard model for relating thermodynamics to distance and kinetics can be applied to predict outcomes (Sugiura et al 2014). 

b) We have also studied forward electron transfer between the electron acceptors, QA and QB, in T. elongatus attempting to obtain definitive values for the thermophilic reaction centre for which the crystal structure exists. This was done as part of a collaboration with Fabrice Rappaport in Paris and has been continued using the instrument at Imperial, which is based on the set-up in Paris. The aim was to compare the rates of electron transfer before and after assembly of the MnCa cluster with the aim of using the predicted changes in kinetics as a assay for the conformational step that results in the ~130mV down-shift in Em of QA/QA- upon photoactivation, which we discovered previously (see below). These studies are still in progress however they have already provided results that are relevant to recent studies in the literature on turnover of the steps (S states) in the water splitting enzyme and they are key in determining the validity of recent high profile, time-resolved crystallographic studies using free electron laser methodology. At a meeting in the US in 2014, we questioned a recent publication in Nature and at the following meeting in 2015 we presented our data relevant to this problem. To resolve the problem we joined forces with the crystallography group in question, Petra Fromme's team in Arizona. We made kinetic measurements on crystals and we hope to complete the study in the near future. 
c) We have used QA- to QB/QB- electron transfer kinetics to characterise and monitor the effect of bicarbonate binding to PSII. Bicarbonate binding has been linked to photoactivation for decades. We hope to clarify its role. As a first step we have shown the bicarbonate binding affects the redox potential of QA in PSII before and after photoactivation. The effect appears to be greater in the absence of the Mn, this could indicate a link between bicarbonate binding on the non-heme iron and the binding of the Ca/Mn cluster. This needs to be followed up as it is of potential importance as an example of &amp;quot;across-the-protein&amp;quot; information transmission and could be significant in photoactivation. Some of this work has been presented in a bioenergetics workshop in Dec 2015 in London, and will be presented in a Photosynthesis workshop in March 2016 and a bioenergetics Harden Conference in April 2016. A paper is about to be submitted on this (Brinkert et al ).

3) Photocurrents from PSII on electrode surfaces
The original idea was as follows: since charge recombination is a potential limiting factor for photoactivation, an electrochemical method that definitively removes the electron from the system would improve the efficiency of photoactivation, potentially opening up the option of higher quantum yield production of intermediates.

a) We immobilised Photosystem II onto a nanostructured TiO2 on ITO (Brinkert et al 2016 BBA in press). We did the first detailed mechanistic studies of this system in an attempt to understand the rate limiting step in the biohybrid system. Using monolayers of PSII on TiO2 we found surprisingly that the rate-limiting step for electron transfer was in fact in the TiO2 rather than through PSII or between PSII and the material. This explained several anomalies that had remained unexplained in earlier studies. We concluded, that this behaviour limits the use of this approach for studying the enzyme and defines better what properties are required from the material for future studies (Brinkert et al 2016 BBA). The results showed that it seems unlikely that this approach will be useful for photoassembly studies until a different electrode material can be found which has better kinetic characteristics. 

b) Using meso-structured ITO on ITO (Kato et al 2013) photocurrents were demonstrated in collaboration with Erwin Reisner's group in Cambridge. In principle this material should not have the same problems as TiO2. Methods were developed for oriented immobilisation (Kato et al 2013)resulting in increased photocurrents (studies done in collaboration with the group of E. Reisner Cambridge University). Some of the behaviour on meso ITO implies that it could have the same limitations as we characterised with TiO2. Nevertheless structurally modified version of this material were used to connect a PSII to a O2 tolerant hydrogenase electrode to produce linked up water splitting hydrogen producing biohybrid cell (Merch et al 2015). 

4) Spectroelectrochemical titrations of the quinone electron acceptors 
We know from our previous work that a significant change in the redox potential of QA occurs during one of the steps of photoassembly. The exact values were disputed and our first aim was to resolve the discrepancy in the literature. We have thus developed thin layer spectroelelctrochemical titration methods in our lab. This required a good deal of experimentation with a range cell designs and with other technical procedures that turned out to be necessary to obtain reliable results. After painstaking experimentation and some serendipity we discovered the origin of the long standing discrepancy: bicarbonate, which ligands the non-heme iron, can be lost during redox titrations. Unexpectedly this has a major influence on the redox potential of QA. This work not only resolved the long running problem, thereby fixing the reference thermodynamic value in PSII bioenergetics, but it also showed the existence of a new kind of regulation of photosynthesis: CO2 (the terminal acceptor) regulates the function of PSII in terms of the forward electron transfer and in terms of redox tuning to prevent photodamge of the PSII when electron transfer is inhibited. 
These findings resolve the mystery of the bicarbonate effect in photosynthesis which has remained unsolved for 58 years. At the same time a whole area of regulation has been discovered that should provide new insights for understanding regulation, protection and efficiency of photosynthesis (Brinkert et al in preparation). This opens exciting new avenues of research in photosynthesis relevant to photosynthetic efficiency and thus to bioenergy and food security. 
These unexpected findings are also relevant to the proposed role for bicarbonate in photoactivation. It seems possible that the reported role on photoactivation could be due to bicarbonate binding on the acceptor side leading to enhanced photoactivation due to enhanced electron transfer out of PSII and thus less charge recombination. We hope to test this possibility soon.
We are also attempting to determine if other components change their redox potentials during photo assembly. Some of these studies have been done in Marseille collaborating with Dr Wolfgang Nitschke (CNRS).

5 Phylogenetic studies
In depth phylogenetic studies have been performed on the D1 protein of the PSII reaction centre. Interesting new insights were obtained which related to the evolutionary history of water splitting with interesting repercussions on the evolution of the photoassembly process (Cardona et al 2015). The idea that the steps in photoactivation represent steps in the evolutionary development of the enzyme was developed and confronted with phylogenetic approaches and useful insights were obtained (Cardona 2016). We have taken an interest in variant forms of PSII which contain unusual D1 proteins and we have begun studies aimed at studying these unusual reaction centres. It has been suggested that they represent ancestral forms of PSII, which were unable to assemble the full Mn4CaO5 cluster that allows efficient water oxidation. We hope to pursue studies on these variant forms of PSII in the future.

6) Studies of the Mn site deprotonation chemistry

a) Through computational chemistry done in collaboration with Hiro Ishikita at the University of Tokyo, we put forward a model for deprotonation of the lowest redox potential step of the water splitting cycle. This involved deprotonation of a hydroxo group at O4 position in the cluster. It was shown that this was a more likely candidate for deprotonation than the alternative O5 position since the the O4 is the only oxygen atom in the cluster with an H-bond. Furthermore, the H-bond connects directly to a chain of H2O molecules that represent probably the best example of a Grotthus chain yet reported. The calculations showed that protons are despatched into the aqueous medium down this water chain upon oxidation of the Mn cluster from S0 to S1. We argued that the mechanism and energetics of this step reflect the need to prevent over-reduction of the cluster thus preventing spontaneous loss of the Mn and avoiding the need for photoassembly after a short period in the dark. This article was published in Nature Communications (Saito et al 2015).

b) Using spectroscopy, in collaboration with Alain Boussac at Saclay we studied the transitions through the S1 to S2 to S3 steps, following up many years of research but with the benfit of the high resolution crystal structure. Using a trick developed in Saclay by Alain Boussac, the enzyme was studied with Sr present instead of Ca. This resulted in unusual behaviour which we attribute to modified energetics for the crucial deprotonation step that occurs in the normal enzyme upon formation of the S3 state. The results are one of the few experimental results relevant to one of the main questions being discussed at present: what is the nature of S3, how is it formed and how does it react? see (Boussac et al 2015 BBA). 


c) The debate alluded to above on S3 structure and function is occurring mainly through computational chemistry. It has been difficult to enter this area however in collaboration with Ville Kaila at the Technical University of Munich, we have made a significant contribution producing a model of S3 formation involving the key deprotonation step, the entry of a substrate water into the cluster followed by deprotonation, the formation of the O-O bond, O2 release, and reloading of the sites, with the associated structural changes and the eventual formation of the most reduced state, S0. A flurry of paper came out on S3 formation in 2015 but our contribution has insights that make it attractive and original (Ugur et al 2016).

These 3 articles all deal with all 4 deprotonation steps in the enzyme cycle as well as the structural changes occurring in the cluster. The insight obtained feed into our picture of enzyme function, the protonation mechanisms and water binding steps occurring in the enzyme. These are relevant to what is expected during the course of photoactivation. We are thus better positioned to address these questions during photoassembly. We thus feel it was useful to put effort into approaches that allowed the application of the spectroscopic and computational chemistry methods, as they are at the forefront of the field. These insights and approaches will be extended into our continuing efforts on research photoassembly.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) The photo assembly process consitiutes the phase in the life cycle of the water oxidising enzyme in which it is most susceptible to photodamage. Understanding these processes could lead to more efficient production of food or products from plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria. Our specific findings on bicarbonate, the redox potential of QA, electron transfer rates, leaks to O2 etc should be useful for researchers working on photactivation. 
2) Our new findings on the role of bicarbonate opens up a whole new field of study: a new and fundamental type of sink to source feedback mechanism that controls not only electron transfer rates but the susceptibility of PSII to photodamage. This will be of interest to photosynthesis researchers on both sides of the light/dark divide, as it links both sides together. This breakthrough could have a major impact on future efforts to develop high yield more systainable crops for food, chemicals, materials and potentially energy. Our discoveries (published in PNAS in Oct 2016) were the subject news article was written by other researchers in in the field and published in Trends of Plant Science. Several other groups have begun reinterpreting findings in the light of the new regulation mechanism. 
3) Our findings on deprotonation and water splitting mechanism are at the heart of one of the biggest questions in biology: and they should feed into the current drive to develop biologically inspired catalyst for artificial solar fuel production. There is huge interest in this domain and some of our findings are at the forefront of the field. 
4) Our findings on photocurrents should drive a move to different materials that fit better the requirements we have defined. This represents a clear influence but on a small commumity.
5) Our findings on the evolution of photosynthesis captures the imagination of the public and other researchers, since it involves the processes that changed the face of the planet.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B1952456-F68A-4000-BCA1-1F76DCA02A41</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a0835942353.72666546</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and
