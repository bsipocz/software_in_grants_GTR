Through this project we will engage a more diverse audience with astronomy (given the City of Westminster unique population) and will make the subject of astronomy available and accessible to communities that are disadvantaged and under-represented; remove the barrier of social inequality by providing free events in their local library.

We also aim to encourage partnership between secondary schools, colleges and Westminster Reference Library and make the subject of astronomy come alive in a fun, practical and accessible way through our sky viewing sessions for young people (aged 15-18).

We believe the idea of loaning telescopes goes to the heart of what libraries should be about in the 21st century, providing free access to knowledge and widening horizons, in a safe, trusted, environment.

This project will give an opportunity for the library to re-emphasise its original purpose which is to give the whole community access to resources which they could not afford to buy individually. 

The library is keen to support science literacy and to give astronomy a higher profile, as this forms part of its unique Newtonian heritage. 
(Sir Isaac Newton lived on the site of the library - 35 St. Martin's Street, London, WC2H 7HP - between 1710 and 1727 and constructed an observatory on the roof.)</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>* The results of evaluation will be quantified, documented and communicated to external and internal stakeholders, and the information gathered will be used to produce a programme report.

* Programme media (photography, audio, film) will be available on Westminster/Tri-Borough Libraries social media (Twitter, Facebook, Eventbrite,LinkdIn, Youtube) and websites.

* Press cuttings and online links featuring photos and stories about the programme will be collated.

* Evaluation will be shared through presentations to stakeholders, media, and online social media, online directory and resource guides for local authorities and national library network.

* Online forums - participants and staff will be invited to share opinions about the programme through online discussion groups and blogs on 'Books &amp;amp; the City' webpage. The Online Services coordinator (Ali Holder - Tri-Borough Libraries) will gather and analyse comments shared online for use in evaluation summaries.

* VOX-POPS during events/sky watching sessions staff will interview participants about their experiences using handheld audio-visual recording device to gather feedback.

* There will be a dedicated webpage on the WCC Libraries website about the programme created by Tri-Borough Website Team.
 
* We intend to share the results of our project with other libraries across the UK through the forum of CILIP (chartered institute of library and information professionals) and provide support in the form of advice and information to any other libraries who wish to replicate this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3243</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P001629/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
