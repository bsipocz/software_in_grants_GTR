This was adopted by the department and was used when evaluating new potential projects.

The insights into how to design virtual spaces to support creativity became part of Gauntlett's 'platforms for creativity' principles, which have been adopted by some designers and also fed into work with the LEGO Group.

Some of the key findings, sunmmarised here very briefly, were:

* Although Adventure Rock was not as sophisticated as many commercial services, it was enjoyed by the children in the study. They appreciated the 'outdoor' environment and the 3D graphics, and they liked that it was free.

* The service offered some (rather ordinary and non-distinctive) educational benefits, and encouraged computer literacy.

* Children in the study were disappointed by the lack of social, collaboration or chat features within the game, and older children in particular felt that it was odd that although many other players must be downloading the game and therefore were 'on' the island, they could not see or encounter any of them.
* The younger players (aged 7-9) wanted the software to provide more orientation and help, and were happier to engage in solo play. The older players (aged 10-11) wanted to have social activity, more collaboration, competition, ways to express themselves and more challenges.

* The study recommended that as the BBC moves towards spaces where children are co-producers of their media experiences, it should re-examine the ethical and legal relationship between children and producers, as well as their established stance and tone. The BBC is used to treating audiences as distinctly external to its creative operations, we noted, and seems to be both inexperienced and relatively uninterested in (or over-anxious about) changing that.

In addition, we identified eight orientations to Adventure Rock. These were simplified archetypes representing the different ways in which children engaged with this world: 

1. Explorer-investigators - who had an imaginative engagement with exploring details of the virtual world;

2. Self-stampers - who wanted to make their mark on the world through self-expression;

3. Social climbers - who were interested in ranking, and wanted to be visibly doing better than other players;

4. Fighters - who wanted to be able to fight things in the world;

5. Collector-consumers - who wanted to accumulate anything of perceived value within the game; and who wished for an economic system, and also, interestingly, wanted to be able to give (and receive) gifts;

6. Power-users - who sought to become experts on the game, and how it worked; and to share their expertise with others;

7. Life-system builders - who wanted to create new environments, and to populate them;

8. Nurturers - who wanted to look after their avatar, and pets.

These orientations were not mutually exclusive, of course - the interests of any one player may include two or three (or more) of these orientations, and also of course their tendencies may change over time.

Of the different elements of the project and its findings, this set of eight orientations is the part which had some kind of lasting impact at BBC Children's. For at least a year after we presented this material, the executive in charge of interactive media, Rachel Bardill, reported that her team were regularly evaluating their different services in the light of how it might appeal to children with these different orientations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Perhaps the most useful long-term findings are the principles for building 'platforms for creativity', of use to digital designers and experience designers.
