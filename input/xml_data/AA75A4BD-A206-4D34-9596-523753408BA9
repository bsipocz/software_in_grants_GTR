The LEGIT project brings legal information about new and proposed Bills in India to relevant communities, opening up spaces for discussion and the creation of imaginative solutions through media production. Sound, video and animation translate the distant voice of legal text into more engaging forms. Production workshops and tactical media approaches encourage new points of view to be articulated and listened to. LEGIT researches how media and new technologies might be used to encourage active engagement with open governance in India, placing frequently updated information gathered from other websites alongside media works and open commentary.

Legal writing remains aloof, accessible mostly to specialists. Much of the legal writing in India is in English, a diverse country of twenty-two official languages and approximately 398 living languages, further encouraging potential audiences to disconnect from its content. The &amp;quot;opening up&amp;quot; of legislative material is therefore facilitated by workshops in close cooperation with community members, helping to guide participants in playful and creative explorations of topics under consideration by proposed or recently passed Bills. At the UnBox festival in New Delhi in January 2013, LEGIT tested explorations on paper using cut-outs of iconic imagery, reassembled and reshaped through collage and drawing. Participants also worked with re-arranging large sculptural boxes covered with icons representing pressing social concerns. These methods combining movement, interaction and drawing helped opinions to manifest and be visualised in storyboard-like forms.

Working closely with communities on-site to develop media works helps to bring some of the concerns of India's non- Internet audience to the 150 million Internet users. Providing footage to journalists and television media networks allowsoices to reach those viewers not found online.

Video and animation content is also presented on the LEGIT website alongside commentary and informational updates on legal developments in India, helping to connect communities with the legislative process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18230</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In video interview sequences recorded in 2014 these former workshop participants based in Kalimpong, India, describe their reactions and reflections on the events.

We translated this basic information into a number of languages including English, Hindi and Kaanada for the printed flyers. In collaboration with MARAA, a community organisation based in Bangalore, India, we interacted with residents of the DJ Halli slums in Bangalore, India, in order to disseminate information about local food centres provided by the government. The process brought us into closer contact with NGO's and other concerned groups working on issues affecting this community.

July 2013 marked the tragic death of a five-year-old girl due to malnutrition in the DJ Halli slum in Bangalore, India's IT Capital. In October 2013 we met with the mother and sister of the deceased in DJ Halli and witnessed developments in governmental policies since the widespread (negative) media coverage. The government run food schemes (Anganwadi centres) are at the centre of the debates about food security legislation.

In this location, co-production methods and workshops using media technologies posed more problems than practical solutions; these methods were not appropriate for the set of social concerns or working with community members in this space. In the process, we learned about the complicated terrain of the slum spaces, where laws and other regulations do not apply and where information becomes particularly slippery.</gtr:description><gtr:id>76CAD652-1EA5-4A58-96D8-74C1BB2C26A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This creative production confronted the research questions by testing the limits of legal discourse, as well as the limits of digital media. Within this slum, having access to a basic mobile phone is a luxury and even a point-and-shoot camera in an environment of poverty such as this emphasises hierarchies and power relations, making participatory media production more invasive than usual. 

Attempting to address more challenging spaces and to navigate various means of communication within spaces such as these may be the only way to adequately test the limits and limitations of digital media. In addition, communities facing basic needs related to access to food, water, sanitation, and basic medical care potentially have the most to gain from the information that digital media might provide. In the case of the DJ Halli slums, the residents face challenges in all of these areas at once. Using our methods of media production, we found ourselves better able to address one concern at a time, such as pressing concerns around access to water.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464aca872aff8.66241869</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>MARAA, Media Arts Collective, Bangalore</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This work on pending legislation in India was based on interviews with Javed Abidi and discussions with other members of the Disability Rights Group in Delhi.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9AD1A5E9-59C0-4CA1-81AC-DE398B2FECE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work was exhibited in the UnBox Festival in Delhi and in the Alchemy Festival at the Southbank Centre, London in 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54646b0454d368.72401328</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Disability Rights</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/105022077</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This short animation, &amp;quot;Clouds,&amp;quot; created by students at Kalimpong College, West Bengal, in a workshop conducted by the LEGIT team in October 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CEF8F2E1-59B4-4839-BCC8-786E0A851B04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A screening of student animation works in December 2013 fuelled enthusiasm for continuing to work in animation production.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54646626ac1205.63513263</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Kalimpong College Workshop Animation Example No.1</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/105022080</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This informational video about the Food Security Bill includes interviews with partner organisation PRS Legislative Research in Delhi.</gtr:description><gtr:id>47B3D01A-909D-43EF-8099-9F20F196F1AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work was exhibited at the Unbox Design Festival in Delhi and at the Alchemy Festival, Southbank Centre, London in 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54646a44c2e764.62580645</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Food Security Bill</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/105034013</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Art installation by collaborator Radhamohini Prasad at Walkin Studios, Bangalore, November 2015.

These interactions tested the boundaries and limitations of working with communities using participatory media methods, and also informed us about the limits and sets of problems concerning the articulation of information about government-sponsored programmes and pending legislative policies within India.
