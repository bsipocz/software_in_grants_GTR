There has been a considerable growth in the popularity and profile of folk arts in England over the last fifteen years; within this wave of new interest, internet-based resources have introduced new participants to repertory, skills and information. Simultaneously, developments in solid-state digital technology mean that musicians and dancers are now making recordings of themselves and others (for instance, in sessions, using portable digital recorders or smartphones). Far from being passive consumers of this digital media, musicians and dancers are actively developing new ways to assimilate and utilise the materials they find and generate. Amateur and professional musicians and dancers are engaging with a growing wealth of digital resources ranging from internet-based archives (e.g. The Full English) to self-generated recordings and transcriptions. The extent and nature of the impact of these digital/digitised materials to individuals, groups, amateurs, professionals and activists within England's folk scene are as yet somewhat assumed, largely unclear and under-examined, and the focus of the 'Digital Folk' project. 
'Digital Folk' will look in detail at the uses, distributions and impacts of digital/digitised materials (e.g. recordings/transcriptions/manuscript reproductions) within English folk arts cultures. The research will involve observing musicians and dancers and dancers as they utilise or otherwise engage with various materials, and will move towards building a picture of the ways in which users interact with different types and formats of resource. It will look to understand how such materials impact on the ways in which folk musicians and dancers interact with each other, and will consider the online networks and relationships that emerge between the practitioners, in order to discover how the sharing and exchange of such materials transform the social nature of folk culture. Finally, it will examine the ways in which, and extent to which, digitally-oriented activities intersect with face-to-face &amp;quot;real-world&amp;quot; interactions, and how the modernity of such activities is accommodated within new concepts of 'tradition'. The project will aim to develop a new understanding of the ramifications of digital resources for development and change in the content, concept and practice of folk arts in contemporary England.
To do this, the project will address the following questions:
1. How do traditional musicians and dancers in England use digital resources? What are the most common uses of such resources by folk musicians and dancers? What opportunities are folk musicians and dancers able to explore through those resources? 
2. How do folk/traditional musicians and dancers in England conceptualise their engagements with digital resources? Do they consider the use of modern digital tools and media in relation to the &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; nature of the music they perform? If so, how?
3. What are the emerging impacts of digital resources on the artistic and cultural attributes of England's folk arts? What impacts can be observed, and what affects appear imminent?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will directly and immediately benefit any organisation developing digital resources to facilitate participation in the folk arts: the detailed ethnography produced by the research will offer in-depth market research of the practices and attitudes of target end-users. The project's closing report will be explicitly aimed at addressing these research needs as they relate to the partner organisation - the EFDSS - by gathering information on the impact of their resources, but the nature and impact of resources produced by other similar organisations will also be assessed. Other organisations whose resources are likely to feature (and who will therefore benefit from the research) are: thesession.org; mudcatcafe.org; the Irish Traditional Music Archive; and Folkworks. However, since no such research currently exists in relation to any similar organisations worldwide, the findings of this research are likely to benefit any creators of digital resources relating to participation in &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; activities globally. 
By providing targeted findings and proposals to EFDSS and the creators of digital folk resources, the research will indirectly benefit their end users: implementation of proposals and review of resource formats in view of the project's findings will result in resource construction that best meets the needs of participants.
 
In the medium term (1-2 years from completion), there is strong potential for the research to benefit the app design and computing industries through providing detailed market research on the availability, nature and limits of existing technologies (including applications and software) to cater for the increasingly popular activity of traditional folk arts participation (as well as for creative communities more generally). 

In the longer term (c.5 years) there is also strong potential for the project to deliver findings that will be instrumental in the review of copyright policies and legislations as they relate to the distribution and licensing of &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; music. Historically, the concept of &amp;quot;the traditional&amp;quot; (particularly in relation to music) has been found to be at odds with commercially driven licensing controls and copyright law - the negotiation of an exemption for Morris Dancing in the Licensing Act 2003 shows that antagonisms of this kind continue, and the increased opportunities for the distribution of digitally recorded materials are accompanied by new ethical and commercial concerns relating to notions of artistic property and creative common-ownership within the folk arts. For these reasons, the research has strong potential to impact on the formulation of publication policies of folk music-related websites, and the licensing policies of the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society and Performing Rights Society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>219285</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Project Partnership with EFDSS</gtr:description><gtr:id>3CA07510-127F-426B-A0B7-DACA726759B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet - research is ongoing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d06a66917290.01621603-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provision of staff time, meeting room facilities and output dissemination.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provision of research designed to enhance understanding of audience participation in digital resources hosted/created by EFDSS.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Folk Launch Event (Westminster)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F6C10B7-596A-4E71-AE3F-B1169710D9C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research project was introduced to the audience by the research team; key academic and industry professionals (e.g. Library and Archives Director, English Folk Dance and Song Society; Lead Curator of World and Traditional Music, British Library) then presented their own thoughts and ideas in short provocations. Finally, a member of the project team led a participatory workshop in which speakers and attendees took part in a variety of thought experiments relating to the future of digital engagement with folk arts. Throughout the event, the speakers and workshop activities sparked questions and in-depth discussion about the nature of the folk arts in the digital milieu, as well as broader discussion on social media and digital interaction.

Responses to a post-event survey indicated that the event had led many attendees to rethink the impacts of their digital engagements and folk activities:

&amp;quot;It has made me think about how we use digital forums and tech and how digital forums and tech use and shape our own behaviour&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;It made me reconsider my attitudes towards archiving: yes archives are an important thing, but they are not the goal. It's really important that they are used by a wider audience.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Simon's anecdote about the rights/wrongs of recording in sessions was an eye opener (but then I haven't been to sessions for many years). It did make me think about what 'aural transmission' means in a digital age.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;It has made me more aware of the issues at play regarding digital technology and folk music and archives&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;I have considered the problems of preservation of formats more. I have been thinking about how we can keep up with changes in technology but still make sure things can be accessed in the future.&amp;quot;

The survey also provided evidence of the event's impact as a networking opportunity for the industry professionals present:

&amp;quot;It has connected our work with others in the field, which is helpful&amp;quot;

The survey also provided evidence of the event's sparking of future innovative/creative practice:

&amp;quot;It rekindled my interest in writing a Sibelius plug-in that accepts abc and, possibly, creates abc from a simple score.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>564603f255db28.78526010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.digitalfolk.org/london-launch-is-looming/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Folk Survey - Social Media Campaign</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1ADAB90-B626-4ADA-AC3F-1F75FE377FF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Announcement of the launch of the Digital Folk online survey was made via the project's Wordpress site, dedicated Twitter feed and Facebook page. The onward dissemination of the link to the survey via Twitter (reach of approx 4,500) and Facebook (reach of approx 520) resulted in the submission of 320 survey returns in the first 18 hours, and a second round of announcements resulted in 80 more returns. (Returns are at 532 as of 25/11/15.)

To date, an audience of over 5,000 have been made aware of the project through the initial social media campaign, of which at least 320 engaged directly through completing the survey within 18 hours of the first announcement. Further announcements have generated another 200 individual engagements with the project's data collection.

The talk integrated information about the project's aims and methods with facilitated workshop-style group activities, which successfully sparked debate and discussion. This moved beyond the basic scope of the presentation to uncover new areas of investigation.

Since the talk, one participant has approached me to investigate studying the topics further at postgraduate level. A report on the talk, and the weekend, was submitted to - and published by - Culture Vannin (Isle of Man Government), in their monthly newsletter *Kiaull Manninagh Jiu* (International email distribution list 650+, and further print distribution). Important participants for future fieldwork research were identified and recruited. The Digital Folk project in general - and survey in particular - was made known to a new audience via Soundpost's email lists and twitter interactions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5655dfabdd08b7.89016529</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.soundpost.org.uk/weekends/full-english-weekend/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation as part of English Folk Dance and Song Society, Folk Educators Group training day (Digital Edition)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AEC24AD-0D98-4878-AC18-91DEB948D005</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk introduced a variety of folk arts educators to the research, and to the possibilities of digital interaction and methods within their teaching practices.
