It has a substantial impact on patients? and their care-givers? quality of life, but its cause is poorly understood and at present there is no effective treatment. Previous research has suggested that connections between the frontal lobes (part of the brain involved in planning and abstract thought) and the basal ganglia (part of the brain involved in controlling movement) may be involved in purposeful behaviour. It is thought that damage to specific pathways may cause the different symptoms responsible for apathy, such as difficulty starting actions and reduced emotional responses. I plan to study patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Alzheimer?s Disease, two neurological disorders in which apathy is particularly common and severe, and healthy controls. I will use rating scales to measure different aspects of apathy. I will then use specific tests to investigate which psychological processes are impaired in apathetic patients. Finally, I will use a technique called functional MRI which creates images of the regions of the brain that are activated when specific tasks are performed. I will compare the brain areas activated when the three groups of subjects perform tasks related to apathy in the MRI scanner. By understanding the psychological processes and brain regions involved in causing apathy we hope to move towards developing treatments for this disabling symptom.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Relevance: Apathy is a syndrome of reduced goal-directed behaviour, which includes impaired initiation of action and blunting of emotional responses. Apathy is very common in many neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer?s disease (AD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), stroke, Parkinson?s disease and schizophrenia and is a major cause of long-term disability and caregiver distress. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies in normal subjects implicate specific frontal-subcortical systems in goal-directed behaviour and SPECT studies in disease models have provided preliminary evidence that disruption to these circuits may cause apathy. However, the contribution of individual structures and circuits to different aspects of the apathy syndrome is poorly understood.
Aims: This project aims to dissect the apathy syndrome, explore its neuropsychological correlates and investigate its functional anatomy with event-related fMRI. Through the use of two distinct disorders affecting fronto-striatal-limbic circuitry (AD and PSP) I aim to assess both general and potential disease specific aspects of the functional anatomy of apathy and its components.
Methodology: I will recruit patients with PSP (minimum n=24), patients with AD (minimum n=24) and 24 healthy volunteers. All participants will have a clinical assessment including self-rating scales to measure depression and anhedonia, cognitive testing and standardised clinical examination. Informant questionnaires will be used to measure apathy and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Detailed off-line psychological testing will be used to define more precisely and objectively the information processing deficits that underlie impaired initiation of action and emotional blunting. fMRI scanning will be performed on 24 patients from each group (12 with apathy and 12 without) and on 12 control subjects. Paradigm 1 will compare self-initiated and stimulus driven responses (predicted to activate the dorsolateral pre-frontartex [DLPFC] and presupplementary motor area [pre-SMA]). Paradigm 2 will examine responses to positive and negative versus neutral images (predicted to activate the medial pre-frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]). Analysis will examine the main effects and interactions of diagnosis and the presence of apathy and its components. 
Scientific &amp;amp; Medical Opportunities: Greater understanding of the functional neural basis of apathy will provide insights into normal cognitive processes underlying volition and motivation and will have implications for the development of treatments for this common and disabling symptom.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>185557</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2A14E6D3-95C6-46FD-982C-A7F1878A1A06</gtr:id><gtr:title>Behavioural and emotional symptoms of apathy are associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy in neurodegenerative disorders.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neurology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0ca3ebca71c2613dc6c623c79c86deae"><gtr:id>0ca3ebca71c2613dc6c623c79c86deae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stanton BR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0340-5354</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_540e140e140e1b5dd</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0500443</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CA7C1014-EC90-43EB-B9F2-C12CD9DD1A1C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.6  Psychological and behavioural</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
