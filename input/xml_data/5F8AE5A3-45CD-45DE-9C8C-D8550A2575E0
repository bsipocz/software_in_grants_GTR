Cyclin E deficient mice are nonviable as cyclin E is required for entry into the cell cycle. A conditional knockout can be crossed to mice carrying the Cre recombinase gene (which is available under many tissue specific promoters) allowing the investigation of conditional cyclin E knockout in a variety of temporally and tissue-specific models.

Sub-cloning following a new strategy is now almost complete with 7 of the required 8 steps completed for each of the 2 alleles. This is currently projected to be passed to the Harwell core service by mid June subject to sequence confirmation. The timeline from generation of the 2 constructs to viable mutant mice is currently projected to take 4-5 months with chimera generation in November. Published material targeting this locus for complete knockout suggests that both Ccne1 and Ccne2 are accessible for targeting. However, not all of this period requires Adrian to participate in laboratory work. After the construct is handed over to the Harwell core facility ES cells are generated and these will need to be screened by the investigator. This is projected to require 2 to 3 weeks during August and upon identification of suitable clones the remainder of the project is again handled by the core facility through to generation of chimeras in November. ES screening by Adrian?s assistant, Dr Woan-Ru Lin, is needed to allow him to focus upon examination preparations.

There is still considerable merit in completing this model as no equivalent model is currently published and the role of cyclin E in breast carcinogenesis in particular is still under debate. Since initiating this proposal Adrian has published his work from his previous post-doctoral position (Smith et al 2006 Oncogene 25:7245) adding to a growing field investigating the complex mechanism of cyclin E deregulatn in tumourigenesis. Indeed, his previous mentor has gone on to publish findings that extend the role of cyclin E deregulation beyond that of breast cancer and that this may well pertain to carcinogenesis of numerous organ systems (Akhoondi et al 2007 Cancer Res., 67:9006). The important distinction between overexpression of cyclin E and deregulation, especially in the absence of normal cyclin E, still warrants investigation. Furthermore, the loss of upstream machinery responsible for the regulation of cyclin E also deregulates potentially important factors such as Notch signalling and Adrian?s model specifically sets out to decouple these phenomena determining solely the role of cyclin E.

Although the ultimate objectives will inevitably be delayed, Adrian is determined to continue with this model. Achieving the milestone of generating the conditional knockouts is therefore highly desirable before he accepts his next position beyond Harwell. Any further slippage in construct preparation could feasibly be offset by outsourcing construct synthesis although ES screening may still need to be carried out in-house.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2004-08-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>491822</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6C8C048F-B6AD-42DA-9688-323D515B392B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analysis of breeding and pathology helps refine management practices of a large-scale N'-ethyl-N'-nitrosourea mouse mutagenesis programme.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Laboratory animals</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/195096ecdcda971a14e650507673f58c"><gtr:id>195096ecdcda971a14e650507673f58c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith AP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0023-6772</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5464ad1ed65234.81315998</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C70BC8E5-4C4A-4C9A-84E6-5675DE865564</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genetic analyses reveal a requirement for Dicer1 in the mouse urogenital tract.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/411d393556792535533bcc78e23abae4"><gtr:id>411d393556792535533bcc78e23abae4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pastorelli LM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0938-8990</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_16602_12_19169742</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G119/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
