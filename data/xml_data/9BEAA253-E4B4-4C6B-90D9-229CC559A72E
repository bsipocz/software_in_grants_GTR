The collection and use of this data may lead to greater efficiency, more targeted use of chemicals, higher farm productivity and stronger coordination capacity. It is also likely to bring value to those outside agriculture such as finance and real estate firms, as well as public authorities like tax agencies and environmental bodies. Yet these impacts will not be neutral; some actors will benefit more than others.

This project asks who is capturing the economic and strategic value of data? Will big business use these new data infrastructures to more deeply penetrate markets and control agricultural systems? Or will small-holder farmers use them to 'de-commodify' their goods (through organic or fair-trade labeling), and increase their profits and security? Will these systems lead to more controlled workforces and thus weaker labour rights? Or will these systems allow unions to enforce stronger worker protection? Will these systems strengthen the power of US based entities or will they even the playing field for African economic actors? 

Much depends on how governance evolves and which groups claim ownership and control. Our project takes a 'Political Economy' approach to these questions and thereby documents the role that politics, ideas and ideology play in determining who benefits from growth and digital transformations. We examine power struggles between actors over the control of economic and strategic value both at the local level on farms (between owners, workers, traders and agribusiness) and at the national/international level (between policy-makers and firms over public policy and finance for innovation).

We examine these power struggles in two valleys: a developed agricultural cluster (California's Central Valley) and a developing agricultural cluster (Kenya's Rift Valley). Both valleys are hugely productive agricultural heartlands and are also situated near to advanced technological clusters. We take this transnational approach because US commercial interests are part of African agriculture; one cannot understand development without understanding their power and influence. In addition, extremely important conversations are taking place within US farming about data ownership and commercialization, which are likely to have implications in Africa and other regions including the UK.

This project is important because governments all over the world are prioritizing public support for the tech industry as it is seen as the driver of future economic growth and employment. To ensure that this growth is both inclusive and transformative, it is vitally important for public officials and the public to understand the distributional impacts of digital innovation policies, particularly in agriculture, a sector that employs huge numbers of poor people across the world and serves as the ecological base of human life. Data will no doubt revolutionise our economies but we must ensure it does so in inclusive and sustainable ways.

Practically, our project aims to equip policy-makers with evidence and ideas to help them develop smarter and more inclusive digital economy policies and to raise ground-level awareness among farmers and workers about how they can expand control over their privacy and economic infrastructures. We do so through traditional outreach meetings with beneficiaries, policy briefs and publications but also through entertaining and accessible podcasts, co-produced with professional journalists. Academically, we aim to theorize the role that politics and ideas play in influencing who benefits and loses from technological innovations, and to contribute developmental and cross-national perspectives to the field of the political economy of innovation and digital economy</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have thought carefully about societal impact. Over the past six months, we have consulted with beneficiary communities in developing the research questions, research methods, and outreach activities. In addition, we have formed an advisory board (grouped into teams) to help continue this dialogue and make sure the research is relevant to wider communities.

The research will have broad relevance to many groups. It aims to deliver practical advice to farmers about data security, privacy and the pros and cons of different digital business models. It aims to inform data ethicists and activists about how ordinary people think about privacy, how they perceive digital risks and whether they value privacy against convenience or cost. It aims to inform those working in organizations like AGRA, Open Data Institute, the WEF and UN Global Pulse on how Open Data policies and private agreements might come to reflect everyday privacy needs as well as more explicitly economic development objectives. It aims to provide economic policy-makers with sound understandings of how digital business models work and provoke discussions about which business models and R&amp;amp;D arrangements might best facilitate sustainable and equitable growth. Lastly, it aims to engage all audiences (including the general public) in broader debates about the nature of digital capitalism and the social, economic and political impacts of digitization.

Impact will be driven by 3 main components: 1) professionally produced podcasts aimed at publicizing insights widely, 2) interactive website designed for education purposes and 3) outreach meetings to generate focused discussions around policy implications and solutions.

1) To make insights widely available and appealing, the team will use podcasts as the prime medium of dissemination. We have formed a communications team composed of experienced radio journalists and podcast producers. This team will join the researchers at the host institutions at stages 1 and 4 and at periodic points during fieldwork to help collect audio content and use their skills and artistic talents to develop compelling storylines. The podcasts will focus on the impacts identified above, and will be developed and agreed in consultation with the researchers. To maximize impact, these podcasts will be broadcast through the team's subscribed channels as well as through the website to ensure insights flow through existing networks and reach large audiences. 

2) The website will be designed to be interactive, yet mobile user friendly. At its heart will be an educational 'tracking tool' that will explain data privacy and business models in a simple, engaging way. Building on Tactical Tech's Trackography and AFB's Transparency Evaluator, it will be designed for unions, cooperatives and development organisations for training purposes. We have decided to target organisations rather than individuals to help support collective learning and action. The website will also feature other audiovisual materials such as photos and videos, and will host a podcast archive focused on data economies. We will also design the website to be useful to teachers delivering courses on Critical Data studies as well as International Development in universities.

3) Two-day dialogue is important, so we have planned 3 outreach meetings in the UK, US and Kenya, focusing on the question: How might we re-conceptualise data as a strategic economic resource for inclusive development? These meetings will provide concrete empirical evidence about data-driven change and will be designed to help farmers and policy-makers be strategic in their dealings with Agritech firms. The team will map out data value chains and help identify policies to promote inclusive distribution of benefits. These meetings will result in 2 short policy briefs and 2 additional policy-focused podcasts.

Given the high priority accorded to social impact, we have budgeted adequately for Impact activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>537068</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P009603/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>69128365-74B2-4A08-8067-57863ECCB013</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>African Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC53A3F2-81B6-40C9-874D-291D23B3C79F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F354373F-6BF5-4763-845E-4A4681AE3A8F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
