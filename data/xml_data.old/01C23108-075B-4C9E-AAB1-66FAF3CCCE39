In natural biomineralisation processes the self-assembly and recognition properties of peptides are exploited to deposit inorganic materials with exquisite structures and highly specialist functions (e.g. teeth, bones, armour), and these principles can be used by synthetic chemists, nanotechnologists and surface scientists for control over materials structure and properties.

Due to their high surface areas, tuneable compositions and functionality microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) assembled from metal ions and organic linkers have demonstrable applications across numerous sectors (e.g. energy, sustainability and healthcare), but a degree of processing is often required in order to facilitate their practical use. This is a rapidly growing area of MOF chemistry and while significant progress has been made, challenges in the preparation of thin films and MOF-based composites still remain. If peptide sequences that can specifically recognise these important framework materials could be readily identified, then greater control over MOF structure, properties and deposition could be afforded.

In this work we will use combinatorial libraries of viruses called bacteriophages to identify such peptides. Each phage displays a unique peptide on its surface, and the library contains millions of different viruses and hence potential binding sequences. This process is known as phage display. By exposure of MOF crystal surfaces to the phages over several cycles the strongest binding sequences can be determined as a function of framework composition, connectivity and particle size/shape. Once identified, the peptides can be synthesised and exploited for biomineral-inspired MOF synthesis.

The ability of the identified peptides to direct MOF growth will be investigated permitting control over physical aspects of the MOF crystals such as size and shape, with potential to further influence the network structure and porosity of the framework itself. These are important properties for gas storage, catalysis and drug delivery. An understanding of MOF-peptide interactions will be beneficial to the latter, and our studies of the binding interface will provide valuable data. 

Biomineralisation processes are characterised by the ability of organic molecules, including peptides, to deposit inorganic materials under mild conditions. Some MOFs such as those based on titanium remain challenging to make, but are a highly desirable synthetic target for their photoactive properties and clear applications in photocatalysis, light harvesting and energy generation. To overcome some of these synthetic barriers we will use peptides that specifically recognise the mineral titania as a strategy to discover new titanium-based MOF photocatalysts for sustainable applications.

The peptides derived from phage display will also be able to specifically recognise frameworks based on composition, functionality and crystal face. This recognition capability will be exploited for enhanced MOF interfacing with other functional components such as metal nanoparticles and biomolecules to yield new composites optimised for catalysis and adsorption. By patterning surfaces with multiple peptides, the ability to localise different MOFs into pre-defined positions will allow the preparation of multifunctional MOF thin films, a major step toward realising MOF-based devices for electronic, optical, sensing and energy applications.

The project outlined is necessarily and strongly interdisciplinary in nature, spanning combinatorial biology, materials science, surface science and nanotechnology, further supported by computational chemistry, to advance the science and technology of MOFs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252548</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>510000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Probing mechanisms of biological-material interactions; towards realizing biominetic materials by understanding molecular-level interactions</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Airforce Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>FA9550-16-1-0213</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>A9D19A7A-4FED-4E0C-9A67-280796FF5125</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ae3b591f79.52029146</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>'This award is still in the very early stages but we have discovered that strongly-binding peptides for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) identified via the combinatorial phage display method can influence the assembly and crystallinity of the frameworks. In the first few months our investigation has centred on two well known MOFs, namely UiO-66 and ZIF-8 which are both very stable to the phage display conditions. For UiO-66 functionalization of the framework with an amino group (UiO-66-NH2) results in a unique binding sequence from a phage library of 10^9 possible sequences whereas the non-amino derivative yields a small number of binding sequences. This implies that frameworks bearing additional functional groups have a greater potential to have a unique binding sequence, and this is under further investigation by preparing mixed-linker analogues to modulate the degree of amine functionalization. This is facilitated by the modular nature of MOFs and provides unique opportunities for the application of the phage display method.
Following preparation of the identified sequences we have investigated their ability to influence UiO-66-NH2 synthesis, and find that the presence of the peptide allows the framework to form under conditions where this would not normally happen mirroring naturally occurring biomineralisation processes. Likewise UiO-66-NH2 does not form in the presence of peptide sequences that are raised against the non-amino derivative.
We have also employed both crystalline and amorphous ZIF-8 phases for phage display and identified slightly different sequences for each. Interestingly, when the peptide raised against the crystalline phase is added to the amorphous ZIF-8 synthesis conditions the material forms a crystalline phase implying the information contained within the peptide can code for this. It seems that for ZIF-8 a small number of peptides can induce this crystallinity and we are investigating this further to determine whether this is a more general phenomenon e.g. for MOFs with no specific functionality.
Overall these are key findings that clearly demonstrate for the first time that the application of genetically modified libraries to identify strong peptide binders for MOFs, can result in sequences able to direct the biomineralisation of these important framework materials.'</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Design of materials (not necessarily MOF related)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B145FE82-1BFF-4FEE-AE76-28CF61AC696C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7befde068e8.41678114</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N026071/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
