They would have encountered many alternative and often conflicting versions of the same story, and many very different stories illustrating the same moral principles. The proposed monograph, &amp;quot;Roman Exemplary Wisdom: exempla in Roman ethics&amp;quot;, demonstrates that this variety and multiplicity played a vital role in stimulating ethical reflection and development in members of Roman society. Through close analysis of a wide range of ancient Roman texts, including, in particular, the works of Cicero, Seneca, Valerius Maximus, Velleius Paterculus, Silius Italicus, Quintilian, Plutarch and Ammianus Marcellinus, it explores the way that the ancient Romans used heroic tales from their past as an important cultural resource for learning about, and thinking through, key moral issues (for instance about the ethics of war, sex or politics). It investigates what these sources can tell us about how a concise, pointed narrative can encapsulate a complex moral idea, how ancient Romans were expected to apply the moral message from an exemplum to their own lives, and how these exempla offered guidance for moral decision-making and behaviour. It also explores the question of what sort of ethical system provided the framework within which historical exempla were for centuries a key medium for mainstream education as well as informal life-long moral development. This research project is the first detailed study of the ethical dimension of the Roman exemplary system, and it develops some exciting new ideas about Roman ethics which have relevance for modern education and ethical enquiry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My impact plan will develop the potential of my research into ancient exempla to contribute to the delivery of key skills and ideas in Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE)/citizenship education in schools. This has the potential to benefit teachers and young people (aged 14-18) and in the longer term (with follow-on funding) I plan to develop the resource with a view to it being adopted more widely in PSHE teaching, at first in Devon, but potentially nationwide. Young people working with my resource pack will be learning ethical and deliberative skills, so there will also be a longer term benefit to society at large, as these young people carry these skills and moral awareness into their adulthood and their interactions with others.

During the period of the AHRC fellowship, I will collaborate with experienced youth facilitators, teachers and young people in a day-long consultation/workshop to devise and produce a resource pack designed to be used in the delivery of PSHE/citizenship education in secondary schools, drawing on the ideas and material generated by my research project. This resource pack will have the potential to: Enable secondary school teachers to deliver their PSHE requirements in an innovative way, through integration of material into existing creative courses; Enable young people to develop their skills of ethical deliberation and argumentation; Enhance young people's understanding of particular ethical issues related to their personal and social development, including e.g. the relationships and tensions between the needs of individual, the family and the wider society, military ethics and international law and diplomacy; Introduce young people to some core aspects of Roman history and culture and raise their awareness of the richness of Classics as an academic subject; Vastly increase young people's appreciation of the enduring power and relevance of material from ancient Rome.

This impact plan addresses itself directly to some of the key questions set out in the AHRC theme overview &amp;quot;Concern for the Future: Thinking Forward Through the Past': How can we better exploit the potential of the past to be used as a lens for looking to the future? How can narratives, images and representations of the past, present and future better inform current ideological, ethical and moral debates and frame debates and perspectives about the future? The consultation workshop and resulting resource pack set out to develop a mechanism by which the exemplary narratives from the past can inform pressing moral debates among young people today. Working with the resource pack will raise young people's awareness of the differemce between ancient and modern cultural values and the way they change over time. The exemplary tales transmitted by the ancient Romans clearly show how different their perceptions were of e.g. individual rights and responsibilities, social and inter-generational justice, and civic values. An appreciation of this difference opens up the possibility of a nuanced and historically informed understanding of the issues surrounding these ideas in a contemporary context, and their implications for the future. Use of the resource pack within the curriculum will also demonstrate the value of historical knowledge and narratives for exploring complex ethical ideas in the present and it has the potential to improve the way historical knowledge and experience informs future policy in areas such as law, education, and international diplomacy.

Therefore, as a follow-on project, I will pilot this resource pack in two local schools, using my established contacts with Exeter College and West Exe Technology College in Exeter. I will evaluate its success in consultation with teachers and the regional head of PSHE for Devon with a view to developing the resource and methodology for long-term use in schools through the region and possible nationwide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35189</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>775A5C1A-46F5-44C3-BB18-6AD458E9B668</gtr:id><gtr:impact>talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards
