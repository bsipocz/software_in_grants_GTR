The focus of the research project is a case study, YourPaintings Tagger, an important new crowdsourcing initiative in the Arts and Humanities. YourPaintings is a major new digital art collection from the Public Catalogue Foundation (PCF), comprising digital images of 200,000 publicly-held oil paintings in the UK, 80% of which are currently not on public display. This exciting new resource will be completed in 2012 and mounted on the BBC website, where the collection will be freely available to all. In advance of its public launch, YourPaintings is embarking on a crowdsourcing initiative to create and enhance metadata for the collection. The YourPaintings Tagger will ask the public to provide supporting information for the digital images, from simple descriptive tags to information about sitters, locations and artists. By monitoring the usage and impact of this initiative from the ground up, the project will consider the potential of crowdsourcing techniques in the Arts and Humanities.

Crowdsourcing initiatives have become increasingly popular means of generating content and analysis from large data sets. They have many advantages, offering a cost-effective means of adding or engaging with content, bringing researchers into contact with the public in innovative and involving ways, and generating interest in and access to scientific and cultural resources that can be hidden from public view. These initiatives are also politically timely, as they conform to the government's drive towards a 'Big Society', in which 'people power' is harnessed to enhance community resources. Thus far they have primarily been located within the sciences, with successful initiatives such as Galaxy Zoo, e-Bird and Foldit leading the way. These techniques are now spreading to the Arts and Humanities, with manuscript projects such as Transcribe Bentham and Old Weather now in their early stages. YourPaintings Tagger is an innovative attempt to bring crowdsourcing to the Arts via a major publicly owned cultural heritage resource, and to introduce the strategy of asking for community contributed content as an integral part of resource development. In addition to analysing a large data set that will be a crucial addition to the research community, publicly contributed metadata will allow all visitors to the YourPaintings site to search and discover the collection.

This project will examine the impact of this crowdsourcing initiative in the Arts and Humanities community, asking whether it succeeds in encouraging the public to contribute quality data, and investigating what impact this data has on the digital resource YourPaintings. It will look at user communities, how users contribute data, what kind of data they contribute, and how this data is viewed by different (expert and non-expert) users. It will look at communities, both of resources and of people, to show how these intersect with one another and how YourPaintings Tagger impacts upon them. 

The results of the research will be disseminated to the widest possible audience, through traditional academic outputs such as conference and seminar papers, peer-reviewed publications, a project website and workshop, as well as through contacts with policy and third sector organisations facilitated by project partners at the PCF and BBC. Discussion of methods used to conduct the research will be contributed to the JISC-funded Toolkit for the Impact of Digitised Scholarly Resources together with guides to any new techniques or methods developed during the research project. This free resource can be found at www.microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/tidsr.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Besides the academic beneficiaries detailed above, the project will have a significant impact on three main groups:

The Research Community
Previous work by the Investigator in this area has both benefited greatly and created greater impact through connections to wider research networks (such as bloggers, professional communities and a range of practitioners outside academia), facilitated by online networks. While project workshops such as the one proposed are an essential means of meeting, sharing and debating with colleagues from a range of disciplines, online networks can reach a greater audience and create cost-effective and sustainable connections and communities. The Investigator will reach out to these audiences through the project website, and through content contributed to the JISC-funded Toolkit for the Impact of Digitised Scholarly Resources: www.microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/tidsr. The Toolkit continues to be cited and used by JISC in funded projects across a range of disciplines involving both academic and non-academic groups.

The General Public
The resources at the heart of this study are publicly owned and will be co-created by the public. The Investigator will work closely with key project partners the PCF and the BBC who have supported the proposed project to maximise public engagement with these resources. The project partners will keep in regular contact with the Investigator and the project, and will have the opportunity to apply lessons learned during the project directly to the resources, benefiting all users.
While this case study focuses on crowdsourcing within the Arts, insights gained can be applied to the application of such techniques across disciplines, and will therefore benefit a wide range of resources and collections of interest to the general public. In order to ensure the widest possible impact in these areas, the results of the project will be widely disseminated and information about the methods used will be freely available via the TIDSR toolkit.
Initiatives such as YourPaintings Tagger have the opportunity to transform opportunities for knowledge transfer, a key aspect of any institution's role. Recent JISC-funded work has suggested that user-generated content and citizen science projects have the potential to create opportunities for knowledge exchange, creating the potential for two-way enrichment of research by facilitating meaningful contact between researchers and the general public. The Galaxy Zoo project has shown the potential of this type of knowledge exchange, by recruiting the general public to contribute to both general and specific research questions. This research project will contribute to research into whether such a model can succeed in an Arts and Humanities setting, and point to a future of more interactive and enriching knowledge exchange endeavours.
High quality digital resources can be very expensive to create, whereas user-generated content can be relatively cheaply acquired, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional forms of tagging and cataloguing. If this model is successful, it could be applied in a wide range of settings, aiding the development of high-quality, inclusive and educational resources to which the general public will be actively encouraged to contribute.

The Public Sector
The results of this project have the potential to influence policy in funding councils and charities, a major source of funding for the creation of digital resources. There has been considerable interest in the potential and actual impact of community generated content and citizen science projects from funding councils, as a potentially cost-effective and mutually beneficial source of data and education. This research will provide a test case of crowdsourcing in the Arts and Humanities which will demonstrate how to provide accurate metrics of such initiatives, and will consider the educational, social and cultural contexts of such contributions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33232</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Ashmolean Museum</gtr:department><gtr:description>Cabinet team partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>A531BA53-70F1-4B00-B17D-E64C3C14E487</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main outcome of this collaboration has been a grant from the University of Oxford's IT Innovation fund in order to develop the 'Cabinet' platform for teaching and research.

On this occasion we invited visitors to tag in any language, in an effort to see how many languages we could collect by the end of the night (we are still analysing this data). This was by far our most successful 'live tagging' event, in terms of the number of visitors who participated, and generated some fascinating conversations about the richness of language. We found that, like our previous events, the tagging was particularly successful with children, who spent 10-15 minutes each creating a set of (rather than one or two) tags.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ab41ede748.03704729</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.creativeml.ox.ac.uk/linguamania</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ashmolean Museum Live Friday event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E78B3F0-19B5-4ED3-8F7C-AD1DFAEC6430</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I created a 'live tagging' installation at the Ashmolean Museum's Live Friday event in May 2015. The idea was to demonstrate how crowdsourcing descriptive metadata from the public works (frequency of terms, different words for same item etc), to allow people to understand how they could contribute to tagging, and to disseminate some of the results of the project (tagging has an impact on wellbeing and language skills). Live Friday events typically attract a very broad audience, and we had over 4,500 members of the public in the museum during the evening. I spoke to a large number of members of the public that evening, and there was a lively discussion around the tagging process. I subsequently used this model for teaching visiting doctoral students which was a huge success and has really shaped my own teaching practices.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16c6fd94d93.35096850</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ashmolean.org/livefriday/2015-05/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ashmolean Live Friday Public Engagement activity</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF6A1451-DCB1-4015-A560-86AA872702D1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This Live Friday event was a demonstration of research activity being supported or celebrated via TORCH, the Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities, as part of the Festival Finale of the Being Human Festival. Though the evening was named 'Fright Friday', the themes of the Being Human Festival were 'Hope' and 'Fear', so we chose paintings from the Ashmolean/ArtUK collection (formerly Your Paintings) representing these themes, and asked members of the public to tag them using sticky notes. The aim was to demonstrate how crowdsourcing works, why it is effective, and to showcase some of the findings from the original AHRC project around tagging and wellbeing. The most striking outcomes from this demonstration were the extent to which we appealed to younger children (in particular, boys under 12) many of whom spent more than 15 minutes tagging, and an invitation to participate in the next Live Friday event around multilingualism (in January 2017).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a8bf8494d8.15050301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://torch.ox.ac.uk/frightfriday</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media interest (Guardian)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>281CD884-4FA2-45D6-B036-1D43EB480F70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My article sparked a range of interactions on Twitter, drawing me into a network of early career scholars, and by email as I was contacted by other early career scholars interested in sharing their information with me.

I have given numerous talks at conferences and workshops on understanding usage and impact, with particular reference to crowdsourcing, and have become an adviser to cultural institutions interested in understanding crowdsourcing and how it may be used. For instance, I have worked with the Happy Museum organisation to develop methods for using crowdsourcing to gather data on visitor engagement and wellbeing in cultural spaces. I have also disseminated my findings to the broad range of stakeholders interested in crowdsourcing, including the scientific and gaming communities, and to library professionals interested in applying crowdsourcing to their collections, as evidence of what impact crowdsourcing can have at the individual level.

The project found that although productivity levels were below what the project architects had hoped for, the crowdsourcing was generating high quality tags and had a small but dedicated audience of contributors (Taggers) including a group of super contributors who were responsible for the majority of the tagging work. The project found that the motivations for contributions were similar to other (quite different subject area) crowdsourcing projects such as Galaxy Zoo, with the addition of it having been identified as a useful teaching resource. There was also evidence of the relationship between tagging and wellbeing in many of the contributors, and the ways in which 'virtual volunteering' as part of a (in this case cultural heritage) crowdsourcing project could become a valuable means of remaining connected to a meaningful task and collection where traditional volunteering was not an option.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I intend to take these findings forward through collaborative work with colleagues in Psychology to investigate the relationship between 'tagging' and wellbeing. My findings contribute to a picture that is being built up of the potential for understanding engagement with cultural heritage through technology, the impact of crowdsourcing on volunteers (particularly wellbeing), and the potential for formal and informal education through crowdsourcing. These findings are relevant to anyone in the GLAM sector, or anyone with interests in digital cultural heritage or crowdsourcing.

The findings from this award have led to ongoing collaborative work with the Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums sector, particularly the University of Oxford's museums, around the themes of engagement, wellbeing, impact and visitor experience. In particular, in 2015, we were successful in being awarded funding to develop an online platform to engage students with museum objects as part of core undergraduate teaching, in which we encourage students to 'tag' and annotate objects as part of their learning. This experimental platform draws directly on initial findings from the 'A Museum without Walls' project, and analysis of engagement through this new platform will lead to further research outputs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C4A45CD4-2544-42B5-81C4-4EC0CB8C5F29</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464d59a31dc58.04641877</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=138</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A0F3BA0-7113-445B-8017-DFB776CAC646</gtr:id><gtr:title>Crowdsourcing our Cultural Heritage</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ec41d4d54367145994a1a3b5dc575f08"><gtr:id>ec41d4d54367145994a1a3b5dc575f08</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eccles, K. and Greg, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4724-1022-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5464c9a167abe3.03994604</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J003077/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0A982A4A-12CF-4734-AFCA-A5DC61F667F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Information &amp; Knowledge Mgmt</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
