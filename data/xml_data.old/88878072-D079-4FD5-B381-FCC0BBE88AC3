One such compartment known as the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) specialises in
processing proteins into their correct shape. In certain types of secretory cells such as antibody producing plasma cells or insulin producing beta cells the requirement
to fold these extracellular proteins can increase many fold. The ER has developed a number of strategies to cope with the sudden increase in processing proteins by
making use of a cell signalling response pathway termed the unfolded protein response, UPR. The initial activation of the UPR is thought to involve a particular region of a sensor protein known as LD. It is thought that LD interacts with a ER resident chaperone protein BIP, that helps to process secretory proteins. There are a number of models that suggest how the presence of incorrectly folded protein leads to activation of the UPR. In this proposal we aim to structurally characterise the interaction between the LD and chaperone protein BIP to understand the mechanism for activating the UPR. 

A failure or incorrect activation of UPR can lead to many disease states including diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer. In cancer the solid tumour environment lacks nutrients and oxygen due to the incredible pace at which tumour grows. In order for the tumour to survive this harsh environment the UPR is switched &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;. Furthermore in antibody producing plasma cells a downstream component of the UPR has been implicated in multiple myeloma and is dysregulated, therefore inhibition of UPR would help to alleviate this condition. This makes inhibition of UPR an attractive target for anticancer therapeutics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>To investigate the mechanism of activation/regulation of LD domains by BIP and to resolve the different models that have been proposed we aim to map the interaction between the LD domains and BIP by initially using a biophysical approach to discern the specific regions involved in this weak and transient interaction. We also aim to structurally characterize the molecular nature of the interaction and to propose a model of regulation by BIP. Visualizing the molecular details of interaction will allow us to introduce mutations into the site which we can characterize by measuring its effects on the interaction affinity. These mutants would also be valuable reagents to probe further the mechanism of action within the lab and also for the UPR research field as a whole.

Objectives 
1) Mapping the interaction site of BIP and LD domains.
2) Crystal structure of BIP-LD complex
3) Structure validation using interaction site mutants

Technical summary
A major effort will be directed towards cloning and over-expressing various protein constructs and purifying these constructs using standard chromatographic techniques in order to obtain homogeneous protein for biochemical and structural purposes.
For Protein - protein interaction studies between the LD and BIP constructs we will use pull-down assays, Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST).
For structural studies, purified protein will be set up using commercially available screens on the crystallisation robot and optimised using hanging drop crystallisation method again using specialised plates for crystallisation. Crystal diffraction optimisation can be done using the in house X-ray source and data collection will be conducted at the diamond light source.
For mutation analysis again requires cloning and purifying protein constructs and then using techniques mentioned in protein-protein interaction studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact of our work will be for scientist within the field of research. However there is potential for generating peptides that could inhibit the UPR and this would be of interest to drug development companies. The central role that UPR plays within the cell and the serious consequences of inappropriate activation can result in many diseased states including diabetes and cancer. The inhibition of UPR is actively pursued as a strategy for anti cancer drug programmes and knowledge relating to inhibition of UPR will generate interest within such circles. If a successful inhibitor of UPR was identified the benefits to human health would be great since this would 
in theory help reduce the size of tumours or in diabetes help reduce insulin resistance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>207480</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A49EEBE3-BEC6-492F-9FFF-302A4BB960E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Noncanonical binding of BiP ATPase domain to Ire1 and Perk is dissociated by unfolded protein CH1 to initiate ER stress signaling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>eLife</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e04d2ad0f0b433775b8db6a840952eff"><gtr:id>e04d2ad0f0b433775b8db6a840952eff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carrara M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2050-084X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>563b523eedfdd8.94890168</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1A9B7F8E-D4AE-45A7-93A9-A19C87CFF2F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Crystal structures reveal transient PERK luminal domain tetramerization in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The EMBO journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e04d2ad0f0b433775b8db6a840952eff"><gtr:id>e04d2ad0f0b433775b8db6a840952eff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carrara M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0261-4189</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>563b52c9b9e1c6.15216393</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/L007436/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
