Electroencephalography (MEG) and Quantum Technology (QT) magnetometery, undertake a systems engineering review of MEG, informed by current art MEG, and a review of the clinical requirements of a hypothetical diagnostic room temperature MEG system. This will identify technical requirements of future QT based magnetometers as enablers of future room temperature MEG designs, and will form the core of the technical review being undertaken by the research team in support of the project.

The systems engineering review exercise will also contribute to the requirements analysis activity being led by the
commercial partner. The PI and CIs will contribute via a series of workshops and interviews with the commercial partner that will identify key elements required for a room temperature MEG system and associated MEG QT magnetometer designs.

Research team support will also contribute to the competing technologies analysis, specifically proving inputs into the
functional capabilities of MEG compared to other systems in the analysis and diagnosis of a range of mental health
conditions, and the relative advantages / disadvantages of these MEG functionalities. Similarly the team will contribute
specialist knowledge and guidance in supporting the commercial partners research and development of potential applications and market sizes for posited MEG capabilities in future, as well as contributing to the drafting and review of the MEG prototyping road map.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the near term the immediate impact from this research is as an enabler supporting those researchers and developers planning new research and development activities for room temperature MEG. In supporting a market study and road mapping exercise this research seeks to define an economically valid and coherent development pathway for a diagnostic MEG capability. Development of low TRL prototype systems such as room temperature MEG, into mature, commercially viable capabilities is often delayed, or even stopped, as they transition from low TRL research activities to mature high TRL capabilities - in the absence of a clearly defined economic rationale and a clear route to commercial prototype, many technologies struggle to secure the research and development funds required to translate across intermediate TRL stages.

The provision of a strategic vision based around a clearly defined forecast capability and a defined economic rationale will form a critical component of future research funding justifications required to accelerate research into the development and commercialization of MEG as a diagnostic tool in coming years.

Ultimately the research will impact all those that benefit from earlier and improved mental health diagnoses enabled by the ubiquitous presence of diagnosis capable MEG systems. These will offer significant impact on the quality of life for many people, as well as reducing, at a national level, the costs of long term mental health care.
Additionally, the development of such a capability will have a significant economic impact for the UK. Bringing to market a real-world diagnostic MEG product which exploits new quantum technology will establish the UK as a leader in the field. It will bring substantial benefits to the UK economy, supporting the creation of a next generation MEG sector in the economy, encompassing design and build of room temperature QT-MEG scanners, data analysis and interpretation diagnostic sub systems through to the training and employment of new clinicians with expertise in neurology and mental health to support and employ these new capabilities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15920</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R024154/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
