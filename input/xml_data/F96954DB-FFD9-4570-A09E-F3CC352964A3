This cytoskeleton is a highly organized network of filaments containing actin together with a wide range of ancillary proteins. Some of these proteins control the equilibrium between monomeric and filamentous forms of actin, while others connect filaments together or link filaments to membranes and cellular organelles. Recent work has focussed on a class of essential proteins that promote disassembly of filamentous actin. These proteins are widely distributed in animals and plants and cells lacking them cannot live. ||Two highly related proteins, actin depolymerizing factor and cofilin have been identified and we are analysing their interactions with actin by a variety of biochemical and kinetic means. We use electron microscopy to analyse the structural changes induced in filamentous actin when they bind. We are currently attempting to solve the structures of the proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance. We are trying to crystallize complexes of these proteins with actin to determine their structures by X-ray diffraction. We are examining the localization of these proteins in cells by transfecting cells with fluorescently labelled ADF/cofilins. In this way we can find out how the location of these proteins within cells and consequent cell behaviour is changed when cells are stimulated with growth factors and hormones.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our general aim is to understand the molecular basis of cytoskeletal rearrangements that are essential to all motile processes in cells (locomotion, phagocytosis, cell division etc). In all these processes, there are changes in the actin cytoskeleton that involve a variety of binding proteins and signalling mechanisms. Defects in cytoskeletal function are found in many diseases, notably cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.||One key family of proteins that play a critical role in the dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton are the actin depolymerizing factors (ADF/cofilins). The aim of the project is to elucidate the mechanisms of their interaction with actin and their role in cell motility. ADF and cofilin are closely related and occur in the same cell, but they have very different depolymerizing activities. Our first objective is to investigate these differences in terms of biochemical activity and molecular structure. Understanding the structural basis for the differences will facilitate research on their individual regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions. ||The first objective is to establish the nature of differences in depolymerizing activity between ADF and cofilin. We found that ADF predominantly acts to disassemble filaments while cofilin binds to F-actin and, when over-expressed in cells, this promotes filament formation. Detailed biochemical and kinetic analysis will be used to achieve this goal. The two human proteins are over 70% identical in sequence; thus the differences in activity must be due to structural changes that arise from the sequence variation between the two proteins. Hence it is essential to solve both their structures. The structure of ADF was determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) methods some years ago. Attempts thus far to determine the crytal structure of human cofilin by X-ray methods have not been successful. Although this work continues, including attempts to crystallize complexes with actin, we are now using NMR to solve the structure of cofilin. ||The severing activity of these proteins on F-actin is thought to relate to the change in twist induced in the filament structure when they bind. Differences exist in the extent of twist change induced by various ADF/cofilins from different species and these differences should be related to their biochemical properties. Mutagenesis has already been used to identify the sites on ADF/cofilin involved in F-actin binding and this work will be extended to confirm the key residues involved in distinguishing ADF from cofilin.||There are a number of ancillary proteins that modulate the effects of ADF/cofilin on actin dynamics and their interactions with actin and ADF/cofilins need to be elucidated. One of these proteins, Aip1 was first identified in yeast as a protein modulating the interactions of ADF/cofilins. We plan to investigate how Aip1 enhances the depolymerizing effects of ADF/cofilins and explore the interaction with other actin- binding proteins involved in promoting cytoskeletal rearrangements.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1989-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7639</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>07BA2AEA-5460-4AB4-979D-72305457A69B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping the ADF/cofilin binding site on monomeric actin by competitive cross-linking and peptide array: evidence for a second binding site on monomeric actin.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of molecular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/53e6ebdefd44307ed5f15db874a42864"><gtr:id>53e6ebdefd44307ed5f15db874a42864</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mannherz HG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-2836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>013AAE9C8FB</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2AB888C1-E2B2-4810-9B19-42190DEF2B2D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dual effects of staurosporine on A431 and NRK cells: microfilament disassembly and uncoordinated lamellipodial activity followed by cell death.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of cell biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/53e6ebdefd44307ed5f15db874a42864"><gtr:id>53e6ebdefd44307ed5f15db874a42864</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mannherz HG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2006-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0171-9335</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>E4FB841F5EB</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U105184340</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
