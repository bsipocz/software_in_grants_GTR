In order to mitigate this threat, for example in the design of suitable vehicle appliqu&amp;eacute; and passenger seating arrangements, the blast loadings from buried charges need to be characterised. Experimental studies of IEDs are absolutely vital, but are expensive to conduct. Therefore, a numerical simulator capable of capturing the key effects of IEDs is required to perform virtual studies.

The loading generated in buried charges is highly dependant upon the the response of the soil in which these devices are buried, both in terms of the blast wave in the surrounding air and the impact of soil particles. The response of the soil is highly dependant upon the level of water saturation and the gas pressures developed within the pore space. The soil affected by the charge will undergo gross deformations which will require specialist treatment numerically, beyond the capabilities of conventional continuum mechanics frameworks. In order that the threat posed to the vehicle occupants may be mitigated, a fundamental understanding of the loads applied to vehicles by these devices is required.

The intended primary impact of this research is the development of a numerical simulator. The understanding of the blast loading resulting from IEDs will lead to improved design of mitigating measures for existing and future military hardware. The project will benefit defence researchers and contractors charged with the evaluation of retrofitting technologies for the mitigation of the threat posed by IEDs. The essential model reduction focus of the research will inform specialists of which aspects of the problem physics are key, and cannot be ignored. 

This numerical simulator will help allow engineers to make more objective decisions on the likely safety of vehicle occupants, and therefore has the clear ptential to save lives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most obvious potential beneficiaries of the research are those who could fall victim to the effects of IEDs or other buried charges, such as land mines, (whether this be the soldier in an active combat theatre, a munitions disposal expert engaged in post conflict clearance or civilians who could benefit if lethal devices are cleared more effectively as a result of better designed equipment).

Engineering practitioners involved in the design of IED mitigating measures (e.g. vehicle appliqu&amp;eacute; materials and systems, munitions disposal equipment etc.), will benefit directly from the research by having access to guidance on how numerical models may be reduced in terms of the level of detail necessary to realistically model the effects of IEDs. In the medium term, they will benefit from having access to a new generation of simulation technology, capable of better predicting the magnitude and spatial &amp;amp; temporal variation of the pressures induced by IEDs.

Regular meetings with scientists from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) will take place over the duration of the project; directly communicating recommendations on best practice for modelling the response of IEDs will provide an efficient dissemination route. The findings of the research will then permeate into commercial practice as a result of the guidelines DSTL will make available to defence contractors.

In the longer term, it is anticipated that the techniques developed will be incorporated into commercially available specialist or industry standard software.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97204</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I037547/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5AAD42DB-C6CB-4B09-8555-8ECA565B6B59</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ground Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
