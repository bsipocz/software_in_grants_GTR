Resilience</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M002012/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed seminar series critically examines the emergence of a variety of collaborative and cooperative housing projects in the UK, noting the relevance of cohousing as a concept that combines protected elements of household privacy within a self-governing cluster of (20-30) households sharing outdoor space and communal facilities. The cohousing approach is collaborative because it embeds self-managed governance structures (such as co-production of building and landscape design) in the life of the community in a deliberate attempt to increase purposeful interaction between resident members to improve quality of life. While existing literature documents a rich history of radical experiments in communality, as well as enduring attempts by town planners to engineer social interaction between neighbours, the UK lags behind Continental Europe and North America in terms of completed housing schemes that reflect a culture and politics of everyday practices of sharing. This picture has changed dramatically since 2007 when the UK Cohousing Network began as an umbrella organisation for established and forming cohousing groups. Today there are 50 developing cohousing groups in the UK, an 80 percent increase in two years. A further 15 groups are recently established. Significantly, growing interest in approaches to community living and cooperative ownership and management of neighbourhoods is not confined to the grassroots. Mainstream media coverage lists cohousing among the 'top ten' solutions to the UK housing crisis and the language of government policy increasingly positions community-led housing development as a civil society self help response to loneliness, ageing with choice, and as an effective scale of influence for carbon-reduction and technology adoption. 

In the proposal we stress the need to look beyond the confines of the home and the household in order to understand the positive contribution of a collaborative scale of congregated housing with social mechanisms for collective decision-making in carbon reduction behaviour, green technology adoption and community resilience. We stress the need to conceptualise resilience not only in terms of material and technological efforts to tackle housing and environmental vulnerability, but also human capacities for organising and living collectively. Tackling the combined challenge of housing affordability and sustainability requires not only methods of collaboration between civil society, third sector and state agencies, but also integrated and broader scale analsysis of community engagement and practice. The seminar series will explore complex and diverse ways of thinking through collaboration, resilience, affordability and ecological citizenship and bring this theorising to bear on everyday dilemmas facing diverse demographic groups.

The proposal would see the formation of a new interdisciplinary network that will strengthen links between UK and international cohousing networks and make possible new constellations of collaboration at the intersections of housing access and affordability, green technology, ecological citizenship and community resilience. Through a series of six events, including visits to iconic collaborative housing projects, the network will exchange knowledge and understanding on cutting edge comparative research and practice; it will develop a frame of reference for terminology and concepts to be used in multi-media published outputs. Each seminar draws on a suite of national and international reference projects that will help translate community-led housing into tangible evidence: this aspiration to 'mainstream' collaborative housing is shared by politicians, municipal authorities, third sector organisations, many academics and activists. The proposal benefits from the PI's proven track record in delivering two successful seminar series': Time-Space and Life-Course, and Working Class Lives, Geographies and Sociologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the applicants' multi-disciplinary expertise, the proposal is directly co-produced and informed by, and intended to have immediate intellectual and practical impact for; resident groups and associated housing service providers seeking to build novel, low-impact, democratic collaborative housing communities. 
The proposal will build on and extend existing networks of other non-academic user-groups that exist across a host of institutions and third sector organisations. 
Overall the output from this series will be of significant interest and relevance to politicians, planners, policy-makers and voluntary sector organisations interested in expanding capacity for collaborative housing as one expression of community-led development. Within the UK, interested parties (already engaged with the applicants in various ways) will include, but will not be limited to: 
- Homes and Communities Agency (and Department for Communities and Local Government)
- Local planning authorities
- SME builders, intermediaries; architects, specialised consultants
- Community Land Trust Network
- HQN Network custom-build
- Confederation of Cooperative Housing
- Radical Routes
- International Communal Studies Association (the current President is Chris Coates, resident of Lancaster Cohousing)
- Housing companies/ housing associations
- Transition Town Network
- Schumacher College
- Findhorn Foundation
- Third Sector Research Centre
- Building and Social Housing Foundation
- Locality
- Community Build 
- National Association of Self Builders
- In Newcastle upon Tyne: the Quality of Life Partnership and Elders Council (following on from action-research with Jarvis as co-applicant looking at opportunities for senior cohousing in the north east). 
 
The proposal has clear relevance for local and regional development because national programme developments, including the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, Localism Act 2012 and specific programmes and initiatives ring fenced to community led development such as Community Led Affordable Homes Programme Funding, dedicated development service to support the transfer of public assets into community ownership, all demonstrate a receptive environment of policy and action.
The proposal will also benefit residents and would-be residents of collaborative housing communities. Regional event locations have been chosen to maximise impact by locating near to grassroots projects and demonstrator initiatives. For instance, the Newcastle event will gain input from four pioneer groups; a senior group in West Northumberland, an intergenerational group in Newcastle, a similar group in Durham, and a group of artists seeking to develop an affordable live-work community in Sunderland. 

The proposed seminar series fits well with a number of ESRC thematic priorities, most notably around deepening civil and civic engagement and democratic renewal towards 'a vibrant and fair society'. Questions of fairness that are addressed by the seminar series also make implicit connections to thematic priorities concerning how to improve local resilience, as a combined function of affordability and sustainability. By critically examining how cohousing community groups challenge energy-intensive privatised modes of dwelling, the seminar series will help us to better understand how to influence behaviour (through group support and peer influence, for instance) for targeted intervention to promote sustainable household practices. The proposal also will also enage with societal challenges threading through the Horizon 2020 EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation; 'Europe in a changing world - inclusive, innovative and reflective societies', especially 'social innvoation community' and 'climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials'; 'Health, deomgraphic change and wellbeing', especially 'support older persons to remain active and healthy'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27351</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborative Research on Collaborative Housing- COST Proposal, Europe-wide (supporting applicant)</gtr:description><gtr:id>132C3B24-3AB4-47C8-9244-54DFD08A05C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-applicants on the COST submission are also contributing papers to a special session on Collaborative Housing at the ENHR 2016 conference in Belfast:

The launch was held in the Boothroyd Room of Portcullis House (PCH) and was hosted by Richard Bacon MP.
The morning began with a moving and fitting tribute to Jo Cox MP, tragically murdered last week, who had been invited to speak at the event because of her inspirational work with the Hermitage Community Moorings at Hermitage Wharf, in Wapping, where her visions for justice and societal progress translated into a unique form of cooperative living and community support.
The event then included a presentation of findings by the academic team, that can be accessed here; and responses by a panel of distinguished speakers, including:
? Dr Nick Falk, Urbed 
? Chris Brown, Executive Chairman, Igloo regeneration 
? Sophia de Sousa, Chief Executive, The Glass-House Community Led Design
The report presents the main findings of a wide-ranging two-year knowledge-exchange programme carried out in partnership with the UK Cohousing Network involving cohousing practitioners and academics. The central message is that wider adoption of cohousing and other community-housing approaches could benefit not only residents themselves but the neighbourhoods around them and the wider housing market. The report sets an agenda for policy makers, practitioners and researchers in the years ahead.
The launch event immediately followed the final (6th) seminar in the series, with an audience representing a broad mix of politicians, policy makers, housing industry and non-profit practitioners, as well as activist representatives seeking to influence political support for community-led housing. Conversations with Richard Bacon MP were especially positive and it is promising to note recent developments in this regard, such as the governments announcement on 23rd December of &amp;pound;60 a year to help fund community-led housing projects in England. Discussion also focussed on practical measures of support for local authorities to enable them to promote and support legal obligations to maintain Self and Custom Build Registers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>587f2edd68b598.94564017</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lselondonhousing.org/2016/06/parliamentary-launch-cohousing-shared-futures/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>http://collaborativehousing.net/

One of the recipients of bursary funding in the first of the six seminars in the series, Bill Phelps, has been instrumental in developing Chapeltown Cohousing: http://www.chapeltowncohousing.org.uk/ 
Chaco are a pioneering success story and Bill attributes this in part to the impact of the ESRC seminar series, network and knowledge exchange. ChaCo have won &amp;pound;55,000 in grants to help obtain planning permission, they expect over &amp;pound;2 million from capital sales and grants towards shared ownership, and they already have over &amp;pound;400,000 towards our target of &amp;pound;600,000 in loanstock offers. A key part of their financial model is to create affordable homes for local people: around two-thirds of our members will be from the local area; ChaCo will offer rented accommodation at a level that those on benefits or low incomes should be able to afford.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E7A6DB4A-4F08-488B-97B9-B0F2C9668158</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d4bf8976dc45.63205177</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Funding was granted for a seminar series rather than a piece of research. In this context, discovery entailed a gathering frame of consensus on the critical questions and policy priorities for community-led housing (CLH) as a sector; specifically cohousing. The grant facilitated the development of a new interdisciplinary network, six knowledge exchange events, site visits to exemplary CLH projects (in Leeds, Lancaster and Sheffield), new research partnerships, and novel methods of reaching a wide audience and demonstrating impact. 
Discovery combines a network of learning and support for the growth of CLH as a sector and, within this, specific focus on cohousing in the UK today. Emphasis on two tiers of influence (umbrella and niche) emerged as a key finding of the seminar series:
(i) The umbrella terminology of CLH is used to represent a coherent sector capable of creating a more diverse and stable housing market that is less prone to speculation and volatility; capable of delivering housing of high quality, affordability, sustainability and resilience. There is also greater pressure to build common agendas and networks to scale up CLH as a sector. 
(ii) At the same time, different organisational forms endure through historical legacies and commitment to a particular view of the building process or outcome. The proliferation of difference is not necessarily disruptive to sector development. Niche housing forms represent a potent seed-bed for innovation and alternatives, both social and technological, which are stifled by the mainstream regime. 

A practical focus on cohousing emphasised the role this blend of private and shared space and community decision-making could play in addressing failings in mainstream housing. Six themes were explored to develop critical questions and identity gaps in knowledge: sharing; mutuality; affordability; design; mainstreaming and awareness; and knowledge.
Our work highlighted the complex, deeply rooted problems of the wider housing system. This complexity calls for solutions such as cohousing that harness collective capacity for behaviour change and innovation at all stages of design, build and occupation. 
Across these themes, we identified a number of key findings:
In the UK, there is increasing demand for cohousing and other CLH choices
Internationally, as in the UK, the diffusion of cohousing innovation has been a long and difficult process, often lasting decades. 
In the UK, many cohousing groups struggle to get off the ground. Newly forming groups tend to reinvent the wheel, particularly when it comes to procurement. 
By comparison with other mixed-market economies the UK is both late and slow to deliver even a modest supply of community housing. Comparisons can be problematic due to differences in terminology but it is revealing that there are only 19 established cohousing communities in the UK versus over 600 in Germany. 
Cohousing communities often perform better in economic and ecological terms than conventional speculative owner-occupied housing. These communities can be more affordable because facilities and resources are shared. They can reduce energy demand, waste and consumption by supporting sustainable practices. 
These socially connected communities also have undeniable though less tangible social benefits for members and society at large, such as increased well-being, shared know-how, and mutual care. We need to find better ways of evidencing these benefits. 
Cohousing could become more widely adopted if planning, financial and institutional infrastructures were better designed to support it (as in the USA and many countries in Europe). 
Cohousing communities in many ways reflect the societies in which they are embedded and are not always free from inequalities based on gender, age, race and income. Recruitment processes, for example, can produce groups that are homogenous in terms of any or all of these attributes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings were presented in Parliament on the 22nd June 2016 with a launch of a final report 'Cohousing: Shared Futures'. The launch was held in the Boothroyd Room of Portcullis House and was hosted by Richard Bacon MP. We have presented our findings to key people and at key events such that we can claim considerable political and policy impact in the context of major government investment in the CLH sector. Direct contributions include with DCLG and the AAPG National Housing Taskforce on New Sources of Housing Supply. We generated multi-media published outputs, including a word-press blog; highly visual final report and emphasis on 'seeing is believing' first-hand demonstrations of innovation in the field. We made a short film to illustrate the knowledge exchange and learning process; how participants tackled the critical questions posed. We circulated this via email and on our web and showed it at events. We developed a virtual 'jiscmail community' (66 members) by which to explore issues between seminars and circulate news of relevant events. These novel methods of reaching a wide audience and demonstrating impact have paid off in the wide variety of ways our findings have been taken forward by others, capturing their imagination.
