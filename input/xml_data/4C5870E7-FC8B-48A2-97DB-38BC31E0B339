(RASP-UK)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/M016579/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Severe refractory asthma affects approximately 2% of the UK population, and has a total healthcare cost that is greater than that for all of the 10 - 15% of the population with mild/moderate asthma. International asthma guidelines advise the 'step-wise' increase of inhaled and oral corticosteroid treatment. However, for severe refractory asthma, the response to corticosteroids is often poor, and doctors often escalate to high dose inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Recent data suggests that this &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; approach to asthma treatment is poorly targeted. Our industry partners are developing new drugs for severe asthma, which will require a targeted approach in patients to identify who will respond.

We propose a two level approach:

(i) In some patients with severe asthma, a key clinical problem is non-adherence with corticosteroid therapy (non-adherence is where patients, intentionally or non-intentionally, do not take their prescribed treatment). This is common and is poorly recognised by physicians. It can result in patients being inappropriately labelled as having 'corticosteroid resistant' disease, and may cause patients to be escalated to more complex and expensive therapies, when they could be controlled on inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Assessing adherence objectively is a pre-requisite to optimising corticosteroid therapy. This programme will assess adherence using remote monitoring technologies and non-adherent patients will be assisted and managed within their clinical service.

(ii) Some severe asthma patients have inappropriate increases in corticosteroids in the absence of corticosteroid responsive inflammation, and this can cause significant harm due to treatment side-effects, without any treatment benefit. Our programme will validate a new way to optimise corticosteroid therapy using simple blood (blood eosinophil count, serum periostin level) and breath (exhaled nitric oxide) tests of corticosteroid response across the major United Kingdom Clinical Centres for Severe Asthma. We know that patients with low measures of these biomarkers have a low chance of having an asthma attack and we can safely reduce and optimise their corticosteroid treatment dose. This process of corticosteroid optimisation will identify two populations of severe asthma patients, with different patterns of lung inflammation, one with corticosteroid responsive disease with high eosinophils (these are inflammatory cells recruited to the lungs in asthma) which we call &amp;quot;T2-High&amp;quot;severe asthma and the other with corticosteroid unresponsive disease or &amp;quot;T2-Low&amp;quot; severe asthma. The T2-High group will be available for clinical trials of novel treatments which have already been developed by the Pharmaceutical Industry. We currently understand much less about the T2-Low group, and they will be studied intensively with measures of lung function and other tests including airway sampling using bronchoscopy (a telescope test in the lungs to get airway samples) . We will also follow them up for 12 months to see if they remain stable on their optimised corticosteroid dose and if the pattern of inflammation in the lungs changes over time. This strategy will help us identify new drug targets for this group, and these patients will then be able to enter trials of these novel treatments.

This programme is the first to take this type of stratification approach in severe refractory asthma, specifically to assess objectively adherence to current treatment, and then to test a way to optimise corticosteroid therapy. It will provide a world-leading step change in the care of patients with severe asthma. It will also enable a clinical trials programme to be expanded within the UK Severe Asthma Clinical Centres to allow the safe and targeted testing of new treatments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This programme will test a novel stratification strategy in severe asthma to improve clinical management and accelerate development of new therapies. There are 4 components:

1. Stratification by adherence to regular corticosteroid (CS) treatment. Objective identification of adherence to inhaled CS to (a) precisely identify truly CS unresponsive asthma phenotypes where new drugs are needed and (b) avoid inappropriate use of new complex therapies in patients who could be effectively controlled on inhaled CS.

2. Biomarker-based titration of CS therapy. In the absence of CS responsive inflammation, clinical response to CS is minimal and inappropriate CS escalation causes significant morbidity. In a 1-year, multi-centre randomised clinical trial, comparing biomarker titrated CS therapy to standard care, we will examine if individualised titration of CS dose using validated biomarkers (exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophil count and serum periostin) improves asthma outcome. This will also address another key question, specifically what proportion of patients with severe asthma develop typical eosinophilic airways inflammation associated with Type 2 cytokines (T2) on progressive CS withdrawal.

3. Identification of new therapeutic targets. Prior genetic/mechanistic studies of asthma have not stratified on inflammatory phenotype; thus, understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in which T2 inflammation is absent is poor. We will undertake deep-phenotyping of the stratified cohorts to identify important structure/function relationships.

4. Clinical trials programme for new T2 and non-T2 therapies. Stratification by inflammatory phenotype is central to novel target-specific therapies and biomarker-driven therapeutic options now exist for severe asthma. We will use our established clinical infrastructure to engage with pharmaceutical companies to facilitate access to stratified severe asthma patient populations for Phase 2 proof of concept studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Patients - will benefit through the development of a logical approach to treatment, based on an innovative and objective biomarker-driven algorithm. Currently, treatment is based on a &amp;quot;blunderbuss&amp;quot; approach using high dose corticosteroids, without definite clinical effectiveness in any individual, but with predictable long term side-effects. This is unacceptable for the estimated 50% of severe asthma patients who do not respond to escalation of corticosteroid therapy. This programme will firstly assess adherence using simple home-based remote testing, and then secondly validate a simple clinical biomarker based algorithm, to optimise an individual's corticosteroid dose. This will improve patient outcomes, and many patients will have their corticosteroid burden reduced, with fewer long-term corticosteroid side-effects. Optimised patients with persistent severe asthma will then be able to take part in trials of novel targeted treatments. International treatment guidelines will adopt this strategy for severe asthma and Consortium members will disseminate data to support evidence-based management of severe asthma worldwide. Asthma UK is a Consortium partner, represents the patient's interests, and will lead on the communication of the outcomes to patients.

Clinicians - will be able to adopt outputs from this programme with an immediate and direct impact on clinical care. They will be able to identify poor adherence and engage in a transparent discussion with patients. The composite biomarker strategy (exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophil count and serum periostin) will be easily transferable into the clinic and will deliver more effective targeting of corticosteroids. These tests are simple, rapid and reproducible and will enable 'near patient' testing to make treatment decisions in severe asthma. Clinicians will avoid inappropriate use of novel biologics, and will be able to target them more appropriately.

Academics - will benefit from improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying different asthma endotypes. The POC studies clarifying the role for novel therapies directed against NOX4 and other novel molecules will be central to a stratified approach in severe asthma. We recognise that even with the new therapies in development, we are unlikely to have all the tools to treat all aspects of severe asthma and our stratification programme will facilitate the identification of new targets for the 'non-corticosteroid responsive' aspects of asthma, which will also in the longer term, provide substantial patient benefit.

Industry - Our industry partners have helped shape the programme, and strongly endorse the Consortium's stratification approach. Non-adherent patients often become adherent with corticosteroid therapy when closely supervised in clinical trials and as a result, trials are underpowered. Defining a 'gold standard' assessment of adherence will reduce trial size and/or increase power and save costs. Diagnostic companies in our Consortium will have the utility of the novel strategy assessed independently. Therapeutics companies will have access to cohorts of precisely phenotyped patients for the identification of novel targets, and for the testing of targeted new treatments. In the long term, it will provide a world-leading cohesive and stable clinical infrastructure, to design and deliver stratified proof of concept clinical trials, and thus speed up the drug development process.

Healthcare providers and policy makers - will have additional information relating to responsiveness and non-adherence to corticosteroid treatment and a strong evidence base for introducing new and expensive treatments for severe asthma. Targeting new treatments to responder populations will deliver economic benefit by avoiding inappropriate use of expensive novel therapies in patients who are either non-adherent with simpler less expensive treatments, or whose inflammatory phenotype is unresponsive to a new medication.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4836444</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>RASP UK Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>85F8A1CE-CD91-4AA8-862F-E4DA9AD745DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications

The RASP-UK consortium is led by Professor Liam Heaney, a professor of Respiratory Medicine at Queens University Belfast and consultant physician at Belfast City Hospital. Professor Heaney is an advocate of a stratified approach to providing optimal care for patients with severe asthma. He founded the British Thoracic Society Difficult Asthma Network and the affiliated National Registry on Difficult Asthma in 2006. He now co-ordinates and manages the registry, which facilitates research into the assessment and clinical management of difficult asthma, standardising UK specialist clinical services.

Professor Heaney's research group at Queen's University Belfast, have conducted award winning research. His team defined the significant scale of the problem of non-adherence to treatment in patients with severe asthma and the group are addressing this by developing clinical tests utilising exhaled nitric oxide suppression and biomarkers, for use in clinical assessments of non-adherence.

His contribution to asthma research also spans the establishment of in vitro cell models and he has pioneered work on non-bronchoscopic sampling of paediatric airways for the advancement of studies on airway disorders in children. Professor Heaney continues to collaborate with industrial partners, concerned with profiling genomic expression for biomarkers.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MedImmune</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>RASP UK Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>954A2CC3-85AC-4020-ADD2-01672D9855E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications

The RASP-UK consortium is led by Professor Liam Heaney, a professor of Respiratory Medicine at Queens University Belfast and consultant physician at Belfast City Hospital. Professor Heaney is an advocate of a stratified approach to providing optimal care for patients with severe asthma. He founded the British Thoracic Society Difficult Asthma Network and the affiliated National Registry on Difficult Asthma in 2006. He now co-ordinates and manages the registry, which facilitates research into the assessment and clinical management of difficult asthma, standardising UK specialist clinical services.

Professor Heaney's research group at Queen's University Belfast, have conducted award winning research. His team defined the significant scale of the problem of non-adherence to treatment in patients with severe asthma and the group are addressing this by developing clinical tests utilising exhaled nitric oxide suppression and biomarkers, for use in clinical assessments of non-adherence.

His contribution to asthma research also spans the establishment of in vitro cell models and he has pioneered work on non-bronchoscopic sampling of paediatric airways for the advancement of studies on airway disorders in children. Professor Heaney continues to collaborate with industrial partners, concerned with profiling genomic expression for biomarkers.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Genentech</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>RASP UK Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>67DBB854-B447-4E68-A03D-74A6E823D6BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications

Objectives
To improve understanding of the mechanisms of Xolair by assessing the effect of 16 weeks treatment with Xolair on urinary excretion of a key metabolite of prostaglandin 2 (PGD2), 2, 3-dinor-11-?-PGF2a.

To identify biomarkers which are predictive of a good clinical response, with the measurements of biomarkers being done after the first 16 weeks of treatment.

Evaluate the value of using other clinical endpoints, either alone or in combination with measured biomarkers, to predict which participants treated with Xolair will benefit in terms of clinical improvement after 16 weeks of treatment and after 1 year of treatment.</gtr:description><gtr:id>09C4AEB6-C7B4-443E-8588-18350DCD18A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A at this stage</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c29898e99d20.29187767</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Late clinical evaluation</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Somosa Study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Drug</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/ctu/trialportfolio/listoftrials/somosa</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2015</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>This is a multi-centre bronchoscopy study designed to investigate the underlying molecular pathways driving severe asthma.

Treatment guidelines advise the 'step wise' increase of corticosteroids but the response is often poor as this &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; approach does not benefit all patients. Characterising a patient's response to treatment will help our understanding of non-response and will aid development of new drugs for severe asthma.

The RASP-UK Consortium brings together a partnership of clinical and academic excellence from UK Universities and NHS Severe Asthma Centres, together with the Pharmaceutical Industry. Our primary focus is to target corticosteroid treatments more effectively and to understand why some patients do not respond to corticosteroids. Our industry partners are developing new treatments for severe asthma that will be tested in these patients and asthma 'biomarkers' will be identified to predict response to these new therapies. Two approaches will initially be used to differentiate between patients who respond and do not respond to corticosteroid treatment, as follows:

 In some patients with difficult to treat asthma, the problem is non-adherence, whereby patients, intentionally or non-intentionally, do not take their prescribed corticosteroid treatment. This is common and is poorly recognised by doctors. This can result in patients being inappropriately labelled as having 'corticosteroid resistant' disease. Assessing adherence objectively is a pre-requisite to optimising corticosteroid therapy. The Consortium programme will assess adherence using remote monitoring technologies and non-adherent patients will be assisted and managed within their clinical service.
 Some severe asthma patients have inappropriate increases in corticosteroids in the absence of corticosteroid responsive inflammation, and this can lead to harmful side-effects. Our Consortium will validate a new way to optimise corticosteroid therapy using simple tests of corticosteroid response. We know that patients with low measures of certain asthma biomarkers have a low chance of having an asthma attack and we can safely reduce and optimise their corticosteroid treatment dose.

This approach of corticosteroid treatment optimisation will identify two populations of severe asthma patients, with different patterns of lung inflammation, one with corticosteroid responsive disease which we call &amp;quot;T2-High&amp;quot;severe asthma and the other with corticosteroid unresponsive disease or &amp;quot;T2-Low&amp;quot; severe asthma. The T2-High group will be available for clinical trials of new treatments which have already been developed by the Pharmaceutical Industry. We currently understand much less about the T2-Low group, so these patients will be studied intensively to help us identify new drugs for this group. They will then be able to enter trials to test these new drugs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9692E789-B5FD-4460-ACA5-3F5940DCBE94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not applicable yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c186830c71e5.97303192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Late clinical evaluation</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>RASP UK Biomarker Study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Management of Diseases and Conditions</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.rasp.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2015</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:clinicalTrial>true</gtr:clinicalTrial><gtr:description>Biomarker based assessment of adherence with inhaled steroids (FeNO suppression test)
Non-adherence with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in poorly controlled severe asthma is common and consistently associated with poor clinical outcome. Adherence intervention studies using monitoring technologies and behavioural interventions have yielded mixed results but most studies have not aligned interventions with &amp;quot;biomarker based&amp;quot; assessment of therapeutic response to interpret clinical outcome. Poor adherence is a major stumbling block to improving asthma control and the development and validation of readily available protocol-driven adherence assessments would minimise the risk of committing patients with severe disease to inappropriate long-term expensive biological treatment. A number of novel biologic therapies targeting the Type-2 cytokine axis have shown efficacy in patients with severe asthma and payer organisations (e.g. the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK) provide guidance on access to these treatments. They are recommended as add-on therapies to optimised standard treatment including high dose ICS along with other controller medication, but no guidance is given on how to determine optimised standard therapy or adherence. Assessment of adherence to inhaled treatments can be challenging and physician estimate and patient self-report consistently overestimate adherence when compared to objective measures and other surrogate measures such as prescription records have limitations. Monitoring technologies remain the gold standard in clinical trials but clinical services have been slow to embrace these as part of routine care. We need to move away from trying to use challenging and imperfect surrogate measures of adherence to measuring the response to ICS using a responsive biomarker (fractional exhaled nitric oxide - FeNO). In patients with difficult to control severe asthma, this approach (FeNO suppression test) has previously been shown to identify &amp;quot;clinical non-adherence&amp;quot; when used with directly observed treatment over a seven day period. 

RASP-UK has now demonstrated that the FeNO suppression test can be delivered in routine clinical care and is straightforward to use for both the patient and the clinician. Profiling the FeNO response to ICS in patients with difficult to control severe asthma identifies a substantial population of patients who derive important clinical benefits from monitored ICS/LABA treatment. This approach also assists patients who wish to engage with a monitoring strategy in routine care and identifies patients who despite good adherence with inhaled treatment are likely to require additional treatment. Profiling the FeNO response to ICS exposure in patients with difficult to control severe asthma is a helpful part of clinical phenotyping and can usefully identify those who are likely to respond well to standard care with optimised treatment. In addition, aligning monitoring of ICS treatment with FeNO response will help exclude ICS responsive non-adherent subjects prior to recruitment to clinical trials investigating &amp;quot;add-on&amp;quot; interventions to standard care. This approach will also facilitate mechanistic studies investigating true ICS resistant disease. Future studies are required to identify the optimal intervention to maintain ongoing adherence in a difficult to control severe asthma population, but understanding the potential therapeutic benefit in an individual patient is an important component of routine assessment and clinical decision making.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C05B817-D3A1-4BD5-93B3-C919D00DFE04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Manuscript under review.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c29a85ed9f93.20378434</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Service Evaluation of FeNO suppression test in severe asthma clinics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Diagnostic Tool - Non-Imaging</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2017</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C6696A90-C01B-40D2-BD76-2A67F1CDA1E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>A randomised pragmatic trial of corticosteroid optimization in severe asthma using a composite biomarker algorithm to adjust corticosteroid dose versus standard care: study protocol for a randomised trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f66649f6be4ab9bff62b8af0dbccc409"><gtr:id>f66649f6be4ab9bff62b8af0dbccc409</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hanratty CE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1745-6215</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa66ff495c488.81244716</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5E71E2FB-4343-486A-BFC7-430B3FE20E31</gtr:id><gtr:title>Research in progress: Medical Research Council United Kingdom Refractory Asthma Stratification Programme (RASP-UK).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Thorax</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b1d28acfed61c9b1b3cab0ed10cce6c"><gtr:id>0b1d28acfed61c9b1b3cab0ed10cce6c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Heaney LG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-6376</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d58050efd56.57917140</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>56A43056-59AA-4977-8DD4-474BC1EDEAB5</gtr:id><gtr:title>S2 Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (feno) suppression to identify non-adherence in difficult asthma</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Thorax</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/73a5de93700197a2963f2e7aaf050030"><gtr:id>73a5de93700197a2963f2e7aaf050030</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hetherington K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7dcbec8ba06.92705000</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B2CFA7EC-A105-4153-AB99-6B296BC57A6B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Drug therapies in severe asthma - the era of stratified medicine.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Clinical medicine (London, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0513205813895639a1f857fddeb25010"><gtr:id>0513205813895639a1f857fddeb25010</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hetherington KJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1470-2118</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a5998be37f81.53004848</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M016579/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
