Impact</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N003624/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal has been developed collaboratively by four project partners: The University of Newcastle (PI - Prof. W. Weileder); international visual arts commissioning agency Locus+, Newcastle; Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London; and Canary Wharf PLC, London. 'TRANSFER-Impact' is a twelve-month project with a proposed start date of 1st December 2015. 

The main aim of the project is to expand the impact of the 2006 AHRB funded 'TRANSFER' project and its outcomes demonstrating new and innovative ways of what site-specific public art could be, where it could be located and how it could address different and unexpected audiences. This was achieved mainly through a temporary architectural-scale installation in which a 1:1 replica of the Milton Keynes art gallery was simultaneously constructed and deconstructed over a three-week period at Station Square, Milton Keynes. 

Our new proposal employs the practice-based methodology of 'TRANSFER', expanding its audience and amplifying its outcomes for a worldwide distribution by:
(1) re-presenting 'TRANSFER' in a new way and with new and different partners;
(2) in a new and high profile location at Montgomery Square, Canary Wharf, London; and
(3) through new media, specifically experimental film and contemporary dance.

(1) This Follow-on project proposes a new collaboration with Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London, in two ways. First, the innovative architectural fa&amp;ccedil;ade of the Laban Building (Herzog &amp;amp; de Meuron Architects, 1997) becomes the source for the architectural installation at Montgomery Square, London. Second, the project expands on the performative dimension of 'TRANSFER' through the production and presentation of new site-specific and stage dance works that highlight the spatial and time-based aspects of the original research, linking it directly to the use and purpose of the new Laban Building. The partnerships with Locus+ and Canary Wharf PLC are also mayor impact enhancemet factors in this proposal (see below).

(2) The choice of Montgomery Square, the central circulation hub within the Canary Wharf estate, ensures exposure to a new, diverse and wide public audience. Over 100,000 people work at Canary Wharf, the majority of whom will pass through Montgomery Square on their way to and from work each day. During the working week an estimated 70,000 people use the Montgomery Square exit/entrance of Canary Wharf underground station and thus will have a direct and daily encounter with the installation over its two-week duration. 

(3) One of the outcomes of the original research was time-lapse film footage that was used to create a four screen video installation made specifically and only for the main exhibition space at Milton Keynes Gallery. The Follow-on project will generate similar footage but in this case this will be used to distribute the 'TRANSFER' research to a worldwide audience through the development of a new experimental short film for international film festivals and exhibitions. The footage will also form a central part of the stage-based dance performances at Trinity Laban.

A key impact enhancement factor of this proposal is the involvement of and partnership with internationally acclaimed visual arts commissioning agency Locus+. Locus+ works with a strict peer review process ensuring that all its projects achieve a high critical reputation within the art world and beyond. The artwork installation and the film will be profiled as part of Locus+'s on going project portfolio, giving it longevity beyond the 12-month timescale of the Follow-on project. For 'TRANSFER-Impact' Locus+ will act as sponsor, producer and project manager for the architectural-scale installation at Canary Wharf and the experimental film, taking responsibility for all aspects of production and promotion. Locus+ will also lead on the international marketing, media and press strategy for the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The opportunity to participate and engage with the 'TRANSFER' research outcomes in the form of an architectural installation, a series of dance performances, as well as a new experimental film will have a direct cultural, social and economic impact on the following three user groups and communities: 
(1) General public audiences at Montgomery Square (an estimated weekday audience of 70-100,000); at Trinity Laban stage performances; and at international film festivals and exhibitions. 
(2) Professional national and international user groups and audiences in the field of art, architecture, contemporary dance and the building industries. 
(3) New educational audiences, specifically staff and students at Trinity Laban.

In what way will the 'TRANSFER-Impact' Follow-on project generate and enhance the cultural, social and economic impact of the original 'TRANSFER' research outcomes for these user groups and communities?

(1) General public audience: 
1. The general public audience will gain access to new and high quality cultural experiences that will stimulate them to think about the role and function of urban public place and contemporary art and its relationship to inner city regeneration.
2. The installation and on-site performance will raise the public profile of Montgomery Square as a cultural site emphasising the role and value of cultural activity within corporate urban space.
3. The audience experience of the on-site performance will widen their understanding of what contemporary art in the form of dance can be, how it might engage with public space, and who it might be for.
4. Through their experience of the varied artistic outputs of the project they will develop their awareness and understanding of the contemporary artistic discourse around temporary vs. permanent and process vs. product, as intended in the original research.

(2) Professional national and international audiences:
1. It will enhance cross-disciplinary exchange between art, architecture, and dance organisations and the building industry, demonstrating innovative ways in which future collaborative practices could be developed.
2. This unusual cross-sector collaboration will also have a direct impact on policy makers and commissioners of public art and urban regeneration programmes by developing their understanding of how public audiences might be addressed by and engage with such work.
3. It will increase the professional reputation of project partners through their association with innovative public art and high profile academic research.
4. The connection of art and industry within 'TRANSFER-Impact' furthers the original process of knowledge/technology and skills transfer between a new and extended group of professional user groups and audiences.
5. Involved construction industry participants will gain access to emerging construction practices, including the latest dry joint building methods and system scaffolding technology, which are still unusual in the UK.

(3) New educational audiences
1. Engagement with the project will give Trinity Laban participants an insight into innovative visual art research methodologies and new understandings and experience of site-specific practice and experimental film. 
2. By participating directly in the development and performance of the collaborative dance works, both on-site at Canary Wharf and at the Laban Centre, staff and students will also gain a unique opportunity to showcase their own skills and creative ideas and to promote these through new and innovative distribution channels.

Additionally, this project provides new knowledge and insights for practice-based research by creating a better understanding of the potential of sculpture and dance collaboration. 'TRANSFER-Impact' presents cross-artform collaboration on a new scale in a high profile public context for an international audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80009</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Transfer Laban is a time-based architectural installation at Montgomery Square, Canary Wharf, London, 13-24 June 2016.
A 40m wide section of the main fa&amp;ccedil;ade of the Laban Dance Centre, Deptford (Herzog &amp;amp; de Meuron Architects, 1997), was simultaneously constructed and deconstructed in the heart of Canary Wharf. Over the two-week period the sculpture gradually moved across the square, sequentially recreating the whole Laban Centre fa&amp;ccedil;ade. Built from white lightweight concrete blocks and supported by a system scaffolding structure, each section of the fa&amp;ccedil;ade was visible for only a single day, before being deconstructed and rebuilt as the next section in the architectural sequence.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EF3045F5-BBD9-4C8C-B6F5-E1DC87C0F428</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Transfer-Laban Installation was exhibited at Montgomery Square, Canary Wharf, London, 13-24 June 2016 as part of the London Festival of Architecture 2016. Over the duration of the project the artwork was experienced by more that 10000 people from diverse audiences. Questionnaires were distributed by volunteers over the course of the project. Although a lot of people stopped to look at the project and we witnessed a lot of repeat visits, many people who experienced the work were either on a lunch break or on their way to or from work. Some example quotes from questionnaire feedback include: It's amazing - We have been sitting in our office wondering what it is! - Thought it was a rock-climbing wall at first, then thought the builders had made a mistake. - It's good to see something that doesn't have a clear end point. - I don't normally see art, but this is interesting.

Working with the Canary Wharf Group, Locus+ and other key partners from the industry and education sector have allowed for access to new audiences and stakeholders that we would not necessarily have been able to reach without these links. 

Identifying local colleges as a resource for mutual skills exchange and collaboration, has allowed us to provide opportunities for local students to engage with our research and ideas and concepts. Furthermore participating students have directly benefited from the project by developing their educational learning outcomes/portfolios i.e. onsite experience and professional mentoring.

We are expecting further direct impacts from the project as we continue to disseminate our research and engage with the local community and cultural sector.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F4F44098-2BFD-412C-A406-A4CBB8F5329A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c2cdfa6d1cb7.17075571</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main aim of the project was to expand the impact of the 2006 AHRB funded 'TRANSFER' project and its outcomes demonstrating new and innovative ways of what site-specific public art could be, where it could be located and how it could address different and unexpected audiences. This has been achieved through the development and realisation of a new time-based architectural installation at Montgomery Square, Canary Wharf, London. The work was exhibited 13-24 June 2016 as part of the London Festival of Architecture 2016 attracting a large and diverse audience.

During the course of the funded research we have been able to identify and extend our relationships with collaborators and to form new research partnerships. In working with third party collaborators we have also identified important new research resources. 

The Transfer-Impact Project has facilitated a new research partnership between the School of Arts and Cultures, Newcastle University and the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music And Dance, London. We are currently planning to continue and extend this new partnership with further joint research projects and grant applications.

As well as attracting a significant amount of financial and in kind support from both the cultural sector and the building industry the project has enabled new partnerships which have significantly contributed to the research.

Due to the nature of this project and the large-scale art installations that we have installed we have been able to develop our skills and methodologies with regards to collaborating with other educational institutions such as local Further Education Colleges.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In order to take our findings forward and be put to use by others the project needs to be fully disseminated. We anticipate this at and beyond the project completion date, through both additional publications and future exhibitions. We envisage the findings and lessons taken from the project to be absorbed and implemented in the continuing academic, practice and public debates around this research area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5B80E8FE-C907-4542-B159-E29AC547755A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2d638aa6536.96260951</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N003624/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7B8CDA14-FE2F-4F7C-BCD4-87F84927DAC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dance</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>39E7FE7A-475D-49A2-8F6F-DE29A0DC74B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Choreography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC2FB132-EBA5-4745-B339-CA9BD46FFD5C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dance Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp; Sound Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
