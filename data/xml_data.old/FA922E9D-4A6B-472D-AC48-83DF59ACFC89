&lt;p>This research will use eye-tracking techniques to assess language production in these groups by recording children's eye-movements as they describe pictures. Research with adults has revealed remarkably consistent eye-movement patterns; speakers quickly scan the scene to 'get the gist' of the event before looking at elements of the scene in the order that they are mentioned. Fluent speakers shift their gaze to the next item in the sequence before they?ve finished pronouncing the current word. Also the time spent gazing at an object reflects the time needed to access the object's name from the mental dictionary. Thus eye-movements reveal the time course of decisions about what to say and quantify the amount of effort involved in saying it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Six studies are planned in which factors contributing to decisions about what to say and factors that influence how easy it is to say it are varied. This makes it possible to pinpoint group differences in planning, organising and producing verbal language. This information will inform efforts to remediate expressive language difficulties across developmental disorders. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>328496</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to Special Interest Group in Autism</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3D95AC2-78FB-40DF-B976-8580A557EC69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented at a Special Interest Group in Autism to approximately 100 predominantly speech-language therapists.

We asked children to describe cartoon scenes (e.g. 'monkey tickling a man'). We used eye-tracking to measure how long speakers surveyed the scene before they started talking, giving us an indication of how speakers plan their utterances. We also linked what speakers said with what they were looking at, giving us an indication of how an utterance is formulated. 



We found that while reflexive eye-movements were unimpaired in all three clinical groups, children with ALI and LI were less able than peers to control volitional eye movements. Thus, deficits in oculomotor behaviour are neither universal nor specific to ASD. Furthermore, the ALI phenotype overlaps with LI in ostensibly non-verbal tasks, providing further support to the hypothesis that autism and LI share causal risk factors (Kelly, Walker &amp;amp; Norbury, Developmental Science, 2013). 



With regard to verbal descriptions, we found that children in all three clinical groups were particularly slow to articulate subject noun phrases, even when sentence frames were provided. We embedded social events in visually cluttered, but contextually relevant scenes. All children fixated items in the the background; however, children with ASD and some children with LI devoted proportionally more fixations to the background and mentioned non-core elements of the scene in verbal output more frequently than TD peers. When children with language impairment (LI and ALI), mentioned irrelevant information, core scene elements (patients or verbs) were omitted, yielding sentences that violated semantic, syntactic and pragmatic expectations. Although it is possible to redirect attention to socially relevant aspects of the scene, this was less successful for children (relative to reported attempts with adults) and did not tend to alter preferred utterances. (Norbury et al., in preparation). 



These findings suggest that children with ASD have greater difficulty determining which aspects of a visual scene are most relevant for description. This arises from a combination of reduced social interest and reduced attention/inhibitory control; deficits are most apparent in situations where there are multiple visual targets. These findings lead to a theory of language impairment in ASD that incorporates multiple risk and protective factors. One can imagine a developmental trajectory in which poor eye-movement control, coupled with reduced interest in social interaction leads to qualitatively different visual and linguistic input. Over time, this not only disrupts the ability to learn words and grammar, but also pragmatic aspects of communication.
