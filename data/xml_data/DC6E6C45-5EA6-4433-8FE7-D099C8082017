It has been noticed that the Maurer-Cartan structures appear in various branches of mathematics and theoretical physics, from characteristic classes of foliations to conformal field theory. This notion has been considered by many authors from different points of view but until now a general treatment has been lacking.The present proposal intends to lay the foundations for the theory of Maurer-Cartan elements and their moduli spaces from the standpoint of rational homotopy theory. The developed apparatus will be applied to deformation theory and graph homology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a project in pure mathematics and so immediate impact will be felt in the academic community only. The project intends to tackle the theory of Maurer-Cartan moduli spaces from the most general perspective. The subject of the proposal pervades many areas of pure mathematics and theoretical physics, such as differential and algebraic geometry, deformation theory, rational homotopy theory, category theory and conformal field theory to name just a few. Despite the fundamental nature of Maurer-Cartan moduli spaces there is a lack of a comprehensive foundational treatment of this subject; one of the aims of the present proposal is to fill this gap. It will bring together, simplify and generalize known results while making new connections which have been glimpsed in the preliminary discussions between the PI and the visiting researcher (VR). Besides laying out the foundations it is planned to apply the developed theory to more concrete problems, such as the study of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, a classical and difficult subject which has seen major breakthroughs recently thanks to ideas and intuition coming from string theory. The beneficiaries of the proposed research will be experts in homological algebra, homotopy theory and geometry as well as those working on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory and string theory. The outputs of this project will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and on the arXiv and presentations by PI and (VR) at national and international conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24220</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I014012/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
