This process laid down a new tier of monastic settlements more complex in physical, social and economic organisation than traditional forms of habitation found in the Anglo-Saxon countryside. In the absence of detailed descriptions in contemporary historical sources, only archaeology can provide an informed impression of how that complexity was given physical expression in the layout and material practices of Anglo-Saxon monastic institutions. Potential of this kind has been tested by recent archaeological work at Northumbrian institutions such as Hartlepool and Hoddom where there have been opportunities to glimpse craft activity, domestic occupation and satellite cemeteries at a considerable distance from the core monastic buildings. Although the importance of these peripheral zones is now firmly established, our conception of how they relate to the totality of a monastic landscapes remains poorly defined owing to the small scale of the excavations and the poor preservation associated with the outer precincts of documented monasteries.

This project will redress this imbalance through the detailed archaeological examination of Lyminge, Kent, the site of a documented double monastery (a mixed-sex community presided over by a royal abbess) founded in the 7th century. The site was evaluated systematically by geophysical survey and trial excavation between 2008 and 2010. This work demonstrated that Lyminge has excellent horizontal preservation covering an extensive swathe of the outer precincts of the monastic settlement, combined with an unbroken vertical sequence spanning both monastic-phase occupation and a settlement precursor of the 5th-7th centuries AD. As such, the project has potential to answer a suite of questions on the process of monastic foundation in the kingdom of Kent, a region crucial to the earliest stages of the Anglo-Saxon conversion. The proposed excavation will exploit Lyminge's potential to pioneer a new emphasis on the antecedents of monasticism in early Anglo-Saxon England, and develop an archaeological framework for elucidating the double monastery as a distinctive institutional expression of the fledgling English church.

The major activity of the research will be a programme of excavation on the village green over three summer field seasons (2012-14). The project will also re-analyze previous work in the churchyard where core buildings, including an Anglo-Saxon church, were first brought to light by Antiquarian excavations in the mid 19th century. An Integrated Archaeological Data-Base will be used to facilitate the development of the project website, archive and publications. Some post-excavation such as radiocarbon dating will be completed to enable a complete understanding of stratigraphy and site development and to inform the full analysis of artefactual and ecofactual assemblages. The main academic outputs will be an edited volume designed to set Lyminge in its international context, accompanied by articles in peer-reviewed journals. Phase 2 of this project (for which future funding will be sought in 2015) will complete full, integrated analysis of archaeological data-sets for final publication.

The project will collaborate with the Kent Archaeological Society and the Canterbury Archaeological Trust to pool expertise and also to help deliver a comprehensive programme of public outreach and participation targeting Lyminge, neighbouring communities and Kent at large. Through such means, this project will make Lyminge's heritage better understood to its own residents and enhance public understanding of Kent's formative role in the development of Anglo-Saxon monastic culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1.

How will they benefit?
National bodies and advisory groups will be able to draw upon the project as a model in how to pursue major research targets within a collaborative, community-orientated framework, an approach of direct relevance to current policy encouraging greater cohesion between regional, local and voluntary bodies and the private citizen in the exploitation of heritage assets (English Heritage 2011). The project will also benefit governmental and local authorities by providing a direct feed of data into Historical Environment Records (HERs), Local Development Frameworks, Parish and Conservation Management Plans to enhance the protection, management and promotion of Lyminge's archaeological heritage. 

Canterbury Archaeological Trust, in its capacity as the main archaeological contractor in Kent, will benefit from opportunities to adopt, through knowledge transfer, scientific methodologies used on the project, to collaborate in academic research examining a seminal, yet ill-understood era in Kent's history, to meet its strategic aim to promote advancement of public education in archaeology, and to improve its approach to the excavation and interpretation of cognate sites encountered in future projects.

The research will enhance the interpretation and public presentation of other early ecclesiastical sites represented in the region including: the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Canterbury Christ Church Cathedral, St Augustine's Abbey and St Martin's church; Reculver, Rochester; Dover; and Minster-in-Sheppey. Local and national museums will benefit from the input of new material and interpretations to enhance their exhibitions.

Project partners, the Kent Archaeological Society, along with other regional volunteer groups, will benefit from the opportunity to engage their members in an agenda-setting research excavation. Knowledge transfer will answer the Society's need for specialist training to create in-house expertise in such techniques as environmental sampling, which it can deploy on future projects. Additionally, the project's educational and outreach programme will help the Society to deliver its stated aim to stimulate the interest of young people through promoting the study of archaeology in schools. 

Schools will benefit from a variety of experiential learning environments both on-site and in the classroom tailored to the enhancement of teaching across disciplines at all levels of the curriculum; A-level students will gain valuable archaeological experience and generic skills in preparation for Higher education or the workplace; the project will promote lifelong learning through the participation of undergraduate students enrolled on Kent's part-time degree programme, volunteers and members of the public.

The project's inclusive ethos, combined with opportunities for public participation in a wide range of activities embracing varying interests and capabilities, will promote social cohesion, health and wellbeing within Lyminge and neighbouring communities. The wider public will benefit from a significant increase in a publically-accessible knowledge-base concerning a key episode in English history and the development of Christianity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>552683</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Informal contact with a network of local artists during the 2012-13 excavations seasons resulted in the appointment of Julia Groves as 'Artist in Residence' in 2014. She used the excavations, and particularly the artefacts, as a creative inspiration for her drawings. This culminated in a piece entitled 'Streams'.
 
Julia Groves explained that her creative response: &amp;quot;evokes the intermittent course of the Nailbourne from its beginnings at Lyminge down to the sea. The circles were inspired by the glass trails found on the Anglo-Saxon cone beakers. There are 43 circles each one representing a generation so the drawing reflects the time between now back to the 5th century AD. I have become interested formally in the Anglo-Saxon glass but am also interested in how the fragments seem to represent the lost narratives of the Anglo - Saxons. The pattern of the reflected watercourse in the drawing also hints at the patterns used in some brooch designs and of course the cross referencing the monastic settlement. But then the drawing does other subtle things because of the concentric circles it is quite playful with an optical illusion of slow movement like breathing which I am enjoying&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>6B13E607-030A-4178-B583-063AB9906921</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The artwork by Julia Groves inspired by the Lyminge excavations is currently on display at the Artist co-operative 'Making Art Work' Exhibition 'Response' at Maidstone Museum and Bentlif Art Gallery (8th-29th November).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54637046495726.57728591</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Artwork: Streams</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.museum.maidstone.gov.uk/exhibitions/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Filming of 2014 excavations to be included in a Digging for Britain episode to be broadcast December 2014.

These are organised and delivered in association with Canterbury Archaeology Trust Education Officer, Marion Green and site supervisor Andrew McIntosh. The workshops were very popular and inspired questions and ideas from both pupils and teachers.

Through such visits we are able to support the History programme for the Primary School, both in terms of its aims and the content to be studied.

Through such visits we are able to support the History programme for the Primary School, both in terms of its aims and the content to be studied. 
Aims include providing opportunities for pupils to learn about sources of historical knowledge, assess their value and to see how evidence is interpreted; all of this can be achieved through looking at the work of an archaeologist.
Concerning History content, there is a unit of study for Key Stage 2 pupils (7-11 year olds) called 'Britain's settlement by Anglo-Saxons and Scots' for which the input is especially pertinent and valuable; teachers can also build the Lyminge excavation work into a Local Study in the History programme.

The Lyminge Project invested heavily in making the excavations as inclusive as possible to local residents and a wider body of archaeological enthusiasts across Kent. As a result of these measures (e.g. the running of bi-weekly induction sessions to enable residents with no previous archaeological experience to take part in the excavations), we estimate that local residents and volunteers invested a total of c. 15,000 person hours over the three summer excavation campaigns. Although difficult to quantify, this engagement has had considerable positive impact on the health and well-being of participating residents. One of the key ways in which such impact can be demonstrated is in the forging of new social networks and friendships which was cited by many residents as one of the most valued outcomes of taking part in the research. Significantly, these social networks have the capacity outlive the period of the research, sustained by a common interest in Lyminge's rich past and a shared desire to create a long-term legacy for the excavations for the benefit of the whole community. 

Concurrently, various mechanisms were put in place to enable non-participating members of the public to benefit from the results of the excavations as an educational and cultural resource. This included a formal programme of outreach to local schools, an annual Open Day and weekly site tours, a touring exhibition, a special exhibition at Maidstone Museum, a public symposium jointly organised with the Kent Archaeological Society, some 15 talks to local societies and interest groups, underpinned by a sustained presence in local, national and social media and investment in a public-facing website populated with a wide variety of content for dissemination to non-academic audiences.

While the AHRC-funded phase of the Lyminge excavations formally ended in June 2015, the engagement, knowledge-transfer and intellectual curiosity stimulated by the research continues to benefit the community. Demonstrations of this sustained impact include new creative responses to the research, including a tapestry of the excavations produced by members of Lyminge Historical Society now hanging in Lyminge Methodist Church, and a lavishly illustrated 30-page booklet entitled 'Volunteering on the Archaeological Excavations in Lyminge' on sale at various outlets in the village. This momentum will be carried forward by continued partnerships between the University of Reading and Lyminge stakeholders including the co-production of a series of public display boards within the village for which funding is currently being sought.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>275785CB-E93C-4D54-9EB0-530B4E621D03</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56042c6429f6b5.13446953</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>All of the data and associated records generated by the Lyminge research excavations has been input within a centralised data management system called the Integrated Archaeological Data-Base (IADB).
