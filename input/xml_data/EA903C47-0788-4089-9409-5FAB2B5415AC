Such injuries often leave patients with persistent cognitive problems (e.g. in attention and memory) and with low mood. In addition many disorders of childhood are characterised by problems in attention and in the effective organisation of behaviour. In this programme we use basic experimental research to study attention and the organisation of behaviour in healthy people and in clinical groups. The aim is that, by better understanding normal and impaired function, we can develop better assessment tools and clinical interventions that might reduce or offset these problems. Accordingly a substantial part of the programme is in turning basic science into practical assessment and treatment tools and then evaluating their efficacy. We are working on improved assessment techniques for children and adults, cognitive training packages that can be delivered online and practical interventions that may improve mood and outcome in survivors of brain injuries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This programme investigates fundamental mechanisms of attention and cognitive control and their clinical assessment/remediation in children and adults. Current understanding of brain mechanisms that produce coherent, goal directed behaviour is limited. Basic science studies within this programme include on the construction of ?task episodes? in which control programs for upcoming activity are constructed, enacted and then dismantled. We explore the implications of this hitherto largely unrecognised phenomenon in healthy cognition and its potential relevance to disorganisation of behaviour commonly observed after brain injury including the disruptive influence of co-occurring mood problems. Basic science studies reveal elements of cognitive control that can be enacted based on information that cannot be consciously perceived. Such work is fundamental to any subsequent use of information that does not reach awareness in rehabilitation and mood remediation. Low mood and anxiety are significantly elevated after brain injury. However the mechanisms and interaction with cognitive impairment are poorly understood and little is known about the efficacy of psychological interventions in this group. Basic work examines the role played by cognitive and memory biases in maintaining low mood and the potential efficacy of ?low impact? interventions such as Behavioural Activation which make minimal demands on cognitive skills. Spatial biases are another common consequence of brain injury in which patients have reduced awareness for information on one side of space. Clinical results suggest that such biases tend to persist in the context of more general attentional impairments and in states of low arousal. This programme has considered the emergence of similar biases in children and adults as a model for understanding the relationships between spatial awareness, consciousness and alertness. Current studies examine electrophysiological correlates of these changes in attention and spatial awareness as well as the effects of online cognitive training programmes in stroke survivors and children with poor attention. The translation of our science into practical applications is a key theme within the programme, and several projects have gone from basic evaluation of new assessment and rehabilitative instruments through to their clinical release.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>11F129C7-F6D8-48CA-9CA4-9B0364BC2466</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Assisted Intention Monitoring for the Rehabilitation of Executive Impairments Following Acquired Brain Injury.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurorehabilitation and neural repair</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d09752cc2697316088d76045a8f0442"><gtr:id>7d09752cc2697316088d76045a8f0442</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gracey F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1545-9683</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7e28b49b520.23830130</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8064C669-F479-4B35-9FB0-AA1B62A1F948</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging in an experiential processing mode increases positive emotional response during recall of pleasant autobiographical memories.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Behaviour research and therapy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bb2f731c4e70c8dbc935a35c1189fc18"><gtr:id>bb2f731c4e70c8dbc935a35c1189fc18</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gadeikis D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0005-7967</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7e28b8e1538.38607371</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7416C4DC-9DAA-4E18-B2F5-59F4BD9D9D7C</gtr:id><gtr:title>When attended and conscious perception deactivates fronto-parietal regions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1cc0a75ef575c9a58c49dd209a801303"><gtr:id>1cc0a75ef575c9a58c49dd209a801303</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Farooqui AA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0010-9452</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7e18f9d7718.53198945</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_00005/10</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
