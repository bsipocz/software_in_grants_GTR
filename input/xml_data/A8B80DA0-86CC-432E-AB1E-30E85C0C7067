Due to the shortage of organs for transplantation we urgently need to: a) improve methods for selecting good quality organs; and b) identify the best medical treatments to help transplants work well long-term.
Donor insulin use as a marker of donor pancreas failure
It is imperative that organs selected for transplantation are of high quality, but current selection methods used by doctors could be improved. Selecting suboptimal organs for pancreas transplantation is partly why transplant failure rates are so high: 10-25% at 1 year and 30-60% at 5 years.
Organs are available for transplantation when an organ donor dies on intensive care. In around half these individuals, blood sugar levels rise to abnormal levels. These high sugar levels are usually treated using insulin until the organs have been transplanted. 
I studied our patients in Manchester and showed that when insulin was given to pancreas donors on intensive care, the transplanted organs produced less insulin and were more likely to fail early (8.3%) compared to when the donor was not insulin-treated (1%). This could indicate that donor insulin use is a sign that the donor pancreas is damaged and that it is less suitable for transplantation. 
I plan to use information on 50,000 people who have previously received pancreas transplants to find out whether donor insulin use helps identify those organs that fail early. I expect to show that information on donor insulin use could improve the way that doctors select organs for pancreas transplantation and improve patient outcomes.
In a laboratory-based study I will find out whether donor insulin use is a marker of death of insulin-producing cells (the beta cells of the pancreas). I will do this by using previously collected donor blood samples and by measuring DNA which leaks into the blood when beta-cells die. I will also see whether the donor insulin use is related to low levels of pancreatic function by measuring the amount of insulin produced by the donor pancreas. This study may provide laboratory-based evidence that donor insulin use is a marker of a failing pancreas.
Insulin therapy to improve outcomes in islet and pancreas transplant recipients
After islet transplantation, intensive insulin therapy in recipients with type 1 diabetes is routine with the aim of achieving normal sugar levels during the hospital admission. However, it is unknown if the degree of sugar control is related to long-term islet transplant function. I plan to use previously collected patient data from the UK islet transplant consortium and relate the level of blood sugar control over five days post-transplant to the islet transplant function three months after transplant - as assessed by the insulin response to a standard meal. If positive, the study will support short-term use of insulin in the related situation of pancreas transplantation.
In pancreas transplantation insulin therapy is not routinely given to recipients. In our experience, sugar levels are abnormal in 30% of patients immediately after pancreas transplantation - suggesting that the pancreas is not working properly and might benefit from insulin. I plan to look at the clinical and scientific evidence supporting insulin therapy after pancreas transplantation and discuss findings with a group of leading UK transplant surgeons. We will decide whether to perform a trial of insulin therapy in such patients and this will involve patient consultation. If evidence and opinion supports a trial, then I will design a feasibility study in Manchester and apply for research funding for the trial. If the evidence or opinion does not support a trial then I will lead the writing of a consensus statement that will describe best practice. This study has major potential to improve the care and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing pancreas transplantation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Pancreas and islet transplantation are highly-effective life-saving therapies in type 1 diabetes. The paucity of suitable organs for transplant and the high subsequent failure rate creates an urgent need to: a) optimise methods for selecting good-quality pancreata; and b) identify the ideal physiological environment for a transplanted pancreas to succeed.
My preliminary data show that use of insulin in pancreas donors on intensive care is associated with higher rates of subsequent pancreas transplant failure. It is unclear whether donor insulin therapy can predict transplant failure independently of a risk score used to select donors - the Pancreas Donor Risk Index (PDRI), or if it is a marker of irreversible beta-cell death. 
In islet transplant recipients, peri-transplant insulin therapy is standard of care, but the relationship between peri-transplant glucose control and subsequent transplant function is unclear. My data show that peri-transplant hyperglycaemia occurs in one third of pancreas recipients but it is unknown if insulin therapy could improve outcomes.
Objectives:
1) In a large scale registry of pancreas transplant recipients, to determine whether donor insulin use improves clinical prediction of transplant failure beyond the PDRI; 
2) In a lab-based study of pancreas donors, to describe the relationship between donor insulin therapy, and beta-cell function and death;
3) In islet transplant recipients, to relate peri-transplant glycaemic control to beta-cell function at 3 months;
4) In pancreas transplant recipients, to determine whether a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of peri-transplant insulin therapy can be justified and would be acceptable and feasible.
My Fellowship is expected to lead to better pancreas donor selection and improved patient outcomes through incorporating donor insulin use in the PDRI. It will lead either to an RCT of peri-transplant insulin therapy in pancreas recipients or a national consensus statement.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Benefits to patients
The proposed research has the following direct potential impacts
Study 1 - Positive results (anticipated from our local pilot data) will create a strong case for donor insulin use to be incorporated into the Pancreas Donor Risk Index to improve donor selection and thereby improve patient outcomes globally. Impact timeline - immediate (upon publication of results). 

Study 2 - This study will be the first to relate donor insulin therapy to donor beta-cell function and donor beta-cell death. These data are important because if positive, they will: a) explain the link between donor insulin therapy and pancreatic graft failure/dysfunction in our pilot data; and b) will offer additional support for the incorporation of donor insulin use into the Pancreas Donor Risk Index to improve donor selection. Impact timeline - immediate (upon publication of results). 

Study 2 - Development of a marker of organ quality (beta-cell death) to reflect pancreas injury in both the peri-donation and peri-transplant periods. The principal aim is to determine suitability for transplantation, although this could also provide an invaluable method of post-transplantation monitoring (both are currently lacking). Impact timeline - 5 to 10 years

Study 3 - If results show that the degree of glycaemic control is related to better post-transplant islet function then this will provide supportive evidence for the use of peri-transplant insulin therapy in pancreas transplantation. Impact timeline - 5 to 7 years
Study 4 - This study will either lead to: a) a consensus statement on the optimal use of peri-transplant insulin therapy in pancreas transplantation, or b) a grant application supporting a multi-centre RCT that will definitively resolve uncertainties about the benefits and risks of this intervention. Impact timeline - 5 to 7 years
