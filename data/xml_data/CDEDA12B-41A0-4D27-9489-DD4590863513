To achieve this it will extend the remit of the internet panel elements of the British Election Study to provide panel data in the period leading up to and after the Scottish referendum including, but not limited to, a boosted sample size for Scotland and Wales.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This proposal seeks to provide mutual benefits to the Future of Scotland/UK initiative and to the British Election Study by extending the period covered, the content and the size of the Internet panel study in England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The survey would include a full panel (including a substantial Scottish boost) in January 2014, June 2014 and September 2014 (post referendum) and would continue to include relevant follow up questions to the sample in the 2015 pre/campaign/post-election waves and then in 2016 (local elections and Scottish Elections) and finally in 2017. The proposal will link to the Future of the UK and Scotland initiative, but does not extend to Northern Ireland, as this is outside the remit of the original British Election Study award.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The BES internet panel constitutes a key research resource for wide range of users beyond academia. The data and associated scholarship serve an important role in understanding the electoral process and the health of our democracy. This will be particularly relevant in the period 2014-2017, due to declining political engagement, the implications of multi-party and multi-level governance (including the Scottish referendum) for accountability, and of economic austerity for political representation. 
Beneficiaries: Politicians and parties benefit from understanding the consequences of their policy positions and campaigns, public attitudes towards politics and reasons for vote choice and voter turnout. BES data is beneficial to political actors in Scottish and Welsh government, local government, European parliament elections, mayoral government, and to independence referendum campaigners in Scotland. BES data has international value in our proposal by enabling comparison with other countries, benefiting international observers, comparative researchers and politicians. Journalists and commentators benefit from non-partisan analysis and interpretation, and from a high-quality data source; enhancing public understanding via informed commentary. To the extent that effective policy is informed by understanding public preferences and priorities, national, regional and local government policy-makers derive benefits from the understanding of public attitudes. Policy benefits are direct on political reform and on voter registration methods. Beneficiaries also include think tanks, trade unions, commercial and third-sector organisations. Think-tanks and trade unions benefit from understanding public attitudes and political consequences. Commercial pollsters benefit from insights on question design and subsequent analysis, and from scientific capacity-building in the academic analysis of public opinion. Further benefits will accrue to third-sector organisations such as the Electoral Commission and the Hansard Society. The specified organisations will benefit from closely linked BES questionnaire priorities, from research into electoral registration and into political disengagement, accountability and representation, and from shared research goals, and dissemination activities. The enhanced BES internet panel will be of particular value to media commentators, political parties and practitioners and researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of support for Scottish independence in particular and multilevel governance and devolution more generally. 
Potential Impacts: The proposed study maximizes opportunities for impact during the four-years of the study, and is expected to achieve impact in subsequent years and elections, as policy-makers respond to the data and the research, and politicians implement changes in strategy. BES data accessibility - to any user - will ensure the longevity of potential impacts. In particular, impacts on national and devolved political party strategies and on policy-making will be maximized via the study design and via a series of additional events around the time of the referendum to be held in Edinburgh, Cardiff and London. Impact on media reporting - and on public understanding of the politics of devolution and the future of the United Kingdom will be on going, regardless of the outcome of the referendum. The collection of political focussed panel data contributes, ultimately, to the nation's wellbeing. This depends, at least in part, upon the relationship between the electorate and its political elites and on the quality of political representation; which the BES is uniquely able to assess.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>498490</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of BES Plans for Consultation at EPOP</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5A551DA-C247-4AA6-85D5-91FE02EC074C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented BES plans for consultation at EPOP Conference in Lancaster in September 2013

New research from the British Election Study reveals that last year's Scottish referendum effectively finished off Labour's hope of winning north of the border last May.

BES Co-Director Professor Ed Fieldhouse from The University of Manchester says the referendum resulted in more Yes voters switching from Labour to the SNP after the referendum.

However, the economy was still an important factor: Yes voting amongst Labour voters was driven largely by the Yes campaign's offer of an economic alternative for Scotland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff5ea2e5474.22356842</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scottish Referendum: What does it mean for England?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8CEDEFFA-B1E4-44D7-8ECE-76ED2947B0DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Featured in BBC Online Article - Scottish Referendum: What does it mean for England

However, impact from the BES has been instrumental, conceptual and capacity building by contributing to the understanding of the Scottish independence referendum by evaluating British attitudes in the referendum debate. Findings using BESIP data have been used in blog posts publicised on the BES website specifically on the Scottish referendum, Consultations (e.g the ESRC Future of UK and Scotland event on the Scottish Independence Referendum in London June 2014; PSA media briefing on the Scottish Independence Referendum in London June 2014 where Professor Fieldhouse argued it would be promises of further devolution that would sway the referendum in favour of 'No'; and a BES Consultation on shifting voting preferences in the lead up to the Scottish Independence Referendum in Edinburgh July 2014), the press (BES findings on Scottish Independence findings from wave 1 data featured in: The Herald, The Daily Record, The Scotsman June 2014, BES findings on Scottish Independence changes in voting preferences form wave 1 and wave 2 data featured in: The Financial Times, The Herald Scotland, The Scotsman, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, Daily Record, Scottish Daily Star, The Express Scotland, The Scottish Daily Mail, The Times Scotland July 2014) and tv/radio (BBC Breakfast: Scottish Independence Referendum polls, BBC Essex, BBC Shropshire, BBC Lancashire). The findings have been used to explain various aspects of the Scottish Independence referendum. 

More generally BESIP wave 1 through wave 6 and the post-election face-to-face survey have been received with huge interest by academics and other researchers working in electoral behaviour; media organisations including TV, radio, social media and newspapers; and political practitioners including political parties and campaigners. For example, Jane Green and Chris Prosser were the only academics asked to contribute to Labour's 'Learning the Lessons' review, chaired by Margaret Beckett. The BES, described as the UK's leading authority on elections, provided material central to the review, which constitutes a key part of Labour's response to defeat. The BES has been a major part of the Market Research Society and British Polling Council commissioned Inquiry into the 2015 Polls. The face-to-face BES data were the first to demonstrate that unrepresentative samples were the cause of the polling misses. The BES forms a major contribution to understanding and finding solutions for the miss, with Jane Green as a member of the inquiry and Jon Mellon and Chris Prosser's analysis of BES data being highly influential. The BES appeared almost daily in the TV, radio, social and print media around election time, the most prominent example being ITV's election night coverage which featured Jane Green who provided exclusive insights from BES data released and reported on the night. BES data was also used on Vote 2014, the BBC's coverage of the local elections, with David Dimbleby.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C7B57957-EA7B-41FA-AA0D-EC99AF2BA6A2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54648c161f4682.39088244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is primarily a resource for other researchers and we anticipate a large number of publications using the additional sample and waves of the panel study to understand the Scottish Referendum Our own research shows that the Scottish Independence referendum cost Labour a huge amount of support with pro-independence voters driven to voting for the SNP. This arose from changes in attitudes, evaluations and political identities of 'Yes' voters before, but more importantly after, the Scottish referendum.

Drawing on theories of attitudinal and behavioural inconsistency from social psychology, we argue that Labour supporters who voted 'Yes' to independence subsequently became more favourably disposed towards the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the policies that they advocated, and less favourably disposed towards Labour, ultimately resulting in a large proportion switching vote choice from Labour to the SNP. In other words, the referendum did not simply reflect Labour's problems in Scotland but further contributed to those problems, resulting in almost total annihilation in terms of Parliamentary seats.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The data are being widely used by academics, media and political researchers to understand developments in British Politics, and we have put into place a number of measures to widen access and promote usage (eg.the BES data Playground)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>51ECCAB3-F1C0-40FA-920F-E1CA2A330BD9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54648dd043ca99.47597024</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>These data represent form part of British Election Study consisting of each of the first nine waves of the Internet Panel. Waves 1-3 cover the Scottish Referendum as well as providing crucial pre-General election data across the whole of Great Britain. Waves 4-6 cover the pre-campaign period, the short campaign and post-election phases of the 2015 General Election. Wave 7-9 cover the pre/campaign and post-EU Referendum Period. The study covers electors who are eligible to vote to vote in any type of UK election (including local and European). The file contains all respondents who took any wave of the study. Around 30,000 respondents were interviewed in each wave (referred to as the full sample). We also release single Waves as standalone files for users who do not require the panel element. The most recent wave to be released (wave 9) was conducted by YouGov between 4th June 2016 and 4th July 2016. In total 30,036 respondents took wave 9, 27,555 of these also took wave 8, an overall wave on wave retention rate of 82.2%. 10,170 respondents took all of the first 9 waves of the survey, 33.6% of respondents who originally took wave 1.</gtr:description><gtr:id>21C4E641-5014-4C0C-8BB1-01081231633D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our data are being widely used by academics, media and political researchers to understand developments in British Politics, and we are putting into place a number of measures to widen access and promote usage.
