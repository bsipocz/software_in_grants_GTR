The 'Living Legacies 1914-18' WW1 Engagement Centre provides a meeting point between academics, heritage professionals, and communities, designed to capture and evaluate activities shaping the ongoing the Centenary of WW1 and engage those involved in its commemoration, while at the same time use this as an opportunity to forge closer university-community partnerships to assist a growing and important community of researchers whose interests in the past offer new insights into WW1 as well as stand as a testimony to the Centenary itself. The focus for Living Legacies is on the contemporary and continued resonances and legacies of WW1 in the UK, understanding how the war 'lives on' today, in different settings, across Britain and Ireland. 

The Living Legacies WW1 Engagement Centre specialises in areas of research that offer unique and alternative insights into both the war and its commemoration, using methods and approaches from the disciplines of archaeology, museology, social policy, creative arts, geography and history. Looking at the past through the lens of the present, Living Legacies researchers are interested especially in thinking through how commemoration is complex (1) because it is a spatial act - it takes place somewhere - and (2) because conflict heritage variously links past and present, people and places, it is inherently contested and can perpetuate past conflicts into the present-day. Far from being the same everywhere then, current commemoration of the first 'global war' is very much localised, and made distinctive, meaningful and even contentious to those involved because of the very places commemoration occurs. The significance attached to the particularity of the place in commemorative practice is becoming very evident as the Centenary of WW1 unfolds within the context of a devolved UK, across 'nations within the nation'. Spanning England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Living Legacies is exploring this theme, of WW1 commemorative practices and transnational identities, by working with partners drawn from a range of public organisations and bodies across the UK, as well as local community groups interested in WW1. This involves having a close working-relationship with community groups working on projects funded by the HLF, especially as part of the HLF &amp;quot;First World War: Then and Now&amp;quot; programme.

As a consequence of the partnerships formed by Living Legacies between community and academic researchers, the Centre aims to use a past conflict and contested heritage as a basis to build new and positive relationships across the UK, a shared future in which WW1 and its commemoration is not only better understood from different community and academic perspectives, but also creating legacies of the Centenary itself. These legacies will stand as a reminder to those in the future who wish to know how, in the 21st century, nations from across the UK looked back and remembered this most momentous of global events. To this end, Living Legacies research will result in a series of arts and humanities outputs, from scholarly works, to web-sites and digital data, to performances and exhibitions, all offering a deeper and more critical understanding of the impacts the war had on Britain and Ireland between 1914 and 1918, as well as a record of those who sought to commemorate and remember 'the war to end all wars'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The case is made by Facer and Enright (2016) to see impact more in terms of 'legacies'. The ongoing work of the 'Living Legacies 1914-18' (LL) WW1 Engagement Centre has legacies at its very core, a defining motif that is being carried forward by the Centre in 2017-19 in our second phase of outreach and engagement activity. These impacts are embedded in the Case for Support and fully set out in the accompanying Pathways to Impact document. To summarise here, the key areas of impact for LL are: 1. Building relationships, 2. Changing practices, 3. Data provision and 4. Policy engagement. 

These impacts will be achieved by LL academic and community researchers working collaboratively and in partnership on projects that are rooted in local commemorative practices during the Centenary of WW1. The wide geographical reach of LL, spanning Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and NE England, means that our co-produced research will bring benefits to a significant proportion of UK population, working with UK government agencies and departments (such as Historic Environment Division of NI's Department for Communities, Royal Commission for Ancient and Historic Monuments (Wales), Historic England, Ministry of Defence), and also UK policy shapers in the Centenary (such as Cymru'n Cofio/Wales Remembers, Northern Ireland WW1 Centenary Committee, and the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council), and major cultural institutions (such as Imperial War Museums, National Library of Wales, National Library of Scotland, and National Museums Northern Ireland). Local and regional partnerships are also very important for LL in Phase 2 as they have been in Phase 1. Together, these partnerships form the framework for LL contribution to culture and society in the UK, building relationships between communities and organisations, and using the Centenary and commemoration of WW1 to strengthen community participation and involvement in decision-making and policy, whether at the local, regional or national level.

As well as creating new networks and collaborations, a significant area of legacy targeted by LL research is to deepen community understanding of WW1 and its impacts and contemporary resonances by embedding more critical, nuanced and reflective approaches and methods. LL is achieving this by taking innovative and alternative perspectives on WW1, drawing on academic research and areas of specialisation that offer particular scope to challenge normative and dominant views of the war, and at the same time draw out from communities hidden and sometimes contested narratives and commemorative practices, to enhance community engagement with the Centenary of WW1 and its commemoration as well as securing wider public impacts as a result of projects focused on WW1 impacts and heritage. Here LL's collaboration with HLF funded community projects is key, and in 2017-19 a programme of greater HLF project support and engagement is set out in the Vision statement by the 5 Centres, including Discovery Days for HLF groups, and direct funded specialise research support from LL to connect university and community researchers more closely and productively in Phase 2. 

As a result of this closer community engagement activity over 2017-19, LL will be able to continue to build on foundations laid in Phase 1 and so yield greater benefits for our partners, scaling up activities to the mutual benefit of all. The legacies of these engagements will include a more critically- and analytically-minded body of community researchers, who once the Centenary of WW1 is over in 2018 will be better equipped and more confident to be able to develop further projects, including those relating to HLF programmes, on cognate heritage topics, particularly in their localities, and have also the capacity to work with university partners on these projects, and networks through which to achieve greater impacts and legacies themselves.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>580016</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B8AFC23A-0D0F-4E5F-B575-2B9A6D820B3F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Memory politics and material culture: Display in the memorial museum</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Memory Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dda09b86013c3f9a9f94a2880ea5e0c5"><gtr:id>dda09b86013c3f9a9f94a2880ea5e0c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crooke E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a60c2e6cfdb08.50020185</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006671/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D6754CC-B7DE-45FB-BB9D-CE7AA05892D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Historical Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
