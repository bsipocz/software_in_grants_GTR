Le Huray in the &amp;quot;Quarterly Review of the Guernsey Society&amp;quot; drew attention to a major corpus of exercise books containing what he described as the Guernseyman Thomas Martin's translations into 'Norman French, as spoken in the parish of St. Martin', of 'the four gospels, the plays of Shakespeare and the Comedies of Moliere'. The next time the exercise-books were mentioned in print (1981) it was noted that, although over 200 of these had been obtained
by the Societe Guernesiaise, the remainder of the collection had disappeared and was believed to be out of Guernsey.

Recent research I have undertaken in the Archives of Guernsey has led me to propose some revisions to these claims. The Martin manuscripts are in fact complete- the missing 206 exercise books were acquired by the Archives from a London auction house in 2003. Moreover, as far as the contents are concerned, previous accounts also need to be reassessed, for examination has revealed the manuscripts to contain a complete translation of the Bible (including the Apocrypha) and 100 plays, including the complete plays of Shakespeare (37 plays) and 63 plays from the work of the French authors Corneille, Moliere and Voltaire.

The fact that the Martin manuscripts have never formed the subject of serious academic study is probably due to a number of reasons. First, for many years, the collection was incomplete and fragmented. Second, Thomas Martin was almost certainly not an established Guernsey French writer (Census reports refer to him as, respectively, 'joiner' (1861), 'cabinet maker' (1871), 'carpenter' (1881, 1891) and then 'road surveyor' (1901)). Third, Guernesiais is an obsolescent variety which, for most of its recent history, has been considered as inferior to one of Guernsey's other linguistic varieties (Standard French and then, from the 19th century onwards, English). Indeed, since the dialect has never been used for official functions, including as the medium of education or even a subject of study at school, it is likely that few of the remaining speakers of Guernsiais would, in practice, be able to read the manuscripts.

The fact that Martin's work has only ever been mentioned in a relatively low key fashion and in publications not widely circulated outside Guernsey has meant that this substantial body of work has largely escaped the notice of the outside world, and yet its significance for Channel Island French - and, more widely, for French dialectology- is paramount. Martin's work represents the largest corpus of prose from one pen in Channel Island French and extends the corpus of extant Guernesiais writings several hundred-fold. The extensive nature of the corpus means that it affords real possibilities for some details of Guernesiais usage to be documented and codified for the first time. Given the age of its remaining native speakers, it is likely that Guernesiais will disappear forever as an everyday language within the next fifteen to twenty years. After the death of the last native speaker, the Martin Manuscripts will represent one of the most important sources of data available on the phonetics, morphosyntax and lexis of the dialect.

To the best of my knowledge, the proposed monograph would represent the only linguistic analysis of any aspect of Guernesiais writings existing to date in English or in French.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22179</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Caen University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Patrimoine linguistique et pratiques langagi&amp;egrave;res et en Normandie (University of Caen).</gtr:description><gtr:id>A550ED96-5803-45E5-BB79-4F675DD6607D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95da19cb95da1b0-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Information taken from Final Report</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Les Traductions guernesiaises de Thomas Martin: un nouveau corpus de normand insulaire</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>60D20045-5E3F-4B77-9502-025EB5C1B995</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture, University of Rennes 2

Media interest

The talk led to considerable public interest. This is demonstrated by a reception attended by over 60 members of the public (18 March 2009) to celebrate the monograph, which was hosted by the then Deputy Bailiff of Guernsey (Guernsey Press, 19 March 2009). Through this programme of dissemination, I have brought to the attention of the local community a body of work which has been described as 'an extremely important part of our linguistic heritage' whose significance can 'not be overestimated' (former Guernsey Language Support Officer, Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; Guernesiaise Press Release 2 April 2008, Guernsey Press, 15 April 2008) and 'a significant milestone in the study of Guernsey French' (Chair, Coumit&amp;eacute; d'la Culture Guern&amp;eacute;siaise, Guernsey Press, 7 April 2008).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4949794704.97909450b96dafe</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2008</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A Brand New Corpus of Guernsey Norman French</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4212CCE-0A39-4C1D-954E-34B83391D367</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Research Seminar presentation at the University of Bristol

In 2001, Census figures revealed that in Guernsey, only some 2% of the population (or 1,327 individuals) could still speak Guernsey Norman French (Guernesiais). The hitherto-unstudied Martin manuscript is the largest corpus of prose from a single pen in Channel Island French. Dating from the turn of the twentieth century, it consists of 295 exercise-books which contain a complete translation into Guernesiais of the Bible and of 100 plays from the work of Shakespeare, Longfellow, Pierre and Thomas Corneille, Moli&amp;egrave;re and Voltaire. The manuscript's extensive nature means that after the death of the last native speaker, it will represent one of the most important sources of data available on the dialect. This paper examines Martin's translation of the Gospel according to St. Mark. It investigates possible sources of the translation, the orthographic system used, lexical features such as regionalisms, the use of register and borrowings and ends by considering the way in which the translations can offer an unprecedented insight into late

nineteenth/early twentieth century Guernesiais and provide new morphosyntactic and lexical data on the dialect.

The book describes the socio-political development of Guernsey Norman French, its salient features and linguistic context, and presents the translations against the backdrop of late nineteenth-century Guernsey society. The linguistic analysis focuses on Martin's orthographic system, the way in which the translations reflect nineteenth-century Guernsey Norman french and how the corpus can provide new grammatical and lexical information about the dialect. Transcribed extracts from the translations are also included, supplemented by linguistic notes. The book will be of interest to linguists studying dialectology, translation and language contact and change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Impact on civil society has been achieved in tandem with impact on public discourse.
