Elastic impression materials are an important class of impression materials; these are applied by the dentist to the patient's mouth as a dough or paste, and accurately reproduce the fine detail of the oral structures. After some minutes, the material sets to an elastic rubber-like gel, whereupon the impression is removed from the mouth, and sent to the dental laboratory where a model is cast. Alginates are supplied to the dentist in a powder form containing other ingredients, including setting agents. The dentist mixes a measured amount of the powder with water, to give a paste, which is placed in a tray and applied to the mouth. The paste sets to a gel after some minutes. Globally alginates are one of the most frequently used elastic impression materials for taking dental impressions. They are the major material used in developing countries, due to their low cost and ease of application. Currently, all dental impression materials are supposed to be disinfected as soon as they are removed from the patient's mouth, in order to minimise the risk of transmitting infectious agents to dental personnel. However, various studies have reported that post-setting disinfection procedures are often not followed, and can compromise the dimensional stability of alginates. There is a risk of microbial cross-infection via the impression material between the patient and dental staff due to microorganisms from the patient's mouth as well as from skin, the impression powder, water contaminants and the environment. Hence, in this study novel self-disinfecting dental alginate formulations are being developed which are effective against a broad spectrum of microbes in order to address the globally recognised need for improved infection control.The main objective of the project is to develop an impression material that is self-disinfecting, non-toxic to the patient and that crucially, is low cost, thereby encouraging its use worldwide. This development will contribute significantly to reducing cross-contamination incidence and risk of infection due to the dental impression handling process from initial taking to final production of the denture.Three formulations will be developed building on earlier work with low pH alginates having anti-viral activity against the Herpes simplex virus. The formulations will be modified for the maintainance of a low pH together with the release of nitric oxide, a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent. Disinfection will be tested on impression materials contaminated with infectious agents from i) the respiratory tract and, due to global concerns of the risk posed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), a model organism for TB (Mycobacterium smegmatis) will also be included, ii) the oral cavity, iii) tap water, iv) the environment and v) skin. Viruses, bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans (the cause of oral infections such as denture stomatitis and thrush) will be used to test the antimicrobial acivity of the formulations. Tests will be performed under conditions simulating the oral cavity, by using artificial saliva and sterile human saliva, and disinfection of contaminants, both on the surface and within the impression material will be examined. To model the transit time from patient to laboratory, the killing rates for the alginates will be investigated.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will directly benefit elements from commercial, private and public sectors as well as indirectly benefiting policy makers and government agencies. Beneficiaries in the academic sector are described in the section addressing 'Relevance to Academic Beneficiaries'. The direct benefit of developing a self-disinfecting, low cost alginate impression material will be to the dental team (eg dentists, orthodontists, dental laboratory staff), who are at risk of infection due to cross-infection during the processing of dental impressions, as well as the public (patients). This is particularly so within the UK and other developed countries where an ever larger, aging population drives increasing demand for dental prostheses. From a global perspective the specific aim to produce a low cost material will help to encourage its routine use amongst the dental profession in developing and developed countries worldwide. This will address the concern articulated by the British and American Dental Associations that inadequate disinfection practices worldwide pose a serious threat to public health, through the possible transmission of infectious agents from the patient's mouth, blood and skin, as well as from the environment including the water supply. It is not difficult to appreciate that regarding the recently highlighted possibilities of infection pandemic in the modern world, the development of an impression material that has anti-viral as well as antibacterial and anti-fungal activities will be both timely and relevant. This is particularly true in developing countries, where alginates are the main elastic impression material used. Furthermore, it would save valuable time in the dental surgery, and hence reduce costs in the dental laboratory and surgery. Specific beneficiaries include all dental personnel, dental products manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and wound dressing manufacturers. PSP Dental Co. Ltd. manufacture a significant quantity of alginate per year, which is sold world-wide. In their letter of support they state that the outcome of this programme will be beneficial to manufacturers of alginates, like themselves. From a commercial perspective, development of such a material in our Department will be of obvious immediate to short term benefit to Queen Mary through intellectual property/commercial exploitation channels within the College, (ie Queen Mary Innovations Ltd, QMI), and in the longer term to manufacturers with such a huge potential demand worldwide. Much of the knowledge gained from this research could constitute valuable IPR (possibly a patent), and in this case, QMI Ltd will assist in this matter. The proposed research should indirectly benefit policy makers and government agencies in the health sector because reduced incidences of cross-infection must contribute towards reduced impacts on health care demand overall. Communication and engagement plans There are several avenues to communicate the results of our research and help maximize its exploitation. Research data will be presented at national and international dental conferences (British Society for Dental Research, BSDR and International Association for Dental Research, IADR), and published in peer-reviewed journals, after prior engagement and consultation with QMI Ltd. on protecting and commercializing our intellectual property. QMI provides a focus of knowledge transfer activity at Queen Mary and its remit is to provide support for College staff in transferring knowledge and expertise to business and the wider community. Collaboration with Professor John Oxford, Principle Scientific Director at Retroscreen Virology and Professor of Virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine and Dentistry ensures that the antiviral aspect of the proposed project benefits from his expertise in the field and the project as a whole from association with his high profile as an internationally recognized authority on infection transmission.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>365565</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MSc Thesis for MSc in Dental Technology</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>706B2ED3-0F03-4AFE-A13F-8813AA4EE3FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This Masters project resulted in some useful findings on comparing casts made from a commercial alginate and a low pH alginate material developed in this grant.

This study addressed the potential infection risk to dental technicians posed by contaminated dental impression materials between impression taking and subsequent processing in the dental laboratory and to the dental team. 

The objectives of the project, and the outcomes, are described below followed by the key findings and overall narrative.

Objectives:
i) Initially to develop formulations based on sodium, potassium and triethanolamine alginate, with antimicrobial setting pH of ~4.26 and physico-mechanical properties compatible with the requirements for producing accurate dental impressions. To progress from an earlier formulation with low pH anti-viral activity against Herpes simplex (HSV-1, see below). YES objective met.

ii) To assay the antimicrobial activities of the materials against a range of bacteria and fungi and to select formulation(s) to address Objective iii). YES objective met.

iii) To develop the selected material(s) further by incorporation of a mechanism for nitric oxide (NO) release based on acidified nitrite. These materials to be tested for physico-mechanical properties and assayed for antimicrobial activity. Yes objective met.

iv) Assaying the most suitable formulation(s) from i) and iii) for antimicrobial activity against a full panel of test micro-organisms, including potential contaminants from the raw alginate powder, oral cavity, skin and environment. A model organism for TB (Mycobacterium smegmatis) will also be included at this stage. Yes objective met.

v) Assaying antimicrobial activities under conditions simulating those found in the oral cavity through the use of organic artificial saliva and sterile human saliva. Surface microbial adherence will be measured and persistence of internalised micro-organisms examined by disruption and culture of alginate specimens. Objective partially met: in order to reflect closely the materials performance in vivo the test utilised whole stimulated unsterilised saliva. Hence the formulations were assessed more realistically for reduction in oral microbial contaminants. Also the last part of this objective was not attempted; the main antimicrobial experiments took priority over surface adhesion experiments. We considered surface associated microbes (ie those tested for killing in our experiments to be more likely to be viable than those internalised); also internalised microbes would not be able to contaminate technicians or equipment.

vi) Investigating the killing rates for the alginates (measured over several hours to model the transit time from patient to lab) by sampling replicate alginate specimens at suitable time intervals (2hrs and at 24hrs in order to mimic more closely the range of times that an impression might be stored before subsequent processing). Yes objective met.

The Key Findings can be summarised as:

? We were able to formulate experimental alginates with a range of pH profiles over their setting times. The pH decreased within the first few minutes of mixing the alginate with water, with some formulations giving an initial low pH (~4-5) which thereafter increased to pH ~7, and some formulations maintaining pH 4 after setting. The commercial materials followed a similar trend but their initial low pH was ~6-7 and final pH ~10 after setting.
? Experimental formulations that maintained a low pH (4) after setting were not compatible with casting materials (stone). However, with the inclusion of magnesium or zinc oxide, these experimental formulations were able to reproduce detail on stone casts. 
? Addition of magnesium oxide or zinc oxide in experimental formulations increased the pH of the alginates while setting, from an initial low pH, as a consequence of magnesium or zinc reacting with the fluoride (from HF), to form magnesium or zinc fluoride. 
? The hardness and dimensional stability of experimental formulations in air, water, artificial saliva and Perform ID disinfectant, at 30 minutes, were comparable to commercial materials.
? One experimental alginate formulation had a significantly higher tear strength, while four experimental formulations had similar tear strengths compared with the commercial material, Neocolloid. In general, dental impression materials should have high tear strength. However tear strength data on alginates is virtually non-existent in literature due to them not being able to be gripped in the instrument, as a consequence of having low tear strengths; this was found to be the case with some experimental formulations and Empress, a commercial alginate product. 
? The experimental alginate formulations were shown to be nontoxic in an in-vitro assay system for pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation from oral keratinocytes.
? Zinc oxide (ZnO) was incorporated into some experimental formulations due to Zinc's antibacterial properties. The experimental formulation containing ZnO improved antibacterial properties of the material at 2hrs, but there was no further improvement at killing the bacteria tested at 24hrs. 
? Inclusion of sodium nitrite and ascorbic/citric acid, to release nitric oxide (to improve antimicrobial properties), virtually killed all bacteria tested at 24hrs. 
? All the experimental formulations gave a greater reduction in bacterial species tested compared with Neocolloid commercial material.
? At 5 and 120 minutes, the experimental alginate formulations reduced virus infectivity of Hep C and 2 HIV strains, compared with the commercial material, Neocolloid, ie there was a greater reduction in virus infectivity for F1 and F1ZnO compared with Neocolloid. 
? Antibacterial killing in whole saliva demonstrated that a wider range of Gram-positive species were able to survive on the commercial material, Neocolloid, than on the test experimental alginate formulations.
? Bioglass incorporated in experimental alginate formulations resulted in an unworkable gel and therefore its inclusion in alginate formulations was discontinued. 
? 
Overall Narrative 
A number of experimental alginates were formulated ab initio by, for example: 

i) varying potassium fluorotitanate and magnesium oxide (MgO) content to reduce the pH of the set material
ii) incorporating sodium nitrite and ascorbic acid to release nitric oxide (NO) as an antimicrobial agent
iii) varying the filler (diatomaceous earth -calcined, Celite - flux calcined, bioactive glass) to improve physico-mechanical properties
iv) varying the cross-linking agent (calcium sulphate, zinc oxide, magnesium sulphate, strontium carbonate) to improve physico-mechanical properties
v) varying the alginate type (sodium, potassium and triethanolamine alginates) to optimise the physical properties. 

(NB: The sodium pyrophosphate retarding agent was kept constant).


Increasing the amount of MgO within the formulations (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%) gave a concomitant increase in pH possibly due to the removal of hydrofluoric acid (HF) via the formation of magnesium fluoride. Higher tear strengths resulted in experimental materials with increased percentage of MgO. This can be explained by the fact that magnesium ions also cross-link the alginate polymer chains (as well as the calcium ions). From the several experimental alginate formulations prepared and examined with respect to physico-mechanical properties, four (F1, F1Zn8, F1NO and F1Zn8NO), and one commercial material (Neocolloid) were selected for toxicity and antimicrobial studies.

The bacteria and yeast tested for antibacterial activity (survival on these materials) were:-
Streptococcus mutans (oral commensal - cariogenic);
Lactobacillus casei (oral commensal - cariogenic);
Staphylococcus aureus (skin and nose);
Staphylococcus epidermidis (skin);
Mycobacterium smegmatis (model organism for Mycobacterium tuberculosis);
Escherichia coli (gastrointestinal tract);
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (environmental and clinical - opportunist pathogen and a common contaminant and source of nosocomial infections);
Fusobacterium nucleatum (oral pathogen - periodontal and other infections);
Porphyromonas gingivalis (oral pathogen - periodontal disease);
Candida albicans (oral yeast causes denture stomatitis and other infections).

The anti-viral studies were conducted on the two most promising experimental materials (formations F1 and F1Zn8) and Neocolloid commercial material. The viruses tested were i) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV; 2 strains tested) and ii) Hepatitis C virus (1 strain tested).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further optimisation of the candidate materials, by an MSc/PhD student, is required in order to satisfy basic physico-mechanical requirements.
