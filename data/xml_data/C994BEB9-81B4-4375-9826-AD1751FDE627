To provide context to this question across the globe, there are an estimated 3 million neonatal deaths annually. In Uganda, with over 1.5 million live births annually, 142,000 newborn infants die every year before reaching their fifth year with 33% of these in the neonatal period. This places Uganda 153rd out of 163 countries in the global rank for frequency of neonatal deaths. Most newborn infections and deaths occur in the community, and are frequently unreported to the health sector. For example, preliminary findings from the Iganga/Mayuge Demographic Surveillance Site showed that 60% of all deaths occur outside a health facility setting and go unreported. African community studies suggest an infection rate of around 30%.

In terms of infection prevention hand washing with soap even when washed with unclean water results in a large reduction in hand contamination. A recent systematic review concluded that there was a lack quality evidence for the effect of clean birth and postnatal newborn care practices on neonatal mortality. However, the need for clean birth and postnatal care is widely accepted. A Delphi expert consensus process judged that clean birth practices at home with no skilled attendant could reduce neonatal sepsis deaths by 15% and tetanus deaths by 30%. The panel judged that postnatal newborn care practices could prevent 40% of neonatal sepsis deaths, but that more research is needed particularly on the content and quality of care during the early postnatal period.

A research priority-setting exercise by World Health Organisation (WHO) on the reduction of newborn infection deaths found that the top ranked question was 'what is the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost of different approaches to promote the home care practices especially hand washing of caregivers?' Despite this being 4 years ago, there are no registered studies addressing the use of alcohol hand gels for mothers in the neonatal period, and local experts know of no similar study. The importance of hand-washing in preventing infective deaths has led WHO to develop guidelines for hand hygiene both within health care settings and in the community and integrate hand hygiene into neonatal community care programmes. For hand hygiene, the current recommended practice at the household level is handwashing with soap. However, studies show widespread non-adherence to the household guidelines, often due to a lack of water. An alternative option could therefore be alcohol based hand gel. This is cheap ($0.6 for 60mls) and active against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including staphylococci, streptococci, and enteric Gram-negative bacteria. Although alcohol-based hand rubs effectively prevent acute diarrhoeal diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A pilot of the full study will be conducted in 10 villages around Busiu Health Centre IV and Lwangoli Health Centre III in the Mbale District of East Uganda.

Study objectives:
1. To determine the effectiveness of providing alcohol hand gel to pregnant women in rural Eastern Uganda as a way of reducing infant infective morbidity in the first 3 months of life
2. To determine the cost-effectiveness of providing alcohol hand gel to pregnant women in rural Eastern Uganda as a way of reducing early infant infections in the first 3 months of life
3. To prevent maternal infection in the first 3 months postnatally 


This BabyGel clinical trial will have multiple beneficiaries. Policy-makers nationally and internationally, local government agencies and regulators and the commercial private sector are all likely to benefit from the clinical trial outcomes.

The Department of Women's and Children's Health in the University of Liverpool is a WHO Collaborating Centre and home of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Both these facilitate rapid integration of research findings into systematic reviews, as well as having long-established mechanisms for the dissemination of research findings. This will enable the findings to diffuse rapidly to international policy makers.

If the hand-gel is effective at reducing neonatal mortality then we envisage a range of strategies for scale-up including the placement of hand gel into maternal delivery packs, antenatal distribution, postnatal distribution through village health workers, or social marketing with the production of subsidised locally available gels. 

Within Uganda itself, the research team includes members of key organisations who need to be aware of the research findings. These include: 1) experienced academic researchers in public health, maternal health and child health; 2) research training institutions (e.g. Makerere and Busitema Universities, Sanyu Africa Research Institute, Mbale Regional Referral Hospital) who will have new teaching and research tools to train researchers; 3) Government of Uganda Ministry of Health; and 3) over 7,000 research participants themselves, who will benefit from this simple self-help technique to improve maternal and neonatal health. The use of hand gel amongst participants will also spread the message directly to neighboring areas about the importance of hand hygiene, thus disseminating the hand hygiene message beyond the immediate study group. This trial will facilitate to reduce health inequity and help to develop sustainable communities throughout Mbale.

The impact summary comprises a range of initiatives aimed at:
1)Dissemination of information and outcomes at a range of levels
2)Research - capacity building
3)Local awareness raising of the importance of hand hygiene
4)Information sharing of individual components of the project

On-going Dissemination of Information and Outcomes 
There will be significant opportunities for information sharing and policy transfer throughout the project. The project will be evaluated and the development of the project as a whole and will take place on an on-going basis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150020</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>World Health Organization (WHO)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Reproductive Health and Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Research Synthesis in Reproductive Health</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C56FA53-ECFA-4792-B09C-990CF06746B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The WHO officers contribute to all the research proposals within the Sanyu Research Unit by commenting on the protocols.

Introduction 
Neonatal sepsis is a global problem causing 0.5 million deaths annually, most of which are in low-resource settings. Babies born in African rural homes without running
water or toilet facilities are especially vulnerable. Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) is widely used to prevent infection. However, it is not known whether supplying it for regular perinatal use can prevent newborn deaths in settings with limited access to running water. 
Methods A cluster trial was piloted in 10 villages in Mbale district, Eastern Uganda. Five villages were selected as intervention clusters and five as controls. Pregnant women of over 34 weeks of gestation were recruited over a 3-month period and followed-up for 3 months postnatally. Data were collected electronically on mobile phones using Open Data Kit (ODK). Women in intervention villages received a clean birthing kit (Maama Kit) along with a supply of ABHR whilst those in the control villages received the Maama kit only. Those with the ABHR were asked to use it at birth, as a single whole-body neonatal wash, on the cord stump and for 3 months postnatal hand hygiene.
Women with concerns about their babies took them to either local health centres or Mbale Regional Referral Hospital. Upon arrival, the infants were screened for sepsis using the WHO/Young Infant Clinical Signs Study Group criteria; a positive response was the study's primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were quantitative and qualitative, and included infant sepsis (physiciandefined and microbiological), infant mortality, quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), and acceptability of study and intervention. Recruitment rates and inter-cluster coefficient were also assessed.
Results 
175 pregnant women screened in the 10 villages from October to December 2015, 103 women were over 34 weeks and all agreed to participate. One woman in the intervention arm later withdrew her consent. 
93 of these have already given birth and of these, 37 infants have completed follow-up. Five infants died (14%) and 15 others self-referred with suspected infection (41%).
Follow up of all participants will be finished by April 2016 and full results will be presented at the conference.
Conclusion The trial processes for the cluster randomised trial of community distribution of ABHR to prevent infant sepsis worked efficiently and recruitment rates were excellent. The ODK online data collection functioned well and there was no loss to followup.
Final analysis of follow-up data is awaited to fully assess feasibility</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b5957ab11816.65405645</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Optimizing informed consent for participants in randomised controlled trials: a comparison of three different methods (poster presentation at the Global Women's Health Society conference)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AEA10CE0-4268-4411-8C80-D01310A47C90</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Weeks presented this poster about the BabyGel research methods research.

The women were offered patient information sheets in paper-based format, offered them as Power-Point presentations and the third option was in video format. The women were visited 48 hours after each presentation was given and interviewed about their level of understanding from what they had seen. Our results showed that the slide show consent model is the preferred model for recruitment of pregnant women into randomised controlled trials in rural Ugandan settings. Though the study was conducted on a small sample, the slide show was found to enhance communication between researchers and the potential participants.

Three posters in total from this study were presented at RCOG World Congress in 2016.
The second poster covered activity which took place prior to commencement of the main pilot study in the second work-stream. This workstream was important as it primarily involved mothers in Mbale informing the investigative team of their preferences. The women in Mbale were asked to select the optimal hand rub for use in an open, 2-arm cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing alcohol hand rub with normal hand hygiene care. This pilot is one of 3 studies being conducted in preparation for the main BabyGel cluster RCT, and will take place in villages around Mbale, Uganda. This workstream will assess whether the addition of bitterants and perfume affects the acceptability of the handgel. This will be done through a randomised cross-over study amongst mothers in the community using 3 handgel formulations: plain alcohol (no bitterant or perfume added), alcohol with added bitterant and alcohol with added perfume.
The women were asked to use each of the three optional handgels for one week at a time (with a wash out period in between weeks). After completion of testing the third hand gel the women were then asked to report on which formulation they preferred and the one which most women chose was used in the main pilot study.
