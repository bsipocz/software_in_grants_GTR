Building on the success of the MICCI project (within the Changing Water Cycle - South Asia programme) in the region, the project will address user requirements centred on understanding and managing the effects of climatological and hydrological variability and socio-economic development on delivery of critical ecosystems services, notably the irrigation water supply-hydropower generation-flood risk management nexus.
A combination of state-of-the-art modelling, field studies, satellite-based remote sensing and observation will be developed to improve the process-based understanding of Himalayan water resources availability and quality, considering meteorology, surface-water, groundwater, seasonal snow, permanent snow/ice, soil and vegetation. These stores and flows will be considered within a 'whole-system' framework that explicitly recognises their inter-dependencies and interactions.
The improved understanding will be used to set-up, calibrate and validate a robust system model of the river basins using the widely used Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) software system. This model will integrate both 'natural' catchment processes and human modifications of the river basin system into account. These latter include irrigation, hydropower generation, and inter-basin water transfers. The whole system model will be used to understand how the impact of climate change, land-use change and population growth will affect water resources (including flood risk management), water demand (irrigation and public water demand) and inter-sectoral competition for water supply (for water transfers, irrigation and hydropower) through their interactions with the hydrological cycle. The results will be used to inform decision-making and support the sustainable development of India's water resources and hence long-term socio-economic growth
The project will involve collaboration between internationally-leading scientists at 4 Indian institutions (IIT-Roorkee; NIT- Hamirpur, National Institute of Hydrology-Roorkee and the Indian Institute of Science- Bangalore), 2 UK Universities (Heriot-Watt University and Cranfield University) and one UK research institute (British Antarctic Survey). It will build on an existing and thriving collaboration between many of the UK and Indian partners. We will work with key regional and national stakeholders in India (farmers, agricultural advisers, river basin management board and the national farmers association) to ensure the relevance and impact of the research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In this project, our research will inform the understanding and management of the effects of climatological and hydrological variability and socio-economic development on delivery of critical ecosystems services, notably the irrigation water supply-hydropower generation-flood risk management nexus, in the Indian Himalayan region. It will build on the success and pre-existing stakeholder links of the MICCI project (within the Changing Water Cycle - South Asia programme) in the region. This will ensure that our activities complement and contribute to the overarching Impact and Knowledge Exchange plan of the 'Sustaining Water Resources for Food, Energy &amp;amp; Ecosystem Services in India' programme
At the strategic level, a wide range of Indian organisations at State to National level with responsibility for policy and practice in relation to water and natural resources, rural development and food security will benefit. These include the National and State Ministries of Agriculture, Rural Development, Earth Sciences, Environment and Forest and the Bkahra-Beas Management Board (who operate and regulate the supply of water and power from the Pong and Bhakra reservoirs). 
Important beneficiaries regarding the improvement in consumptive use of water are small scale, rural Indian farmers who depend on rainfed and irrigated agriculture for their livelihoods, for whom the research will contribute towards improved practices of sustainable irrigation management production that are more resilient to future environmental change. We have pre-existing stakeholder relationships from MICCI with the State Agricultural Extension Services and the All India Farmers Association.
Users involved in research to improve our understanding of how climate change interacts with the global to regional water cycle, and the consequent impacts affecting humankind and ecosystems will also benefit from the research outcomes. These include researchers on water resource modelling, rural development, aquatic ecology, surface water quality etc.
A number of activities are scheduled to achieve these impacts, including: 
(1) Network development- participating research institutions in India will profit from enhanced technical capacities through close working relations with their UK counterparts while the UK researchers benefit through new knowledge gained from interactions with their Indian counterparts; 
(2) Stakeholder engagement through creation of a multi-stakeholder platform that will link the research team and key end users in India and act as a focal point for a range of outreach and networking activities; 
(3) Workshops- we will carry out 2 workshops with farmer organizations, central and state government irrigation agencies and agricultural extension advisers at the start and end of the project. These will provide valuable opportunities for two-way learning, allowing improved understanding of climate change impact and the need to improve irrigation practices and to ensure that the research produces contextually-relevant results to maximise impact;
(4)Site visits- We propose a 3 day UK study visit for representatives of the extension services in the State Department of Agriculture in our 4 states and research collaborators, featuring a workshop and site visits to commercial irrigated agriculture facilities mainly in Eastern England. The workshop will be designed and led by RTCS Ltd; 
(5)Publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at learned conferences; and 
(6) Website- dedicated websites will be developed on the UK and Indian institutional websites on which scientific and summary outputs from the project will be mounted.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>412778</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Skype meeting to discuss Sustainable Water Resources Programme integration activities (November 11, 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8860154-DB66-4392-BD9A-BF3E1ABC2C1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A skype meeting was arranged to discuss the overall progress of all three funded project under NERC/MoES Newton-Bhaba funded programme.

Gwyn Rees (Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology)
Ana Mijic (Imperial College London)

Some of the issues and activities discussed are as follows: 

Issues 
1. Indian partner have not received funding yet. 
2. Experiencing significant delay because of not willing to share the data. 
3. NERC-MoES should discuss to solve the issue 
4. Drafting the mail about this issue and discuss further about this in water quality workshop, Delhi. 

Activities:
1. Organize joint workshop
2. Develop program webpage 
3. Setting up the video for the documentation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b83b0be488f9.10106186</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SWR programme coordination meeting at Imperial College London (January 16, 2017)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D7277CD7-10D0-4703-9DA8-5C427D98882E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On behalf of the SWR PIs, Ana updated the activities related to the programme coordination. Gwyn, Ana and myself have met on 11 Jan 2017, and discussed and agreed on the following activities we plan to take forward:

1) Programme brochure

CEH will take a lead on producing a 4 page brochure that will contain overview of the programme and presentation of individual projects with all relevant contact details. This will be used to promote the work at various events that we will be attending.

2) Website(s)

CEH will create and host a central SWR programme website, while the individual institutions (CEH, Imperial and HW) will set up the project websites and link it to the central programme site. CEH has already created the initial project page (http://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/upscape), and other two projects will follow the similar example.

3) Video

We have agreed to produce a short video material to be used for wider outreach. HW will take a lead on this. The local production company from India will be contacted to start arranging for the material collection. The idea is that the video will be produced once we have more results to present, and also after field campaigns that will provide a lot of interesting material.

4) Cross-projects workshop(s)

We are very keen to maximise the collaboration between projects, and the proposal is to organise a set of cross-theme workshops. Imperial will take a lead on summarising potential topics, and based on the interest from all three projects, the workshops will be organised to exchange information and strengthen the individual project approaches. At least two workshops are planned by the end of the programme.

5) Conferences

The proposal is to focus on promoting the work at eminent international conferences, such as EGU and AGU. In addition, we believe that there is a great opportunity for the work to be endorsed by the IAHS, and CEH has taken the initiative to explore organising a special SWR event at their General Assembly in July 2017.

In addition, we plan to organise a big international conference in India closer to the end of the programme, to bring together relevant scientists and stakeholders interested in the programme topic. The preparation for that will start immediately, with the support from our Indian partners.

Finally, Rick Stuart from EIDC has joined the meeting via conference call, and informed PIs on the requirements for the DMP.

We hope these activities are aligned with NERC expectations related to the programme coordination. We will be sending the updates on the various activities as we progress in our work. In the meantime, please let us know if there are any other suggestions/comments from the NERC side.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b956dea09490.04916531</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Skype progress meeting for SusHi-Wat (February 23, 2017)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2486A0D1-55FC-4151-A365-62D78CEEE9E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Adeloye initiated the project progress meeting through Skype on 23-02-17 at 12 30 UK time. The members attending included:
 
Bayo Adeloye, Kasiviswanathan - Heriot Watt University, UK 
Ian Holman- Cranfield University, UK 
Andrew Orr; Daniel Bannister - BAS, UK
Chandra Ojha; Hari Prassad- IIT Roorkee, India
Sanjay Jain - NIH Roorkee, India 
 
1. The discussion was started with the issue of data availability and sharing. Dr Sanjay informed that he sent two letters requesting the latest flow data from BBMB, India. However, he has the flow data including Sutlej and Beas River up to the year 2010. 
2. Dr Sanjay Jain has agreed to send flow data of three gauging stations located in Sutlej river basin including Rampur, Sunni and Kasol by next week. He also has agreed to send additional gauge station flow data of Beas river basin including Manali, Phuntar and Pandoh. 
3. The Indian team informed that they have received the funding from MoES, hence the project has been officially started this week. The process of recruiting project staffs, research fellows is just started. 
4. Dr Sanjay informed that MODIS snow cover map for Sutlej and Beas has been prepared up to the year 2014. 
5. Dr Orr's group requires more of temperature/precipitation data to validate their model as currently those data is not available. It was suggested that a formal e-mail request be sent to Dr Jain on this, which Dr Jain has agreed to act upon once received.
6. Highlights of the project progress were presented by Dr Orr and group, Prof Holman, and Prof Adeloye and Group. In general, progress has been understandably slow largely due to the non-availability of some key data (UK) and the non-release of funds by the MoES (India). These issues are hopefully now resolved and progress should henceforth pick up. Bayo Adeloye informed that unfortunately Kasi, the PDRA working with him on SusHi-Wat will be leaving the post in March to take up a permanent Faculty Position at IIT-Mandi., India. He thanked Kasi for his tremendous contributions to the project over the short period he'd worked on it. A new PDRA will commence in March sometime.
7. Bayo Adeloye updated the meeting on the activities of the steering group of the SWR Programme Integration Activities. In particular, he mentioned the recent produced publicity Brochure which he encouraged members to disseminate and share as widely as possible; and the plan for a Programme website which will link to a SusHi-Wat web site. He then stressed it to the meeting the need to take active interests in the integration activities because this aspect of the Programme implementation has been devolved by the Funders to the Project Teams. 
8. Communication: Bayo Adeloye requested that communications between members, including data sharing, should also be copied to him so that he is aware of what is going on. This is important so that he can respond holistically to issues relating to the project if the need arises.
9. Next Project meeting: This has been agreed to be over 3 days in the month of September, 2017 in the UK. Dr Orr has agreed to host the meeting at the BAS premises in Cambridge. Bayo Adeloye will circulate possible dates in due course. 
10. It has been suggested to have skype meetings in every three months. 
11. Overall, everyone appreciated the purpose of meeting and encouraged to share the information and more transparent.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b838a94d7042.63309116</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SusHi-Wat Kick-off Workshop at IIT Roorkee, India (19-21, October 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5FD68F71-6BCE-4EBD-AFDD-8823B2A74E6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of the workshop was to bring together SusHi-Wat UK and Indian collaborators to deliberate on the planned scientific and other activities for delivering a whole system model for the sustainable management of water resources in the Beas-Sultlej Basin. It featured presentations by work package leaders on modalities for carrying out the studies, summary of progress already recorded and challenges being faced. There were also presentations of a generic nature by two guest scientists. One aspect which was discussed in detail was how to move from the individual detailed process modelling into the whole system model. Issues relating to data were also discussed and as part of the efforts to get the data and also know better the BBMB, who are the main non-research parters, the investigators visited the main offices of BBMB at Chandigarh as part of the inception programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac13721e0366.36289711</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://web.sbe.hw.ac.uk/sites/sushiwat/documents/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>In including evaporation losses explicitly in reservoir simulation studies, it is often assumed that exposed reservoir area varies linearly with the reservoir storage state. However, in reality reservoir area-storage function is intrinsically non-linear. Thus any linear approximation would lead to either under/over estimation of loss in the water balance of reservoir equations. In this study, a piecewise regression model has been developed for a more accurate approximation of the non-linear function for inclusion in reservoir mass balance equation. Different models have been developed for the Pong and Bhakra reservoirs, the two main reservoir in the study area.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE2C4B22-B7C9-4FBD-998D-A5C5D166EE88</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Comparision between developed peicewise regression with simple linear regression model showed a significant reduction in the error while estimating the exposed area of reservoir at different storage levels.
