Campaigns for devolution and independence, claims for cultural, linguistic and regional autonomy, as well as disengagement from the EU and political parties in general, invite a reconsideration of the statist paradigm at the heart of modern politics. These constitutional issues are exacerbated by the crisis of capitalism and the inequalities it generates.

Anarchism is routinely dismissed in these debates: the association of anarchy with chaos and the carnivalesque travelling circus is deeply embedded in popular consciousness. Our research will transform this perception and make a concrete contribution to constitutional debates in the UK, EU and beyond. We investigate what anarchists understand by anarchy and show how their ideas establish novel benchmarks for thinking about constitutionalism. We use this analysis to rethink the status of anarchy in politics, extending insights from International Relations (IR) theory where the potential virtues of anarchy have been acknowledged, to political theory, where they have not. We deploy the idea of anarchy positively, as a model for self-government and we challenge the way that chaos is read into anarchy by its theorisation as the absence of constitutionalised order. 

The project examines the constitutions governing three national and international groups: Occupy Wall Street, the Industrial Workers of the World and the Cowley Club co-operative. Working with these groups, we hope to understand how anarchists constitutionalise and whether they are successful in realising their goals - an important first step for analysing the distinctiveness of anarchist practices more broadly. Our key question is: What constitutional principles and practices does a commitment to anarchy generate?

The work that republican political theorists have done to re-define freedom as a principle of non-domination provides a new space to integrate anarchist perspectives in mainstream politics and consider the value of its perspectives. Their idea is that being free is not just about having rights to do things, but about being protected from the arbitrary introduction of policies that disregard our interests: the introduction of a Poll Tax, for example. They believe that freedom from arbitrary rule provides the best foundation for thinking about constitutional principles in the domestic and global realm. But in deciding what constitutes arbitrary rule, republicans regulate within the state and capitalism. This is a bit like defining 'music' by the conventions developed by classical composers: jazz, rock and reggae all suffer by this standard. Anarchists also adopt an idea of freedom as non-domination but argue that these institutions structure arbitrary domination unjustly and they seek to challenge the privileges that result from them by using a commitment to anarchy to organise their associations. 

In the study of IR, the potential for anarchism to help us re-think politics in new ways has been highlighted by recent attempts to use studies of stateless tribal groups to questions our assumptions about the chaos and violence of a world without states. These writers claim that there is no reason to think that a life without the state would be 'nasty, brutish and short', as Hobbes put it. These discussions chime with work in public policy, where research shows the benefits of self-organising networks over centralised hierarchical management. Our project contributes to debates in these areas by helping us see how anarchist politics works in practice. By reconsidering the anti-anarchist assumptions at the heart of modern politics, this research will open up a critical and radical vein of thought, contributing to the ESRC's commitment to think through the foundations of a vibrant and fair society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Co-production

The transformative impact of this project is dependent on the co-production of the research project and the potential for our findings to transform thinking amongst anarchist groups around the question of constitutionalism. By influencing the way in which two key anarchist and anarchistic groups understand their constitutionalising principles, potentially changing the way they think about their practices, we will realise clear impact in the third sector. We will produce instrumental or problem-solving impact by assisting in the development of constitutional documents of these groups, and we will develop conceptual impact by enabling clarification and reflection on the principles that underpin existing practice. We plan to co-author one of the research outputs with our co-producers as well as movement publications such as pamphlets, zines, open letters. Through this process we hope to transform academic, activist and public debate around the constitutional principles and practices of the key groups. This will contribute to the strengthening and capacity-building of the activist community, based on constitutional innovation across far left activist groups. 

Historically within the EU there have been groups seeking to develop modes of democratic governance without mimicking state-like constitutional forms. Our research can speak directly to this user group. Our analysis will show how organising in our three groups mirrors that within and across left unity groups such as Syriza and Podemos, pointing to potential collaboration in the longer term. In order to extend the conceptual impact of this project on this key public policy groups, we will organise a workshop on anarchist constitutionalism in Brussels, with the committed help of Andrew Duff MEP, and Dr. Vasilis Margaras, Visiting Research Fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) and assistant to the Vice President of the European Parliament. 

Dissemination and engagement 

The wider dissemination of our results seeks to make a conceptual impact in activist communities by promoting understanding of the constitutionalising principles already adopted, but under theorised, in key groups. We will publish our findings on the websites of the UK and North American Anarchist Studies Networks, linking these to platforms such as Reddit and other social media. In order to provide opportunities to extend the benefits of the research, we will engage with activists and anarchists by organising a series of talks on anarchist constitutionalising at the London Anarchist Bookfair and the Sheffield Anarchist Bookfair. Finally, a strategy for wider public and policy impact will be pursued through public lectures at the Bristol Festival of Ideas, a talk at the Five Leaves Bookshop, Nottingham, which has a broad public audience for events and provides a contact with the Nottingham Peoples' Assembly, and a feature piece in The Guardian Comment is Free section. The aim is to transform perceptions surrounding anarchist organising, not only within anarchist communities themselves, but also in public debate. The principles that shape self-government that we will uncover can have wider practical impact in an age in which states are increasingly retreating from public roles and where arguments about devolving power are current.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199838</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>seminar presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C96BE79A-B337-4D54-A5EE-E657C0E5C4EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar presentation at the University of Sydney.

We are seeking to find out how the concept of anarchy is enacted in these organisations and to promote knowledge of constitutional theory with activists, through co-production. To date, we have completed a historical review of anarchist political theory and undertaken analysis of three Occupy camps (London, New York and Oakland) to develop a novel approach to anarchist constitutionalising. We have also forged partnerships with two horizontal organisations - the Industrial Workers of the World and Radical Routes - to discover how their decentralised federal organisations operate. Our preliminary findings are (i) that constitutionalism features strongly in anarchist political thought and that the recovery of anarchist principles offers an innovative way to re-think constitutionalising in ways that resonate with contemporary radical political practice (ii) that horizontal organisations are actively engaged in rule-making processes and their attempts to resolve internal organisational problems are usefully addressed through constitutionalising.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research promotes an idea of constitutionalising as a process, not an event. We have brought the preliminary results of our research to the attention of other communities, notably the Icelandic Constitutional Society which has been involved in a national constitutional process since 2011 in order to encourage discussions about the institutional changes that would facilitate on-going constitutional review. We are also working with new non-HEI partners to develop constitutional practices and documents that will enable other users to adopt anarchistic approaches to constitutionalising.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>34AD0A1E-823D-4657-ADDB-F97227D4E658</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58946acf7c8cc1.49623147</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://anarchyrules.info/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F50FECD8-5BBE-4727-8E7A-C39E473E6A82</gtr:id><gtr:title>Iceland's Crowd-sourced Constitution: hope for disillusioned voters everywhere</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Conversation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a85f99d77d411e696509623210e6b676"><gtr:id>a85f99d77d411e696509623210e6b676</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kinna, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58170ef6e2b3a2.19181886</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D65BF375-D765-4EEA-B299-E819CD360B07</gtr:id><gtr:title>Whiter Anarchy? freedom as non-domination</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Conversation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/abc705e2b424f3118cd9c47485085865"><gtr:id>abc705e2b424f3118cd9c47485085865</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prichard, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58170f889a79f1.60278541</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F2DEC93-7C93-43A7-B494-FA89CDE6CBD2</gtr:id><gtr:title>What the Yes Campaign can learn from Iceland, Occupy and anarchy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Commonspace</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0bc7360e505beaca1b8a2992bb12b63f"><gtr:id>0bc7360e505beaca1b8a2992bb12b63f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ruth Kinna</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58188efee7a9e3.09163466</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6AAB1A8-A796-4F64-A87C-D8CD8FF7D5EF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Anarchy in the USA: Five years on, the legacy of Occupy Wall Street and what it can teach us in the age of Trump</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/42d21dff329348a815dcb84aab66c64a"><gtr:id>42d21dff329348a815dcb84aab66c64a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kinna</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58944b93da3025.04343387</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N006860/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>468AB344-4260-4BAC-9131-DD0AAB95EACF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Relations Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
