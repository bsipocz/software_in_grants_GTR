In response to histories marked by violence and exclusion, participatory arts practices have developed as a means of survival and resistance. Lives that have been devalued have been celebrated in adversity. Identity, respect, resilience, visibility and self-esteem have been strengthened where they were most vulnerable by popular cultural traditions which draw on Brazil's unique mix of European, African and Indigenous roots. In the last 2 decades, these traditions have been re-enforced by more active initiatives that forge culture as a legitimate weapon in the fight against the forces that devastate Brazil's poorest communities. Where state provision in healthcare, education, public security and environmental protection has been most absent, the arts have been most actively engaged. \nPeople's Palace Projects [PPP], a research centre in applied arts at Queen Mary, University of London, has been developing programmes in Brazil for over a decade under the directorship of Professor Paul Heritage. With support from the AHRC, British Academy and National Lottery, PPP implemented arts-based human rights projects in Brazil's prison service for over 20,000 prisoners and guards across 12 states from 1996-2005. Projects were also established with young people who had recently left juvenile detention or deemed at risk of being in conflict with the law, within communities devastated by the impact of gun/gang crime. PPP researched, created and evaluated projects in partnership with a range of Brazilian arts and non-arts agencies including the Centre for the Theatre of the Oppressed, Grupo Cultural AfroReggae, Centre for the Study of Public Security and Citizenship, UN Latin American Institute for the study of crime and delinquency, Department of Prisons [Brazilian Ministry of Justice]. Since then, PPP has concentrated on researching how the experience and expertise learned in Brazil can be applied in related contexts in the UK. With funding from Arts Council England, PPP has worked in partnership with a range of British agencies and arts institutions to investigate how to 'translate' socially-engaged Brazilian cultural strategies into specific actions in London and Manchester. This practice-based research focused on how effective Brazilian arts-based interventions into gun/gang crime culture can be understood at a local and institutional level in the UK. A series of workshops, seminars, performances and publications have demonstrated the power and validity of the Brazilian experiences beyond their immediate context. During 3 years of research and consultation, PPP has constructed a network of partners that will enable the knowledge to be transferred to the UK in ways that reflect the lessons learned from the Brazilian research experiences. This partnership includes: Barbican Centre [Barbican Bite/Barbican Education], Bigga Fish [urban youth music/enterprise organisation], Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Theatre Royal Stratford East, Contact Theatre Manchester, Newcastle/Gateshead Initiative, Learning Trust [Hackney's education service], Shoreditch Trust [regeneration agency] and the Metropolitan Black Police Association. PPP will facilitate this multi-disciplinary partnership so that knowledge is transferred from Brazilian cultural practices to the UK, and between arts and non-arts agencies here. Under the direction of Professor Paul Heritage, the Knowledge Transfer programme of FAVELA TO THE WORLD [2009-2012] will increase capability and capacity by training and supporting a network of organisations and individual practitioners, by reaching the young people and broader audiences with whom they work, and by engaging with wider debates to enable maximum learning opportunities for communities of interest and policy making.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>369635</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Theatre Royal Stratford East</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborations and Partnerships: Favela to the World</gtr:description><gtr:id>1838162A-6F81-42F5-9A25-45D5EFE8FC9E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b959f4b6b959f4d4-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The programme was developed by PPP and CGAR in collaboration with UK partner organisations including: Cultural Warriors, Bad Taste Cru and Dance City 2009-10, Antidote 2010, Liverpool &amp;amp; Merseyside Theatres Trust, Liverpool Primary Care Trust, Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Metropolitan Police 2010, Salisbury International Arts Festival 2010-11-12 Tallinn City of Culture 2010, Contact Theatre Manchester, Lawnmowers Independent Theatre Company, The Sage Gateshead, Southbank Centre 2010, St. Paul's Way Trust School, Theatre Royal Stratford East, The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association; and with individual young people, practitioners and academics through a series of of lectures at Southbank Centre in July 2010, open workshops in April 2011 and the closing seminar for Cultural Warriors in May 2012.

1. The fellowship enabled People's Palace Projects and Grupo Cultural AfroReggae (CGAR) to deliver a four-year programme of work that experimented with and embedded favela based transformational arts practice within communities across the UK and in doing so reached over 3025 young people over the lifetime of the project. The knowledge transfer learning has also helped UK Arts and Social development organisations to re-assess and re-evaluate the future direction of community arts practice for young people affected by conflict and social exclusion in the UK. Furthermore the Fellowship has strengthened Brazilian and UK arts and social development partnerships by locating key elements of GCAR's approach to working with young people in a range of social development and arts contexts in the UK. In doing so it has raised/ reasserted some important questions and research possibilities for UK and international cultural and social development disciplines, sectors and structures.

PPP facilitated the knowledge transfer of GCAR's approach to working with young people at risk of violence in Brazilian favelas to cultural institutions and arts practitioners from a range of disciplines in the UK, The seminars and training for artists and arts organisations were an essential focus of much of the work. The impact can be seen in how arts institutions such as the SAGE Gateshead, The Lawnmowers Independent Theatre Company, Contact Theatre Manchester, Liverpool Theatres Trust working with Liverpool Primary Care Trust, and Salisbury International Arts Festival developed GCAR's model of cultural warriors and and developed cohorts of young people who will continue to develop their own skills and cascade the skills they have developed through being trained and nurtured on the Cultural Warriors programme of work. 

The impacts on the debate around the importance and role of culture in developing socially engaged young people have been located in national cultural institutions and have informed how institutions will continue to deliver social development policy alongside cultural practice. The knowledge transfer learning has helped UK Arts and Social development organisations to re-assess and re-evaluate the future direction of community arts practice for young people affected by conflict and social exclusion in the UK. 

Furthermore the Fellowship strengthened Brazilian and UK arts and social development partnerships by locating key elements of GCAR's approach to working with young people in a range of social development and arts contexts in the UK. In doing so it has raised/ reasserted some important questions and research possibilities for UK and international cultural and social development disciplines, sectors and structures. The Liverpool AfroReggae Summer Project delivered in collaboration with Liverpool &amp;amp; Merseyside Theatres Trust was a flagship project within Liverpool's Year of Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing. It was, at the time, the largest single investment by a UK Primary Care Trust in an arts/cultural project and the commissioning PCT reported back to Liverpool Theatres their satisfaction with the delivery and outcomes of the project.

Economic impact: as a result of the KT fellowship with GCAR, PPP secured further funding to deliver socially engaged arts initiatives with young people from Arts Council England and others.
* Paul Hamlyn Foundation committed a total of &amp;pound;150,000 to support &amp;quot;Cultural Warriors&amp;quot;, a youth leadership programme using AfroReggae's techniques and training to develop the skills and resilience of young creative practitioners from excluded communities in the UK as cultural leaders within those communities. This programme worked alongside the Knowledge Transfer Fellowship and increased its reach and impact..
* The existence of the Cultural Warriors training programme, which required a freelance Project Director under Paul Heritage's supervision, enabled the creation of a part time post at People's Palace Projects: Associate Director, which was sustained from 2010-2015. 
* The commitment to long-term collaboration between Paul Heritage/People's Palace Projects and Grupo Cultural AfroReggae also enabled the creation of a Collaborative Doctoral Award into GCAR's practice, jointly hosted between the two organisations, and held by Sylvan Baker from 2010-2015 resulting in a PhD. Sylvan Baker then went on to a teaching post at Central School of Speech &amp;amp; Drama.
* As part of Southbank Centre's Festival Brazil, 2010, Southbank built on a small investment of Knowledge Transfer funds in taking their Head of Creative Learning to see AfroReggae and other practitioners, programming a 3 day festival of AfroReggae's work with seminars, public workshops and performances that in turn became a further element of the Knowledge Transfer research. 
* The Lawnmowers Theatre Company created 2 professional posts and a new participation group &amp;quot;Beat This&amp;quot;, based on drumming (and therefore open to participants whose learning disability affects their verbal communication skills) to develop and build on the exchange work with GCAR under the KT fellowship. 
Santander Universities UK have sponsored 6 places per year for QMUL students to visit and work with AfroReggae for a week to ten days in Rio de Janeiro in 2015, 2016 and 2017. 

The knowledge transfer learning has also helped UK Arts and Social development organisations to re-assess and re-evaluate the future direction of community arts practice for young people affected by conflict and social exclusion in the UK
Furthermore the Fellowship has strengthened Brazilian and UK arts and social development partnerships by locating key elements of GCAR's approach to working with young people in a range of social development and arts contexts in the UK. 
In doing so it has raised/ reasserted some important questions and research possibilities for UK and international cultural and social development disciplines, sectors and structures

Key findings from the work with public agencies (including):

Liverpool Primary Care Trust
Liverpool Police
Salisbury Police
John Ivie Pupil Referral Unit
Wiltshire Virtual School

We found that by embedding Grupo Cultural AfroReggae's (GCAR) approach to social inclusion and youth participation in social development agencies supporting young people at risk of violence in the UK we have furthered their understanding and ability to be more creative and innovative in applying socially engaged arts practice in community settings

In doing so the agencies have identified the need for greater collaboration between arts practice and social development policy that promotes social inclusion for young people 

The KT collaboration has also informed the approach that public agencies will continue to take when designing services and activities that benefit young people.

Specific examples of this can be evidenced in the work GCAR undertook in Liverpool where we worked with the Liverpool &amp;amp; Merseyside Theatres Trust (Everyman &amp;amp; Playhouse Theatres), the Police, Liverpool Primary Care Trust

Similarly the collaboration between GCAR and Salisbury partners (John Ivie Pupil Referral Unit and the Wiltshire virtual school) is another key example of how the fellowship has advanced innovation in the ways the social and artistic sectors in the UK collaborate
