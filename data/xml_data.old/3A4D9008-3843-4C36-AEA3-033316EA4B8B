This has significant potential given the importance of particulate processing across many fine chemical industries including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, dyes, pigments and energetic materials.

In partnership with the US-based National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems, we propose to create the International Institute for Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing with the goal of advancing the science and technology of integrated primary and secondary continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. The aims of this project are to identify specific activities mapped onto the areas of mutual interest and start to agree forward exchanges, engage with industry and develop specific plans for joint meetings, researcher and faculty exchanges, collaborative research, and training activities that will benefit the wider community in both collaborating countries. In addition, the scope of a Mock Submission, the regulatory process by which new drugs are approved for use, will be developed by engaging jointly with UK/EU and US regulators and industry to agree on the framework that would ensure the impact of academic contributions on addressing the regulatory challenges for the adoption of continuous manufacturing. 

The proposed links with international experts will lead to accelerated progress of integrating continuous manufacturing processes into the high value chemical sector, raise profile of UK-based research, and ultimately enhance the opportunities for high quality, collaborative research outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries from the research engagement proposed in this application will be the personnel in each of the respective Centres forming the International Institute. They will benefit from increased exposure and increased level of engagement with a view to driving forth their own research ideas as part of larger global mission to transform the current practises of pharmaceutical manufacture. Ultimately who will benefit from this Institute is the international pharmaceutical manufacturing sector and regulatory bodies. Therefore the beneficiaries will range from who is directly involved in the institute to those who are associated with the research outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>248174</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems (C-SOPS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>International Institute of Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing - Research Workstrand</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B02164E-636D-48B7-8222-DD6105F694E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research is currently ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd4f4f92dd42.07057157-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>C-SOPS will perform characterisation tests on the paracetamol batches mentioned above.
