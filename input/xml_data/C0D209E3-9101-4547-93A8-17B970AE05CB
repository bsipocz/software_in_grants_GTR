context?</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K003771/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Domestic burglary is a high volume crime affecting many households. As well as substantial financial loss and damage to property, it causes high levels of anxiety about the possibility of being burgled. Surveys documenting public priorities about crime place burglary at the top. Burglar alarms and other security devices in principle deter potential burglars. Insurance premiums are discounted when a fully operating burglar alarm exists in the home due to claims about the effectiveness of burglar alarms and other security devices in the marketing literature, but no systematic research studies have been undertaken to assess their effectiveness in different areas, accommodation types and occupants' characteristics. The research proposed is precisely concerned with such an assessment. The primary research question is: Which burglary security devices work for whom and in what context?

This study will identify the individual and combined security devices that offer cost-effective burglary protection to (a) the population in England and Wales overall; (b) specific population subgroups according to their socio-economic attributes; (c) the residents of Wales, each of the nine English regions and area types according to population socio-demographic profile and density; and (d) area types and population subgroups plausible combinations. 

The urgency to gain insights about the cost-effectiveness of burglary devices for tailor-made preventive interventions cannot be exaggerated: at a time of massive public spending cuts and declining disposable incomes the latest Home Office figures show a 14% annual increase in domestic burglary in 2010/11 after an extended (fifteen years) period of falls (Chaplin et al. 2011). The Department for Communities and Local Government (2012) has recently highlighted the need of research evidence on cost-effective burglary security devices to inform the on-going deliberation on national building regulation for minimum standards for security in homes.

The proposed research will: 
-Make a major scientific contribution with immediate and high societal and economic impact. Its theoretical and methodological advancements will inform future research developments in criminology. The current gap in knowledge impedes cost-effective burglary prevention not just in the UK but across the world at a time that wasteful financial decisions are unaffordable. 
-Engage throughout with high level research users in the public sector and civil society organisations and inform national and international guidelines on burglary prevention. The research results will be regularly conveyed to users in the private sector (the security and insurance industry) who however will not contribute to their development to avoid conflict of interest. 
-Analyse two decades of a formidable existing data source, the British Crime Survey (BCS). The BCS is a large and complex dataset with currently some 40,000 respondents annually that exists in the public domain, and has been run for three decades. Yet, relative to both data generation cost and its impeccable quality, it has been extremely under-explored. 
-Employ innovative research techniques for the deeper exploitation of the BCS, including the Security Impact Assessment Tool, pioneered by the co-applicants with ESRC support to assess the effectiveness of car security devices, as well as the multivariate multilevel logit modelling, to investigate the effect of context on trends of related crime types. 
-Build the national skills base in the analysis of large and complex datasets and expand the limited secondary data analysis capacity in criminology via actively seeking to employ a full time researcher from disciplines (mathematics, statistics, sciences or engineering) beyond traditional BCS users.

Therefore the proposed research fits the ESRC-SDAI call specification. The co-applicants' theoretical, methodological and policy contribution to date ensure its successful delivery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Burglary has both financial and intangible costs to individuals, local communities and society in general. Costs include, for example, immediate losses, damage to property, distress and days lost from work. This research has been designed to inform future policy guidelines in ways that could lead to considerable financial savings and produce direct benefits to the following groups: 
- Local authorities as housing providers and as responsible members of Crime Reduction Partnerships, working more effectively and efficiently to discharge their responsibilities 
- Private and housing association landlords, working more effectively and efficiently to improve security of tenants 
- Victims and repeat victims of burglary, by informing them of how best to reduce their future risks
- All households, by informing them of cost effective security investments
- The insurance industry, by enabling them to offer incentives for households who actively seek to reduce their risk by taking effective security measures; 
- The security industry, by enabling them to improve products and better target them according to clients' socio-economic and area profiles
- Public information by suggesting improvements to the household security questions of the Crime Prevention Module of the British Crime Survey; and 
- Public policy by informing the Department for Communities and Local Government on minimum standards for home security. 

In an indirect way the proposed research will also benefit: 
- The police, by reducing workloads (and thus costs) through reduced burglary and by enabling more informed advice to be given to community members on general and burglary victims in particular
- The society at large, by reducing burglary and its impact; 
- The economy, via increased tax revenues (from the decline of illegal markets due to weak stolen products' supplies). 

Public engagement at the start-up, intermediate and final stages of the proposed research has been planned to maximise its impact to all research users groups (see Pathways to Impact). In addition users from the public and voluntary sectors will be actively involved in the development of the research throughout its duration via the work of high ranking representatives who have agreed to participate in the Advisory Committee (see Pathways to Impact, Case for Support and Project Partners). 

Criminology is currently undersupplied with trained secondary data analysts. This is a particular problem: there is a wealth of existing large and complex datasets. Their deeper examination would offer invaluable theoretical insights and assist crime prevention and criminal justice policy. An important outcome from our research will be to increase that capacity within criminology via employing an RA from another discipline and training her /him to undertake secondary data and advanced statistical analyses on the British Crime Survey data. 

As seen in their respective CVs members of the research team already enjoy close contacts with and serve in bodies responsible for crime measurement and prevention. They are thus accustomed to communicating findings to non-specialists in ways that draw out their policy and practice significance. Past work has already had a substantial impact. For example, Farrell's work on repeat victimisation has found its way into routine policy and practice. Grove's recent work on heritage crime has received substantial media coverage. Tseloni's work has played a pivotal part in official reports of crime statistics and patterns. Tilley wrote the original guidance for analysis for the Crime and Disorder Act (Hough and Tilley 1998) and his work on problem-oriented policing and partnership has likewise had a substantial impact on the work of local police services and partnerships.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>123657</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Northampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>EMPAC Local and Community Policing Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>EB5EB430-FA58-4E39-B5BD-5A5F52A5F566</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A list of conference presentations and research reports on:

Please refer to the Impact Narrative of the first part of the project, ES/K003771/1, for a detailed list of the public and voluntary sector organisations which contributed to the project via their participation in the AC. 

In addition to the Advisory Committee of Stakeholders and Experts the project team employed the following collaborative and engagement mechanisms:

? Presenting findings in (non-academic) practitioners/policy conferences, such as National Neighbourhood and Home Watch Stakeholders Event 2014; The WHO and University of Cambridge Global Violence Reduction Conference 2014; the Home Office International and Policing Conference 2015; the College of Policing Research Showcase and elsewhere;
? Briefing Notes, Summary Reports and Press Releases;
? Project website updated with latest news, Briefing Notes and Summary Reports; 
? Blog and Twitter accounts for continuous postings/opinion exchanges; 
? Radio/TV interviews, newspaper postings, articles in practitioners newsletters and magazines;
? Participation in Local Crime and Safety Partnerships Board meetings; and
? One-day end of project non-academic conference (21.1.2015), including the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Paddy Tipping, and Chief Supt Alex Murray, West Midlands Police and Founder and Chair of the Society of Evidence-Based Policing as speakers, as detailed in the Impact Narrative of the first part of the project (ES/K003771/1) and the project's website: http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/socialsciences/research/projects/burglarysecurity/. 


Details of the above activities can be found in the Portfolio Section on Researchfish. 

The research increased the effectiveness of public services and policy via cost - effective crime prevention and enhanced the quality of life via crime and fear of crime reduction. It also indirectly contributed to the economy via data and methodological improvements in measuring security and its effectiveness for informed burglary prevention investments, improved economic performance of the security industry and evidence-based domestic property insurance incentives.

Additional (to what has already been outlined in the Impact Narrative for the first part of the project ES/K003771/1) societal and economic impact generated from the research to date is given below.

The Home Office included 'Opportunity/security as a driver of crime'. It produced a Discussion paper (January 2015) with the above title which was available in hard copy at the Home Office International and Policing Conference 2015. The paper which focusses on the security hypothesis for the crime falls, put forward by the PI and two of the CIs in their earlier ESRC-funded project, invited policy debates including a response by the project's international CI. The following month (February 2015) the Australian Institute of Criminology published a Trends &amp;amp; Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice (No 495) report confirming the major role of security for the crime drop based on offenders interviews. Therefore the security hypothesis already influences debates and policies at national level. 

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) made changes to the 2015/16 Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) following two of the project's suggestions allowing in future measuring whether people had double glazed windows, whether burglary victims with an alarm did or did not have it switched on and whether it was activated at the time of the incident. Additional changes following the project's recommendations may be considered for the 2016/17 CSEW. 

More practical use of the research findings (impact) is expected as the Home Office, police forces and local councils will become more aware of the research findings and from disseminating the NCDP pilot evaluation results in due time.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>21928E30-D598-4A5F-98EE-69C656A0C822</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463d0382d3183.37284268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The second part of the research undertaken at Loughborough University produced significant new knowledge by further exploring the unexpected result with regards to alarms' ineffectiveness against domestic burglaries; identifying the population groups and areas types within England and Wales with above average burglary risks and below average availability of effective security from 1992 to 2011/12; and confirming the security hypothesis for the burglary falls. In particular, from 1998 burglar alarms conferred a net loss in burglary protection with respect to most security combinations to which they were added. However in 1992-1996 alarms protected effectively against burglary. This inconsistency over time may be due to: generalised use of poor quality alarm systems, alarms flagging valuables in the home, offenders' adaptation, and drowned out effects from police's and the neighbours' delayed or lack of reaction to activated alarms in recent years. 

The research provided findings on the types of population groups and area types at most risk of burglary and with the least presence of security devices. The following population groups are consistently over time, and especially after the burglary fall, at a greater risk of burglary and have lower levels of effective security than others: 

? Social or private renters
? One or three or more adult households, those with children or Lone parents
? Households of Asian (Indian-sub-continent), Chinese or other origin
? Households on low (&amp;lt;&amp;pound;10,000) or non-reported annual household income
? Households without a car
? Households living in deprived areas

Crime prevention initiatives should support the above households and communities to improve their burglary security.

Lastly, analyses of burglars' modus operandi over time confirmed the relevance of security measures to burglary reductions. This draws upon and extends the 'security hypothesis' developed in earlier ESRC-funded work by the PI and two of CIs of this project. The hypothesis sits within the framework of crime opportunity theory and routine activity theory. 

This analysis developed new methodology in three ways: First, it expanded the SIAT developed by the PI and two CIs of the current team in an earlier ESRC-funded project to obtain the 'Marginal Security Protection Factor' (MSPF's). These measure whether a particular device is an effective addition to security combinations, increasing the overall protection conferenced. Second it employed Bivariate Multilevel Logit Modelling (BMLM), an innovative use within criminology of an advanced statistical methodology introduced by the PI in her past research, to test here the relationship between security and burglary, taking into account population group composition. Finally it developed a new methodology, Contextualised Security Impact Assessment Tool (CSIAT), for gauging the effectiveness of security across population groups and areas. 

Training the Research Staff in the above new methodologies developed new skills and capability. 

The findings opened up new research questions: Why households with similarly low levels of effective security are to a different extent at high risk of burglary relatively to those well-secured? Could additional to security availability factors, such as collective efficacy and/ or spatial distance from pools of potential offenders, explain these differences? Have acquisitive crime reductions precipitated the falls in violence?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As outlined with regards to ES/K003771/1, the findings can inform:

In addition the University of Nottingham established requirements for the privately rented student accommodation to be WIDE secured immediately after hearing the project's findings during the target hardening pilot planning discussions at the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership Board meetings by the PI. 
The Nottinghamshire Police Force and the Nottingham City Council launched a burglary target hardening campaign, via the Nottingham City Transport Bus Advertising (on certain routes) the project's finding that door and window locks, external and internal lights offer the most efficient protection against burglars. Neighbouring cities, for example Leicester, have undertaken the same initiative. 
The above regulations and publicity would reduce burglaries in Nottingham and Leicester overall and especially against Nottingham's private renters and students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5559d5ba836d73.56932262</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of

This consisted of: 
(a) the Security Impact Assessment Tool (SIAT), a new methodology developed by three of the co-applicants in their earlier ESRC-funded project and expanded here for testing Marginal security effects; and
(b) Contextualised Security Impact Assessment Tool (CSIAT), a new methodology developed in this research for testing the effectiveness of security across population groups and areas expanding the SIAT via incorporating Bivariate Multilevel Logit Modelling results. This is an innovative within criminology advanced statistical methodology introduced by the PI in her past research, testing here the relationship between security and burglary. 
If security does not protect from burglary, then the distribution of security devices, including none, would be the same between burgled households and the general population. The SIAT produces 'Security Protection Factors' (SPF's = the odds ratio of burglary risk within households without security with respect to burglary risk within households with security) which measure the protective effect of security. The absence or presence of security for burglary victims was measured at the time of burglary whereas for others at the time of the interview. As an extension, calculating the effect from the absence of a particular device across different security combinations produces the 'Marginal Security Protection Factor' (MSPF's) for that device. This is a new methodological development testing whether individual devices are important additions to security combinations. 
The SIAT allows ascertaining the overall and marginal effectiveness of security but overlooks group composition. For example, the profile of households and properties with door and window locks differs from that of households with security chains and window bars. To overcome this we employed BMLM. In the context of this project, the term Bivariate refers to two (dependent) variables which are related due to being affected by similar household and area characteristics. The term Multilevel refers to clustered units of analysis: households nested within areas. Logit is the statistical specification required to model binary variables, such as burglary risk and security presence, which have only two possible values: yes/ no. Therefore the BMLM is the perfect methodology for addressing exactly the central research question of this project: the population groups for whom and the contexts within which security works. Estimating the burglary risk and security presence across population groups, area types and regions of England and Wales via BMLM, showed for whom and where security is most lacking and burglary is most prevalent. It also showed how much burglary risk and security are correlated between households and between areas, with and without accounting for group composition. 
The CSIAT, the methodology developed during this project, entails calculating the SPF's of security combinations based on the population group- and area- specific burglary and security odds ratios which are estimated via BMLM. Thus the population groups and contexts for which lack of security is associated with the highest burglary risk can be identified. In other words, the CSIAT reveals the population groups and areas which would benefit most from home security improvements.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE6C187E-3AC0-4B9A-957E-D1E8B3BB3F56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The new methodological development can be used to (a) test whether individual devices are important additions to security combinations and focus on specific population groups and area types.
