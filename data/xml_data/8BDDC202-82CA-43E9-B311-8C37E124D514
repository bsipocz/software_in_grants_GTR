Academic writing practices of various kinds (scholarly, pedagogic, and 'impact' writing) are central to the enterprise of higher education. It is largely through these writing practices that universities achieve their central objectives, against which the success of different institutions is measured. Available digital resources, increased managerialism and the internationalization of higher education are reorganizing the socio-material contexts within which academics carry out their writing work. 

This study aims to inform future innovation, productivity and teacher training in HE through a better understanding the dynamics of these interconnected processes. The study will inform ideas about how the mission of the university sector can best be supported and developed in challenging times, when demands for greater accountability, increasing numbers of students, resourcing decisions, technologies and changes in the understanding of academics' roles are transforming the work of professionals in higher education. 

The writing practices of academic staff in nine disciplinary sites will be followed over a year, through a combination of interviews, close ethnographic observation of both online and offline writing activities, and analysis of the wider organizational context. These methods will generate a multi-modal data set which will be analysed through the theoretical lenses of literacy studies and social material theory. 

Literacy studies draws attention to how participants perform everyday tasks and enact &amp;quot;being an academic&amp;quot; in organizational settings. They link methodologically with studies of everyday practice and involve the close observation of textually-mediated interactions. Socio-material theory articulates the importance of both people and material artefacts in networks of activity. This approach identifies the trajectories of texts, how they circulate and co-ordinate activities across multiple sites; and reveals the underlying physical and information architecture of contemporary practices.

Combining these approaches will lead us to analyse elements of the everyday experience and activities of participants including: social networks and relationships; the purposes for academic writing and the location of these within the dynamics of other competing purposes and types of writing; resources and tools including digital and other technologies and library/learning resources; the distribution of academic activities across space and time; and disciplinary and institutional domains including activities of research, teaching, administration, consultancy and service.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who are the beneficiaries? 
Viewing the university as a workplace, the beneficiaries will be all those involved in the production of writing. This includes academics, those in management roles and other support staff. People in management roles include heads of departments, human resources staff and central university management. Other support staff include departmental administrative staff (or equivalent), IT staff, learning technology staff and information management staff.
Academics across all disciplines and types of university are potential beneficiaries. This covers academics in British universities as well as international universities where there is a focus on writing, and often, specifically academic writing in English. Research students training to be academics are also beneficiaries. 
Related professionals in national agencies and intermediary networks include the Higher Education Academy, Research Councils and government departments, ESRC-Doctoral Training Centre Directors, UCU and trade union learning reps., Equality Challenge Unit and disciplinary professional associations. Representatives will be invited to our online advisory group and to our final symposium.
Looking beyond the university sector, professional workers in other sectors where there is extensive writing and demands are changing are also beneficiaries. This includes public sector, private sector and third sector professionals.

How will they benefit? 
Professionals will benefit by being better able to manage work demands in a rapidly changing environment. Better implementation of change can be achieved and they can benefit from innovations in knowledge production. Training for academic and professional writing can be improved and the mentoring of early career professionals can be strengthened. This has the potential to enhance the health and quality of life of all involved and to improve creative output. It can increase the effectiveness of the university sector nationally and globally. 

What is the timescale for impact? 
By beginning impact alongside data collection in the sites, there can be local impact from the beginning of data collection. Over time we provide steps for this to move out to the institution as a whole and beyond. There will also be focused impact activities at the end of the project. Longer term impact on professional culture more broadly can be achieved through our collaboration with The Work Foundation which is part of Lancaster University. The symposium at The Work Foundation in Westminster will reach the national level and will enable a longer term dialogue with policy makers and other professionals beyond higher education. 

What skills will project staff develop? 
The researchers will be trained in interviewing, coding and fieldwork, using new technologies and newly developed methodologies. They will generate multimodal data and be trained in new data management and archiving skills. They will be supported to contribute to high impact publications and to develop their media presence, including the use of online social media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>371369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Helsinki</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Finland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Modern Languages</gtr:department><gtr:description>Lancaster-Helsinki academic writing network</gtr:description><gtr:id>C982365C-FD55-43BF-8FBC-DE1EC3306590</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Symposium presented at Sociolinguistics Symposium 2016 on 'Regimes of academic writing'.

Much of this has been around the concept of supporting people in setting boundaries around particular types of writing. Locally, the Linguistics and English Language department at Lancaster University has changed several workplace practices, in part as a result of discussions about and events organised by the project. Cut-off times have been set around work emails to enable staff to maintain email boundaries. Writing retreats have been introduced both for staff (as the annual research awayday) and for students (as part of the MA dissertation support course). Participants on our project writing retreat have also taken back the practice of writing retreat to their own departments. We continue to be invited to engage with audiences in Higher Education institutions sharing our findings, and supporting discussion of strategies that individuals and institutions can adopt in order to support academics' workplace writing. Our recent workshop at Northumbria University, for instance, has immediately led to a plan for discussions with management about developing a more structured approach to supporting academics' writing, and making expectations about digital communications practices more explicit. When we present and discuss this research, audiences immediately engage with implications for their own institutional setting. The impications for each context may be different, and we do not seek to impose a single model of best practice in academic writing on the basis of this research; rather, we enable people to think differently about their individual practices and about changing institutional contexts, opening up conversations which we hope will continue.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>03DE7041-61C5-47A1-A730-EB62387F64E2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56defe8265e887.30788690</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project studied academics' writing practices, and how they related to changes in the broader context of Higher Education in England. We focused in particular on &amp;quot;socio-material&amp;quot; aspects of academics' working lives, that is, space, time, collaborations and other material resources; digital communications technologies; managerial practices; and changes in academic scholarly and professional identities.

Key findings include:

? Space and time.

Academics' working days are often fragmented, with multiple, often conflicting writing demands, operating at different timescales. When working at the university, physical interruptions are commonplace, and university working spaces are not usually designed with academics' writing needs in mind. Academics expend a great deal of energy triaging tasks associated with their many different roles and managing the minutiae of daily writing. 

In order to manage these writing demands, academics attempt to set boundaries around different types of writing, and to protect themselves from interruption. Strategies for setting boundaries include working on different kinds of writing in different spaces, and time blocking different kinds of tasks. Many also extend writing work across different times and spaces, facilitated by digital communications technologies. 

Most participants in the study wrote extensively at home as well as at the university workplace, and this was particularly the case in relation to research-based and scholarly writing. This could become problematic, where a clear distinction was not made between work and non-work times and spaces.

? Digital technologies.

Participants expressed strong feelings around digital technologies. Dealing with a constant influx of emails, in particular, was a feature of the work life of all of our participants. Almost all of our participants accessed emails using some kind of portable device, whether a laptop or, for most, a smartphone. Some managed the constant influx of email through, again, setting boundaries, whether setting boundaries in time and space around email, or removing access to ubiquitous electronic devices at particular times of day. Academics' institutions and departments did not have explicit approaches to email communication which made expectations around email writing explicit or manageable. 

Social media was an area which generated polarised responses. There are now much greater possibilities for academics to have a social media presence, whether on academic media like academia.edu, or more generally public media like Twitter or Facebook. This represents positive possibilities for engaging with wider audiences, but is also associated with risks, both of more public exposure, and of increased workload.

? Relationships and collaboration.

Relationships and collaboration across extended times and spaces were facilitated by digital media, but digital communication was rarely felt to be enough for building and maintaining productive research relationships. 

Relationships were also important in terms of learning how to be an academic and how to manage diverse writing demands. 

? Managerial practices

The Research Evaluation Framework (REF) and associated institutional strategies around research-based and scholarly writing were very significant factors for academics when they spoke about their writing. The different disciplines that we worked with were associated with different highly-valued writing genres. The REF, other metrics, and institutional managerial strategies did not reflect this diversity, causing tension and concern.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have significance for those involved in supporting and training early-career researchers (as evidenced by the invitations our project has already received from research development staff). They also have significance for higher education management, particularly at the level of the provision of training and support for Heads of Department, who play a crucial mediating role between institutional policy and academic staff. More broadly, there are implications for knowledge work more generally, and we are currently planning an online course to support people in knowledge-intensive jobs in reflecting on their writing practices and how they deal with multiple streams of information flow while still maintaining time and space for deeper, more reflective work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F78A9BB2-D1B8-457C-ABDF-4506A5193DFF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56defe61ca8698.37987479</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/acadswriting/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C8906C0-0C19-45FA-8DD5-24222B02F2A3</gtr:id><gtr:title>What annoys you about technology at work?
