Having experience with Lagrangian and Eulerian models of differing complexity and resolution, I understand that there are many different types of modelling tools, which are each useful for tackling different problems. 

I currently use a global chemical transport model (pTOMCAT) to investigate the role of nighttime oxidation in the UK region and globally, as part of the NERC-funded project RONOCO (Role Of Nighttime chemistry in controlling the Oxidising Capacity of the atmosphere). This project has combined aircraft measurements from around the UK (focusing on pollution plumes from major cities) with various chemical models, with the aim of understanding the contribution of nighttime oxidation. During my PhD, I used the Lagrangian photochemical model CiTTyCAT to study the different processes influencing the secondary pollutant ozone, in particular during inter-continental transport. I am currently also using the Met Office?s dispersion model, NAME, to investigate Arctic methane emissions sources. This is part of the MAMM (Methane in the Arctic: Measurements and Modelling) project, in which I have a role in flight planning, running NAME, and as the knowledge exchange (KE) contact. I am working with the British Antarctic Survey, who are co-ordinating the KE for NERC?s Arctic Research Programme (of which MAMM is a part). 

I have a keen interest in politics, and firmly believe in evidence-based policy. It is clear that in the field of air quality and the environment, science has an important role to play in informing policy. I also appreciate that despite the limitations of our scientific understanding, policy decisions must be made based on the best evidence available. Therefore, understanding the context and communicating the salient points of any research is essential. This became clear to me when I worked at the Institute of Physics as a unications officer. My role required me to read scientific papers and write press releases highlighting the wider importance of physics research. I also wrote press releases about the policy position of the Institute of Physics, for example in relation to science education, or responses to government consultations. 

As one of four main mission scientists, during the RONOCO field campaign (July 2010 and January 2011)I was part of a team responsible for planning and running flights on the UK research aircraft, which was based at East Midlands Airport for the field work. This role required assessing weather and air quality forecast information, and deciding where to fly to best meet our scientific and logistical needs. We worked well as a team, with one scientist taking responsibility for the final planning and running of each flight. This involved keeping all the instrument scientists (approximately 15 people) informed about the status of the flights, liaising with the pilots to plan the flights, and making decisions during the flight itself. I feel that I responded well to the extreme time-pressure and intensive working period, and really enjoyed working with so many different people (scientists, pilots, engineers, flight managers, Met Office weather forecasters) and juggling the different priorities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39358</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>During my fellowship, I provided written recommendations to Defra regarding their air quality modelling activities.
