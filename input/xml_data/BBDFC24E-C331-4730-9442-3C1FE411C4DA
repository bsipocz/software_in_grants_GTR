Cottage industries across the entire region of South Asia are considered beneficial both for economic growth and as accessible means to alleviate rural poverty. The Malay Government has invested significantly over recent decades to revitalise weaving practices such as songket textiles. However, there has been limited success since these initiatives have adopted a traditional product-centric business model and made limited use of digital technologies.

In this project we will engage in ground-breaking interdisciplinary research to promote sustainable economic development and welfare in Malaysia by radically changing the business models of cottage industries. The project will explore more sustainable and innovative business models flexible to integrate cutting-edge technologies that place customers at the centre of personalised production. We propose the design of digital applications which could be built upon distributed ledger technology for the management of the demand chain. These in turn will be able to support the hand-making of unique individual artefacts rather than mass-production commodities.

The Digital Threads project has the potential for significant economic and social contributions. We draw expertise from HCI, computer science, and information management to deliver: 
(i) new knowledge about the cottage industries and their decentralised handmade modes of production;
(ii) innovative customer-centric business models for the management of the demand chain; and 
(iii) novel designs of digital technologies for shaping these business models through fresh approaches to designing for provenance. Such approaches will enable the transparency of the hand-making process, the maker's experience, and the value of cultural heritage embedded in it. 

These outcomes have the potential to bring the Malay cottage industries into the 21st century and its worldwide Digital Economy whilst honouring and leveraging their cultural heritage. They will also leverage the less explored potential of blockchain technologies for social impact and for addressing the global challenge of poverty.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Digital Threads project has the potential for strong economic and social contributions across several communities. It will generate (i) new knowledge about the cottage industries and their decentralised handmade modes of production, (ii) innovative customer-centric business models for the management of the demand chain, and (iii) designs of new cutting-edge technologies for shaping these business models. These will address not only the transparency of the supply chain, but more importantly the transparency of the hand-making process, the maker's experience, and the value of cultural heritage embedded in it. 

Rural communities of Malay women weavers. 
We will work with at least 50 rural women weavers across Kelantan and Borneo, who will provide direct input into the process of designing both the business models and the technologies enabling them. In addition, they will experience first-hand our digital prototypes through participatory workshops and evaluation studies. Through their engagement in the research project, we expect that these women will specifically benefit through increased awareness of the economic value of their craft's cultural heritage, unique to each woman as it is exclusively transmitted from mother to daughter; stronger digital and creative writing literary leveraged to develop beautiful online presence and stories of their making process; as well as increased awareness of the importance to engage directly with buyers to co-design personalised, unique products. We expect that these benefits will strengthen these women's entrepreneurial knowledge, skills and values. This in turn will empower them on their journey through economic independence through increased customer base (mostly national and potentially international) and increased income through more marketable products. These social and economic benefits have been also identified by the NGOs partners in our project. 

Malay NGO and Governmental organisations. 
We will be engage with NGO and Gov organisations which have foreseen clear economic and social benefits for our target user groups, as described in their letters of support. This project's outcomes can also be beneficial to the Malay NGOs and Governmental organisations, which have invested significantly to revitalise songket weaving. There has been however limited success since these initiatives have adopted the traditional product-centric business model and made limited use of digital technologies. If successful, Digital Threads has the potential to radically change the Malay Government's strategy for prioritizing funding allocation towards programmes focusing on our proposed customer-centric business models, and digital literacy for engaging with the digital technologies such as the ones which we will be designing. 

The Digital Economy of Malay cottage industries. 
Through our integration of innovative business models and digital technologies, we will indicate new ways in which Malay cottage industries can be brought into the 21st century and its worldwide Digital Economy whilst honouring and leveraging their cultural heritage. If successful, the evaluation of our business models and digital prototypes on two types of weaving practices, will suggest their potential to generalise across weaving practices and ultimately to other sectors of cottage industries.

Larger society: innovative applications of blockchain for social impact. 
We believe that the successful completion of Digital Threads project will contribute to the ongoing discussion on the untapped potential of blockchain technologies for social impact in general, and global challenges in particular. For this, we will organise workshops with the public sector to explore the potential of distributed ledger for supporting entrepreneurship at the bottom of the pyramid, and expect that we will build a momentum that future UK initiatives may build on.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>120729</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P014186/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
