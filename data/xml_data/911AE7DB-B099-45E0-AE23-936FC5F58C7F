A medieval devotee's experience of a religious object or a religious space was necessarily visual, sensual and corporeal as much as intellectual. Reconstructing what Paul Binski has called 'the imaginative universe' of medieval art and architecture therefore involves acknowledging that imagination itself is embodied, and that all that a human being can imagine, think or feel is conditioned by that individual's physicality. All that is true for every field of experience, secular as well as religious. But in medieval Christian culture embodiment had an extra dimension: God had become human in the Incarnation of Jesus Christ. His physical death on the cross was the central visual sign of Christianity, and the process of his re-incarnation in the Eucharist was its central sacramental event. For that reason, embodiment - being, or becoming, 'in the flesh' - carried a particular charge in medieval Christianity. During the last twenty years or so historical constructions of the body and bodily practices have become the subject of serious scholarly investigation. In recent years a greater awareness of the multifaceted nature and implications of 'embodiment' have emerged, so that historians of medieval religious culture have become more aware that the body could be not only a fleshly burden, an obstacle to true holiness, but also a vehicle through which to identify with the incarnate Christ and by which to attempt to approach the divine. This provides a good starting point for an investigation of the relationship between embodiment and the affective piety of the late medieval period, and for a consideration of the ways in which medieval Christians negotiated the potentially difficult boundary between physical and sensual opportunity on the one hand, and physical and sensual danger on the other, within their religious practice. During the nine months of the fellowship I will investigate the various strands of thought in the middle ages that were concerned with the senses, with sense perception, and with the relationship between physical or sensual experience and religious devotion. This will result in the completion of two articles, one on the place of music and art within academic investigations of medieval culture, and another on relationships between sound, sight, and the other senses, and on the place of the senses and emotions, in medieval religious experience. This theoretical groundwork will prepare the way for further research, after the period of the fellowship, that will link the theoretical, textual sources dealing with the senses and the body to a detailed examination of the places and spaces of English medieval religious experience, and of the images and material artefacts associated with religious experience, including painted images, books, sculpture (both free-standing and architectural). This, in turn, will be linked with a consideration of the religious sound-scape, including (but not limited to) the music that would have been performed as part of liturgical and para-liturgical religious devotions. This will result in a transdisciplinary monograph on the physicality of religious experience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I expect that the main impact of this research will be felt in three areas or sectors. The first will be the academic community chiefly concentrated within Higher Education Institutions, including academics working in departments of art history and architectural history, music, history and theology. This research will build bridges between areas of academic enquiry that seem to have potential for close connection, but which have not traditionally made those connections. For instance, ecclesiastical historians have chiefly focussed on the workings of cathedrals and churches as institutions, without much consideration of the built environment in which those institutions functioned; conversely, architectural historians have chiefly focussed on the material fabric of cathedrals and churches, without necessarily considering the interaction of institutional activity and architectural fabric. The building of such connections will extend developments made in recent years in some branches of architectural history, where buildings have been considered not just as archaeological monuments, but also as 'stages' for human activity. In addition, the consideration of music as a fundamental part of religious activity and experience will expand upon interactions that have begun to occur between architectural history and musicology, in which specific musical compositions have been considered within the context of the architectural character of buildings in which they were designed to be heard (e.g. Deborah Howard's AHRC-funded project 'The relationship between architectural design and musical composition in sixteenth-century Venice.') \nThe second area of impact will be in bodies such as English Heritage, and the government department(s) with whom English Heritage interact on the subject of the conservation of the ecclesiastical built environment, and on the transfer of knowledge about the historic environment to the public. (For examples of the kinds of debates that could be informed by the kind of 'holistic' research project which is the subject of this application, see English Heritage's report in 2000, 'The Power of Place (http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1447) and the government's response of the following year, 'The Historic Environment: A Force for Our Future' (http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/historic_environment_review_part1.pdf)). As well as the overarching governmental and non-governmental organisations charged with conserving and interpreting the built environment of historic ecclesiastical architecture, the research within this project, and the connections that it makes between different fields of academe, should be of interest also to the individual departments charged with maintenance and restoration of the material fabric of individual cathedrals, abbeys and churches, and those charged with 'interpretation' and 'public interface' within such buildings. \nThe third area of impact will be that sector of the general public to whom cathedrals and other ecclesiastical buildings are of interest, either as members of religious congregations; as members of communities surrounding such institutions; as individual visitors, both national and international, or as members of visiting school/college groups. I envisage that research of this kind, which enables consideration of 'experience' within ecclesiastical institutions, will be of great potential interest to the sectors of the public who visit and care for these buildings.\nBeyond these areas of knowledge transfer, I expect the research to have a more general cultural impact in terms of deepening understanding of the past, and enhancing awareness of historical human experience, and of the nature of being human, an aim which is ultimately at the basis of all enquiry in the Humanities.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Inwardness and interiority are concepts that have a multifaceted currency within many areas of medieval studies. These fields include, but are not limited to, historical studies, theology and religious studies, literary studies, and art history. Studies on inwardness, interiority, and selfhood intersect with an interest in what has often been called &amp;quot;popular religion&amp;quot; and in devotional behavior, both clerical and lay, to produce an engagement, across many fields, with inward or private aspects of religious belief and practice. &amp;quot;Popular religion&amp;quot; has sometimes been presented as generally distinct or separate from (sometimes almost opposed to) official, ecclesiastical, or institutional ritual, and, as such, it is associated with other concepts like &amp;quot;private devotion&amp;quot; and even &amp;quot;interior piety.&amp;quot; Unhelpful binary oppositions are implied by qualifying terms like &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;popular,&amp;quot; because those qualifiers invoke the unsaid &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;outward.&amp;quot; More recently, terms like &amp;quot;vernacular theology&amp;quot; and Fr&amp;ouml;mmigkeitstheologie (theology of piety) have been preferred for their attempt to break down the &amp;quot;high-low&amp;quot; implications of terms like &amp;quot;popular religion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;private devotion.&amp;quot; Though these terms themselves are not without potential problems or implications, the consonance or dissonance between individual religiosity and official or corporate expressions of religious belief can, and should, be examined in a more subtle manner than has often been the case. Medieval religious devotion was not a universally or solely private activity that was in some way opposite to the public, structured religiosity of the church's liturgy. It has been increasingly acknowledged in recent years that liturgy and devotion should not be opposed in this way, as private versus public, free and expressionist versus structured and defined. That having been said, it is nevertheless the case that the kind of piety that we are accustomed to call &amp;quot;devotional,&amp;quot; or contemplative, or meditative, presupposes and requires a certain inwardness and self-awareness, even if such activity is carried out in the company of others, or even during liturgical services.
Particular insights developed through this research include the understanding of silence (within music, within prayer and devotional activity) as an active presence in the soundscape, and not as a lack or an absence. Similarly, invisibility of objects or images did not mean that they were absent from consideration, and the contemplation of invisible images could be a way of thinking through to the invisibility of the divine.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It would be worth exploring the potential uses of my findings around the value of invisibility and silence in medieval religiosity for modern theological and pastoral training.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A1A999EE-989B-4AC1-B2D8-710F31A1CFCF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54527ff48d8042.02310843</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5C8DF41D-4B02-4AB9-8ABB-D98B45AEDD10</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sensory Experience in Medieval Devotion: Sound and Vision, Invisibility and Silence</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Speculum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b9bdfee87c8018d4536157eda87453e9"><gtr:id>b9bdfee87c8018d4536157eda87453e9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williamson B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d012012761bf92</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H032010/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
