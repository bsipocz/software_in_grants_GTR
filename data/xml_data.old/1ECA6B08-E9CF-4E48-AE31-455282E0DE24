It is referred to worldwide as the 'Tree of Life' and is the main source of livelihood for several disadvantaged groups (eg women and landless poor) providing food, fuel-wood, drink, edible oil, fibre, animal feed, building materials and a source of income with minimum capital outlay. Coconut oil is high in saturated fats including lauric acid and is regarded as one of the healthiest dietary oils on earth, helping to prevent heart disease and maintain the body's immune system, and coconuts grow in poor soils that are unsuitable for other crops and help to sustain the environment and beautify coastal landscapes. However, Lethal-yellowing like diseases have devastated plantations in much of Africa resulting in 100% losses in many areas and severe economic hardships in these coconut producing communities. These diseases are caused by a group of organisms called phytoplasmas, which inhabit the phloem and kill the crowns of palms to result in bare trunks. There is no effective remedial action that can be taken to save a palm from death once it has become infected, and the most appropriate way of controlling disease is to replant with resistant or tolerant palm varieties. Coconut breeders have identified some palm varieties from different parts of the world with high resistance/tolerance to the diseases in Africa, and these need to be exploited in breeding programmes to provide improved varieties and hybrids for replanting, to ensure a secure and sustainable industry. Phytoplasmas themselves are poorly characterised because they can not be grown in culture, but new diagnostic techniques and DNA sequencing projects have started to provide us with new tools for studying these diseases. Generally, they are transmitted between plants by insect vectors, but recent evidence has suggested that they may also be transmitted through seed, which is a major concern to Plant Protection, Quarantine and Regulatory Services who have imposed severe restrictions on the movement of germplasm as a result. In this research, the University of Nottingham will provide technical expertise and strategic resources in collaboration with the coconut breeding programme of the Oilpalm Research Institute in Ghana to achieve a greater understanding of the transmission of these diseases and about the nature of disease resistance. Specifically, we will investigate whether seed transmission occurs, by culturing and planting embryos derived from diseased palms and examining them for the presence of phytoplasmas using improved diagnostic and microscopic techniques developed at Nottingham. This will result in conclusive scientific evidence about the risks of phytoplasma transmission through movement of coconut germplasm, which will be communicated to regulatory authorities to help them make informed decisions. We will also use techniques that quantify the levels of phytoplasmas in plants to confirm the distinction between resistance (immunity to phytoplasmas) and tolerance (the presence of phytoplasmas without symptoms) in different coconut cultivars, and establish which lines should be used in breeding programmes and which should be distributed to growers for replanting to minimise the risks of future phytoplasma infection. We will also develop a long term strategy to discover more about the genes that control resistance and tolerance in coconut, so that breeding programmes can be maintained and improved in the future to produce more resistant varieties. In summary, this project will result in the distribution of improved varieties for replanting, and will provide the stakeholders in developing countries with the short and long-term support that they are requesting to sustain and expand their indigenous industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Coconut is a vital crop in much of Africa as a source of food and income, but many palms are succumbing to Lethal Yellowing like (LYD) diseases caused by phytoplasmas. There is no effective remedial treatment for infected palms, so replanting with resistant or tolerant varieties is the best way to manage the disease. However, distribution of germplasm is being restricted because evidence suggests that phytoplasmas might be transmitted through seed and embryo cultures. This project will produce evidence on the risk of seed and embryo transmission, establish which palm varieties possess resistance / tolerance and whether environmental factors influence this, and develop molecular markers to track resistance / tolerance in breeding programmes. To investigate transmission we will produce embryo cultures from infected seed and use molecular diagnostics to determine whether LYD is present, and will plant seeds from infected palms to determine whether LYD is transmitted into progeny plants. Antibodies raised against the LYD SecA protein will be used to develop immunofluorescence microscopy techniques to localise phytoplasmas within infected embryos and inflorescences to show how the organisms might pass into seeds. To examine tolerance and resistance, qPCR or T-RFLP will be used to quantify the levels of LYD in a range of coconut cultivars in Ghana over a three year period. By monitoring specific palms and taking samples during dry and wet seasons, we will show which varieties are immune to disease and which contain phytoplasmas without showing symptoms (tolerance). Established SSR and AFLP markers, and markers that we develop based on resistance gene analogues, will be mapped onto the palms that we screen for LYD to identify markers that are useful for identifying resistant palms to distribute for replanting. At the same time an F2 mapping population will be established as part of a long term programme to map resistance / tolerance traits onto the coconut genetic map.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>355683</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phytoplasma diseases of coconuts</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5701B121-61CC-4144-A8CD-965C29B44AD1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article was printed in the Nottingham Post Newspaper on Sept 15th 2010: http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/City-experts-bid-tackle-coconut-disease-Ghana/article-2643690-detail/article.html

The first objective was to assess the potential for phytoplasmas to be transmitted through seed, which has major implications for the distribution of planting material between and within countries. Whilst it is impossible to prove that phytoplasmas are never transmitted in seed, the results of our experiments, both planting of nuts derived from infected palms and sectioning embryos from infected palms, have provided no evidence that supports the transmission of viable phytoplasma through seed. Similar results on planting nuts from infected palms have been obtained in Jamaica as part of a parallel project CFC/FIGOOF/22 on 'sustainable coconut production through control of coconut lethal yellowing' that was established in the Caribbean to study the taxonomically different phytoplasma (LY) that causes a similar disease in that region. Interestingly, that project decided to use similar techniques to those described in our BBSRC/DFID project because one of the main participants and one of the project advisors were both referees on our original grant proposal. In Jamaica, 402 nuts from infected palms were planted and none of the plantlets have tested positive for LY. However, in parallel studies to ours on sectioned embryos, Dr Carlos Oropeza from Mexico, detected LY DNA in 11 out of 43 plantlets derived from sectioned embryos. It is important to note that only phytoplasma DNA has been found, not any indication of viable infectious phytoplasma, and there may be anumber of ways that DNA could make its way into a plantlet in the abscence of viable phytoplasma. It is also important to note that the normal way for farmers to replant is using nuts not embryos, and both our study and the Jamaica study have found no evidence of transmission through this route. Our results, in which we state that we have found no evidence for seed transmission of viable infectious phytoplasma have been communicated through the CICLY website (14th march 2011 - see below), a world-wide network of scientists and advisors with interests in coconut, and is being used to inform decisions on the distribution of planting material. This has the potential to help the poor, not just in Ghana but in coconut regions worldwide, in that it means that there are no apparent risks associated with the practice that they currently use of replanting from their own seed, which reduces the costs to the farmers of replanting since they do not have to purchase from specific suppliers. This should also facilitate the movement of germplasm worldwide, since it would suggest that movement of nuts between countries is not a major threat for phytoplasma transmission. The key technology that has been developed from this aspect of the work is the technique for sectioning embryos so that a portion of the embryo can be tested for the presence of phytoplasma whilst the remaining section can be regenerated into a viable plantlet, and these approaches are being continued beyond the end of the project both in Ghana and the UK.

The second objective was to monitor levels of phytoplasmas in coconut germplasm, and this involved the development and application of improved diagnostic techniques. This has involved production of a new real-time PCR assay for the Cape St Paul wilt disease phytoplasma, development of new and more robust conventional PCR primers, and the development of the Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification method (LAMP) along with more rapid and cheaper methods for extracting DNA from plant material including coconut palms. These methods have been implemented in the laboratories in Ghana, greatly improving the diagnostics capacity there, and the methods are now being developed further, for example for diagnostics of oil palm diseases. Therefore capacity has been developed beyond that initially envisaged, to enhance and expand the services that can be offered by the Ghanaian partners in their country. The methods have also proven valuable for researchers in other developing countries, and assays have been developed for sugarcane and rice phytoplasma diseases in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, for Napier grass stunt disease in East Africa and for papaya diseases in Ethiopia, and are being developed to aid the CFC project in the Caribbean. 

The third objective was to develop coconut molecular markers and also to provide assays that could be scored easily using the facilities available in Ghana. Initial plans were to develop markers that could be scored on agarose gels. However, with the advent of the LAMP techniques, and the ability of the Optigene Genie machine to provide melt curve analyses, this opened up the possibility of analysing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a marker system, using the Genie machine melt curves to distinguish between alleles. This can be combined with the rapid and reliable 10 minute DNA extraction technique that we have developed as part of this project such that genotyping can be undertaken rapidly in the lab in Ghana at minimal cost (each LAMP analysis combined with DNA extraction currently costs less than &amp;pound;2 per sample, which is significantly cheaper than the old CTAB DNA extraction, PCR analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis, which would cost around &amp;pound;5 per sample. The main cost in the LAMP and genotyping assays is in the cost of the hardware, the Genie real-time LAMP machine, and this technology is now in place to be used in the lab in Ghana. In the project we have developed two different types of assays for measuring SNPs. The simplest is to design primers that amplify regions spanning the diagnostic SNP, use these in a conventional PCR and then undertake the melt curve analysis on the Genie machine to detect the polymorphisms, and this has been shown to work effectively based on a number of coconut sequences. The more difficult system to design is to make LAMP primers that span the SNPs and then use LAMP analysis and the speed of amplification combined with melt curves to distinguish between alleles. This has also been tested successfully, and a paper is currently being written detailing the advantages and disadvantages of these different techniques. From a capacity building perspective, this project has left the Ghanaian partners with the capability to use analysis of SNPs as a means of genotyping and as molecular markers in their coconut breeding programmes.

The fourth objective was to provide decision support on improved varieties for replanting in diseased areas - varieties with resistance to the phytoplasma disease. Throughout the course of the project, we have monitored the most promising hybrids, the SGD (Sri Lanka Green Dwarf) x VTT (Vanuatu Tall) hybrids for presence of phytoplasma infection and signs of disease. These hybrids have remained disease and phytoplasma free throughout the course of the project despite other hybrids (e.g. MYD x VTT) and native palms (WAT) in the vicinity succumbing to the disease and dying. We are now confident that the SGD x VTT hybrids are appropriate material for replanting, and these palms also have good agronomic properties such that the Ghanaian Ministry of Agriculture has been distributing these hybrids to selected growers for the past 2 years as part of their long-term strategy to replant in diseased areas and maintain a viable coconut industry. More of these hybrids are currently being produced for further distribution. In addition, over 200 F2 hybrids have been produced and planted in a diseased area, and these will be an invaluable long-term resource and form the focus of future studies in Ghana to analyse the genetics of resistance through potential production of segregating populations. However, this is a long-term project since it takes a number of years between each generation in coconut genetic studies. It is also worth noting that during the course of this project, a similar disease to the Cape St Paul Wilt disease has been causing significant problems in Mozambique. The phytoplasma responsible is taxonomically very similar to the Ghanaian phytoplasma such that we believe the SGD x VTT hybrids might be successfully deployed in Mozambique. This has been advised, although unfortunately, the Mozambique researchers have to date been reluctant to act on this advice.

Because most coconut farmers in Ghana are landless poor male smallholders, these technologies are primarily aimed at helping them. However, this will have secondary effects of helping the livelihoods of women and the communities along the coastal belt of Ghana where coconuts are grown. The parallel CFC project in the US/Caribbean has also had similar objectives to help landless poor/women in that region and has included workshops on diversification of uses for coconuts and replanting projects like ours.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CACF576E-8408-49E3-A418-83B650413BC1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544cffbc5387c2.42760254</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There are 4 main outputs that have resulted from this work that are of relevance to the poor.
