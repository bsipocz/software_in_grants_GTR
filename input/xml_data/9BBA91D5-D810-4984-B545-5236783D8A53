&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

This project is of substantial policy relevance to variety of key stakeholders looking at the impact of policy decisions on levels of CO2 emissions related to the school commute, and additionally, on those drivers of more active forms of transport, given their associated health benefits. For the first time, geographical heterogeneity of the influences and outputs of a CO2 / mode choice model will be explored, giving policy makers a better indication of the geography of likely responses to their interventions. A by no means comprehensive list of those stakeholders who we would envisage this project to be of benefit include: the Department for Education, Department for Transport, local authorities, school management; and from a cyber infrastructure perspective, Google and other cloud based analytical providers.

In addition to beneficiaries of the substantive output of this grant, from a methodological perspective, social science researchers will also gain a better understanding of how sensitive data can be used within a cloud computing (specifically google) environment. Furthermore, researchers interested in routing applications using the Google service will be provided with additional guidance on how these API can be practically exploited in their work.

How will they benefit from this research?

The model output from this research has a wide range of benefits. For example, within the theme 'Health and Wellbeing', given a specific policy scenario, the model would enable exploration of the loss or adoption of active transport; or, given the fine geographic scales in which the model can be applied, it would be possible to examine street level exposure to vehicular pollutants. You might for example use this information to create &amp;quot;walking bus&amp;quot; routes to minimise this exposure. Furthermore, within the context of 'Environment, Energy and Resilience', it would be possible to expand the literature on the influences of mode choice, to examine how these vary geographically. This would be of relevance when designing policies that encourage more sustainable environmental practices in a switch to a low carbon economy.

Specific deliverables which would be of relevance to a wider [non academic] community include:

The outputs from the national model are incorporated into a series of transport map books (http://www.alex-singleton.com/r/2014/09/09/Transport-Map-Book/) which are available for each local authority district (LAD). Downloads have been recorded, with 349 in total to date, with the the top 10 LAD as follows:Exeter; Liverpool; Oxford; Bristol;York; Sheffield.pdf; Cornwall; Barking and Dagenham; Cambridge; Teignbridge.

There have been direct queries from two further local authorities about the transport atlas and reuse including Wealdon (Malcolm Harris, Policy Officer) and Lewisham (Ronan Smyth, Statistics and Research Officer). Oxford also link to these materials on their website - http://www.oxford.gov.uk/transportstats. 

Furthermore, the DfT (Daryl Lloyd, Head of Road Safety Statistics) have been in contact about future collaborations, specifically in the area of MSc dissertation projects.

Processing of data within cloud infrastructure, and those constraints on use (related to the Data Protection Act) in the social sciences were presented as a short report (http://geographicdatascience.com/cloud/2014/03/15/Personal-data-in-the-cloud/); and integrated into a training course (16 Participants: splits - 38% academic staff; 37% academic student; 12.5% public sector; 12.5% commercial).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9A65610D-4903-4178-AA58-867BB558D700</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460c793d93e93.71810227</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant has developed a geocomputational model that combines street and transport network level routing with geographically disaggregate CO2 vehicle estimates to create a localised new emissions model linked with the commute to school. This work also demonstrated how multiple disparate datasources drawn from providers including the Department for Education and the Department for Transport can be integrated.

A substantive finding that has emerged from this work was that non-geographically sensitive models can both over or under predict emission estimates for local contexts when compared to those geographically specified models developed by this research. Although at a national scale emissions levels are reasonably comparable to non-geographical specified models (the averages smooth away local differences), if policy are to be implemented at a sub regional or local level, then we argued that alternative methods of emission estimates are required.

Secondly, the modelling framework was applied to examine how rates of active travel and emissions could be impacted through targeted or blanket policy change. It was found that in both cases, targeting policy at specific schools could have as much impact as more defuse policy that targeted multiple schools. As such, potential cost savings would be attained by focusing interventions on those most at need groups.

In parallel, this grant also explored challenges related to how sensitive public sector data could be processed in cloud computing environments. In the case of pupil data, it was found to be very difficult (if not impossible) to comply fully with DfE data sharing agreements and relevant Data Protection Act constraints. Alternative &amp;quot;offline&amp;quot; methods were used to calculate routes using open source libraries, and output distances were found to be comparable to those generated through cloud based routing engines. Constraints on cloud computing within this context are reported here: http://geographicdatascience.com/cloud/2014/03/15/Personal-data-in-the-cloud/.

Finally, various methods of street level interactivity visualisation were considered, with the final results presented in a Transport Map Book for each local authority (see RCUK Narrative Impact section).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The model specification and code developed by this research is entirely open and available on github (https://github.com/alexsingleton/routing). It would be feasible for others to refine this model in various ways (as outlined in our published outputs), or implement as is, for either national emissions estimates or local case study analysis. 

Further extension and linkage will likely occur through the Consumer Data Research Centre (ESRC Phase 2 Big Data centres) as the routing methodology developed within this project will be of utility for both the estimation of emissions linked with freight transit, and also other application areas such as accessibility of store types to different consumer groups.

We also expect the dissemination of results to local authority communities to continue through download of the atlases developed by this project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1E9D6419-F22C-4B5E-B2B4-B8581786277C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647bf43d99d0.18263556</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0B3A6E32-F714-4455-B748-5D9FA7C9323B</gtr:id><gtr:title>A GIS approach to modelling CO
