&lt;p>This research seeks to understand why.&amp;nbsp; To understand this phenomenon and in turn encourage growth beyond subsistence entrepreneurship, this research project addresses the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;How do microfinance groups form and how does group composition affect investment choices?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Are there gender differences in response to different forms of microfinance contracts? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What is the role of local information in these contracts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Can alternative contracts, such as microequity, encourage more efficient risk taking and hence accelerate poverty alleviation?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This project fills an important void in our understanding by approaching these questions along two fronts:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>It develops new theory that embeds the group formation and investment choice problem in an environment with both formal and informal financial contracts.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>It uses a series of experiments conducted with actual microfinance clients and micro-entrepreneurs in India and Bangladesh to test, extend, and refine the theory. &lt;br />&lt;/li>

As of this filing, this publication has received 65 citations, many of which leverage this research's theoretical contributions to inform specific development policies such as funding to support internal migration or grace periods for group-based microfinance loans. 

Because of the work completed as part of this project, I have been contacted from numerous consultancies, firms, social enterprises, and non-governmental organizations considering the development of small-scale risk capital such as micro-equity. My research details many of the challenges facing the development of such programs and, together with the results from numerous recent randomized control trials of microfinance in practice, has played a role in moving much of the growth-focused research to larger enterprises (small or medium rather than micro). Current research on microfinance tends to focus on its ability to improve welfare and mitigate the consequences of poverty rather than generate meaningful business growth. The primary impact of this will be to help redirect research and policy efforts to other, potentially more promising avenues to support growth.

Methodologically, the approach of this research was to develop theory and design an experimental setting in the field with a direct mapping to that theory. This was both part of and supports an ongoing movement towards tighter integration of theory and experiments in a field setting. The citations of this work thus far suggest that it is helping influence this trend.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>65DB6CDA-7E6B-4E4F-8EB0-12336891FD42</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545fd189d17064.39112237</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Microfinance has been heralded as a revolutionary development tool. But while the provision of small, uncollateralised loans to poor borrowers in poor countries may help mitigate poverty, there is little evidence that microfinance-funded businesses grow beyond subsistence entrepreneurship. Few hire employees outside their immediate families, formalise, or generate sustained capital growth. This research seeks to understand why.

This project seeks to fill an important void in our understanding of small business growth or the lack thereof by progressing along two fronts. First, it develops theoretical frameworks that captures the salient features of decisions about investment choices and group formation-both forming microfinance groups and establishing multi-person firms-in settings typical for poor individuals in poor countries. Second, the theoretical framework provided a basis for a series of experiments conducted in India, Peru, the Philippines and Australia. 

The key findings thus far extend along two lines. First, traditional microfinance contracts, which make borrowers jointly liable for losses but do not enforce any sharing of gains, generate multiple distortions that can, in part, explain to lack of growth in many microfinance-funded businesses. Second, the nature of decision-making in groups can lead many potential entrepreneurs to &amp;quot;go it alone,&amp;quot; foregoing opportunities for greater gains from group projects in exchange for the security of being solely responsible for one's choices. Certain financial contracts, like microequity, show potential for overcoming these inefficiencies and merit further testing in the field.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Subsequent to the start of this project, the limitations of microcredit as a development tool have been well documented. The findings of this research--that the structure of traditional microcredit may actually discourage entrepreneurship--provide solid theoretical support for this fact. Financial innovations designed to encourage growth and reduce poverty need to recognize the costs imposed by providing group members effective veto power over risky but potentially high-return investments, particularly when losses are shared while gains remain private. The market is responding to this lesson. An increasing number of organizations have replaced debt with grants to finance potentially high-growth micro-enterprises. Such programs attempt to correct the key distortions addressed by this research. While, unlike microcredit, they are not naturally self-sustaining, increased interest in supporting the growth of micro-enterprises is fostering financial innovation that can be informed by these findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CA0620DB-C939-4CC3-A35E-DBEBC2EA1DF3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545fca4fa77860.54943110</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE89DEE1-96A5-4C9A-8175-A64E870CA5EE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Handbook of Microfinance</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aacf491d398aef7c6721a99257e5044f"><gtr:id>aacf491d398aef7c6721a99257e5044f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fischer G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-981-4295-65-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545fc4d9679ec0.36236618</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F108C4A2-2E2C-415D-B3BC-9656BEF4CC80</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contract structure, risk sharing, and investment choice</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0212f60ccc6e1552eab08f2be1fa1df4"><gtr:id>0212f60ccc6e1552eab08f2be1fa1df4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fischer, G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_8911672176cadd2ae0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H010742/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-061-25-0434</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
