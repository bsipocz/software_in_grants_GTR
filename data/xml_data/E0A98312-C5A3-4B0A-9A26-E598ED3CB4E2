Furthermore, street children lack formal representation placing them outside the arena of policy development. Not only do they face multi-faceted problems but as a group they are difficult to define. This is both in terms of their relationship to the street and their status as both victims and perpetrators of crime; their complexity is key to their elusiveness. In addition, street children's independent status positions them outside the realms of child protection which places children under the care of adults, often resulting in limited or no access to services without adult representation. Therefore they have been replaced on the international policy agenda by other vulnerable groups whose human rights violations are much more easily pinned down, such as victims of sexual exploitation or violence, raising fundamental questions around how street children's rights and needs are defined and by whom? However, participatory research is now becoming recognized as one of the more successful ways in which children's voices are beginning to be heard and this can be utilised to offer advice for the inclusion of street children in decision-making and policy development.
The aim of this project is therefore to address the policy gap for street children through research knowledge exchange (KE). An academic-practitioner collaborative research project called Growing up on the Streets was established in 2012 collecting longitudinal data over a three year period with 198 street children from three diverse African cities: Harare, Zimbabwe; Accra, Ghana; and Bukavu, DRC. In addition an innovative participatory approach has been adopted whereby street children are actively engaged in undertaking their own research, under the mentorship of street worker project managers, to explore their capabilities on the streets. The findings from the research forms the evidence-base for this KE project which seeks to bridge the gap between current legislation and political attitudes, and street children's realities. The KE project has seven objectives fulfilled over four phases. Phase 1 develops street young people's participation in the research process from inception to policy development. This aims to include street children's views as a regular part of service provision. Phase 2 develops practitioner participation and capacity through the development of workshops that disseminate key messages from the research as well as through establishing a peer network, initially across Africa, for practitioners to discuss and share through an online forum. This network aims to develop capacity and share best practice for the better provision of services to street children. Phase 3 builds on the others for specifically targeting the policy gap. A series of workshops/events in Africa and the UK, inviting Government agencies, UN members and other key stakeholders aims to raise awareness of the research findings, develop policy recommendations and seek to translate them into concrete actions. Public engagement also forms a key strategy for raising awareness for street children's rights. Finally phase 4 includes a process of reflective evaluation during all other phases to ensure their effectiveness. 
The outcomes of the project seek to offer direct benefit: to street children, by involving them in data analysis and policy dialogue as well as creating NGO training for street children's inclusion in the research process from inception to policy development; to NGOs, by developing a network hub and face-to-face workshops for sharing best practice; and to policy stakeholders (Governments, Donors, International NGOs, UN agencies) through the translation of key messages from the research into policy recommendations with the potential to advocate for direct changes to national and international policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Street children: Through phase 1 they will be given a voice in the process where they have been previously criminalised/ignored. This involves their participation in analyzing key messages emerging from the data. Further, the knowledge exchange (KE) activities will produce a better understanding of children's street realities and the support required to meet their basic needs and access their rights. This will create better opportunities for children's future lives through changes to policy and practice. The street researchers will also benefit from training in advanced engagement skills to enable them to present their own findings to NGOs, Governments and other stakeholders in workshops. These skills will be transferrable to other employment areas. 
Practitioners: This group will be made up of NGOs, government agencies and other social welfare professionals. The training pack developed from training, undertaken in the research based on the innovative participatory methodology and the KE advanced engagement skills training, will benefit NGOs. It will ensure they are adequately prepared not only to do participatory research but to realize the value of children as experts on their own lives and, through using the training pack, more effectively include children in programme design and policy development. The peer network 'hub', as an on-going resource, will provide support for providing advice between African NGOs and street workers to share their own best practice as well as implement changes based on the findings of the research. This group will also benefit from key messages and their implications for practice as presented through briefing notes available freely to download online. 
African and International policymakers: This includes Donors, NGOs, Governments and UN agencies. Through phase 2 (policy workshops) and phase 3 (All Party Parliamentary Group, Consortium for Street Children (CSC), and final KE events) the translation of key messages from the research will be developed into policy and practice recommendations through collaboration with stakeholders and could result in changes to policy. This will drive forward the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR, 2012) agenda for realizing street children's rights by improving their lives internationally, beyond Africa, through access to evidence-based policy and practice. 
Public: Public members and school children in Dundee and London will have the opportunity to learn more about street children's lives through interactive exhibitions and a public lecture to raise the profile of the work and to ensure children and other members of the public are better informed about the lives of street children, their rights, realities and capabilities. Holding this around the International Day for Street Children will boost the attention the research receives in collaboration with other activities in the UK for greater awareness raising. 
Academic beneficiaries: These include researchers, students and academics working in areas of interest to the research and achieved through KE activities, specifically the CSC conference and final event. They will benefit from learning about the innovative methodological approach adopted for the research and the longitudinal nature of the data collection (something not yet achieved with street children). This responds to the call within children's studies to move beyond exploring children's daily lives but to consider them more broadly over space and time. This will have significance for influencing broader urban theories (Ansell, 2009; Horton and Kraftl, 2006; Jones, 2011). The training, peer network and evaluation components of the KE application will expect to see changes to practice during the life of the project. Policy impact at an international level is more likely to be realised after the grant ends. The team's language skills mean policy documents can be produced in English and French to reach a wide audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Consortium for Street Children</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UN General Comment on Street Children</gtr:description><gtr:id>D4004474-9CD1-4C5C-82FA-E6A0913B99B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The report 'Africa Consultation Report for the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's General Comment on Children in Street Situations February - March 2016' was published in May 2016 for the Committee on the Rights of the Child.

More details of how it was used at the eevent and by 100s more street-connected young people supported by around 25 organisations from 18 countries are detailsed in this letter from Street Child United:
30th November 2015
I am writing to thank StreetInvest for your support, through the Growing up on the Streets Knowledge
Exchange programme, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).
This programme resonates with Street Child United and its partners and we are delighted to benefit from
this initiative, which supports street children and youth to recognise the value of their own experiences, to
understand that they are experts on street life, and to develop their role as spokespeople. The Knowledge
Exchange training pack will be used to support our partners as they prepare for the Street Child Games,
which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in March 2016.
This event will unite up to 100 former street children from 18 countries to take part in Olympic-themed
sports, a festival of arts and the Street Child Congress. The Street Child Congress will be a global forum for
street children to lead the discussion and action on the challenges they face and the rights they are
routinely denied. The Congress will focus on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and be designed
on the basics of a model UN-style event, and will enable each young person to become a delegate for the
rights of street children in an impactful way. The outcomes will include individual children's statements,
country-specific resolutions and declarations on specific themes.
In advance of the Congress, we are committed to supporting the young people who will be taking part to
prepare to engage with a wide range of stakeholders. In particular we aim to build their confidence and
communication skills so that they can meaningfully participate in the meeting on 19 March at which they
will present their statements to government officials, UN representatives, NGOs, and the global media.
They will also be able to act as effective advocates within their own countries on their return home from
the Street Child Games.
We anticipate that prior to the Congress, hundreds more street-connected young people supported by
around 25 organisations from 18 countries will benefit from the resources, participating in Knowledge
Exchange activities alongside the young people who will be travelling to Rio. We also look forward to our
continued discussions regarding further Knowledge Exchange activities at the event itself.
We would be grateful if you would pass on our thanks to the Research Directors who have been
responsible for developing the programme:
? F. Patrick Shanahan, Research Director of Growing Up On the Streets and co-Founder of
StreetInvest
? Dr Wayne Shand, Research Director of Growing Up On the Streets and Research Fellow at the
University of Manchester's Institute for Development Policy and Management.

I represent Lifewords Brazil at CONANDA. It is the National Council for the rights of children and adolescents (in Brazil children are up to 11 and adolescents are up to 18) - CONANDA is a permanent collegiate body of deliberative character and joint composition provided for in article 88 of the law No. 8,069/90 - Statute of the child and adolescent (ECA). This is linked to the Special Secretariat for Human Rights of the Ministry of Women, Racial Equality and human rights. It was created by law no 8242, 12 October 1991 and is the body responsible for making effective the rights, principles and guidelines contained in the ECA, law No. 8069, of 13 July 1990.

CONANDA prioritizes the social participation of children and adolescents in their regular activities, encouraging their participation in assemblies, meetings, seminars, conferences and other events, such as participatory rights subjects of their own history, through elected representatives from each State and the Federal District, covering the diversity while respecting the ethnic clipping, race , color, ethnicity and gender. But we are still learning how to do it effectively.
 
CONANDA holds the responsibility of the National Conference on the rights of the child and adolescent (X CNDCA). It will have national scope as well as the guidelines, reports, documents and motions approved. The CNDCA has deliberative character and will present a set of proposals which will fund the establishment and implementation of the policy and the decennial plan of the human rights of children and adolescents, from the strengthening of the rights of children and adolescents by the municipalities, by the States, the Federal District and by the Union, in the context of the construction of the National Policy of human rights of children and Adolescents, covering especially popular participation, the Federal cooperation and inter-institutional collaboration scheme. At all stages of the X CNDCA should debate prioritize quality, ensuring the democratic process, respect Federal autonomy for the plurality and the representativeness of the social segments, within a broad and systemic issues related to the rights of children and adolescents.
 
The CNDCA X aims to ensure the implementation of the national policy and the decennial plan of the human rights of children and adolescents, from the strengthening of the rights of children and adolescents and the following specific objectives (please forgive me for the translation!):
I-sensitize and mobilize society in general in the defense of the Statute of the Child and Adolescent (ECA);
II-strengthen the participation of society at large, in particular, children and adolescents, in the formulation, monitoring and evaluation of the policy and the decennial plan of the human rights of children and adolescents;
III-encourage the creation and strengthening of spaces for participation of children and adolescents on the boards of rights, services, and programs in public and private projects, among others, intended for childhood and adolescence;
IV-propose strategies that promote the strengthening of the rights of children and adolescents for the implementation of the policy and the decennial plan of the human rights of children and adolescents;
V-articulate actors in the system of guarantee of rights to participate in the writing and implementation of the national decennial plan locally (State, region, and the Federal District).
VI-identify and strengthen the mainstreaming of the rights of the child and adolescent theme with the public policies in the three levels of Government;
VII-promote, qualify and ensure the participation of society, especially children and adolescents, in the formulation and control of public policies;
VIII-establish process of educomunicativa coverage of the X CNDCA;
IX-to ensure the mainstreaming of the debate about the fight and the deconstruction of the oppressions of gender, class, race and ethnicity, religion, territoriality, generational, sexual orientation, people with disabilities, street children, in reception and in fulfillment of socio-educational measure;
X-ensure at all stages of the CNDCA X the participation of children and adolescents and the parity of gender, ethnic and racial clipping, and regional diversity.
XI-elaborate for the 12th National Conference on Human rights;
XII-to promote Brazil as international reference of good practices on policies for participation of children and adolescents;
XIII-to strengthen democratic institutions and the very concept of democracy in Brazil.
 
The theme of the the X National Conference on the rights of children and adolescents will be &amp;quot;Politics and decennial plan of the human rights of children and adolescents - Strengthening the local councils for the rights of children and adolescents&amp;quot;.

Growing up on the Streets Training Pack
Dear Professor van Blerk,
I am writing to express the Consortium for Street Children's (CSC) high regard for the Growing up on the Streets (GUOTS) Knowledge Exchange Training Pack. This Training Pack has been invaluable to the Consortium for Street Children (CSC) in 2016. CSC has used the Training Pack to support our ongoing work with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to develop their forthcoming General Comment on Children in Street Situations. 
Between February and April 2016 CSC brought together 370 street-connected children and young people from 32 countries to take part in 7 national, regional and international consultation events in Belgium, Brazil, India, Mexico, Ghana, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In preparation for and during these events, representatives from 69 different NGOs built on and developed exercises from the GUOTS Training Pack to engage participants in games, activities and workshops. Building on the practical guidance provided by the Training Pack, the children and young people involved were encouraged to explore and build understanding of their rights and as a result were able to share experiences of their lives on the streets. Their participation in this process has meant that street-connected children and young people have contributed to and informed the General Comment - a much-needed legal instrument at the highest level. 
In addition, CSC built on the Training Pack in developing materials to communicate to its network of 80 members working in 130 countries ideas to engage children and young people in their own submissions to the UN Committee. A further 674 children and young people were consulted in an additional 8 countries by 41 different NGOs. A list of all the submissions to the UN Committee appears on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights' website here. 
Street children are one of the most marginalised groups in the world and are often forgotten in national and international policy agendas. This consultation process for the General Comment has therefore been an excellent opportunity for street-connected children and young people to directly inform international policy. The combined efforts of CSC, our members and using the GUOTS Knowledge Exchange Training Pack has ensured that the largest number of beneficiaries to ever participate in the development of a General Comment are street-connected children. 
I am confident that the Knowledge Exchange Training Pack will be used by CSC and our network in the years to come.
Yours sincerely, 
Dr Sarah Thomas de Benitez

Wednesday 28th October, 5:30pm-7:00pm, Committee Room 18, House of Commons 

Background information 
This meeting will consider the findings from the Growing up on the Streets research project that relate to State violence against street children and youth in Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe. 
Growing up on the Streets is a unique project because it is longitudinal, having followed street children and youth over three years, and because of its emphasis on children's participation. 198 street children and youth have participated directly in the research that has been conducted about them. In addition, 6 street youth have been trained as researchers in basic ethnographic methods and meet weekly with local project managers to provide a commentary on their lives and those of other young people in their networks. Weekly meetings are supplemented by quarterly focus groups providing an opportunity for more in-depth discussions and involving a wider number of street children and youth. 
The project was developed to examine and better understand the lives of, and conditions affecting, young people living on the street and in informal settlements. The aim of this project is to build an extensive and authoritative evidence base from which to inform and influence street child policy and practice based on street children and youth's own experiences, opinions and priorities.
The research is supported by CSC member StreetInvest with the University of Dundee as the lead academic partner. The Growing up on the Streets research project was introduced to Parliamentarians at an APPG on Street Children meeting in June 2014. 

Objectives of this meeting:
? As a joint meeting between the APPG on Human Rights and the APPG on Street Children, to position the challenges that street children face as human rights and social justice issues within Parliament.
? To get the FCO, DfID and UK Parliamentarians more engaged on issues of State violence and street children.
? To find a Parliamentary champion to continue taking these related issues forward. 
? To ensure street children and youth's voices are heard on issues of State violence. 

Arrivals and registration 5:30-5:35pm

Welcome and Introduction 5:35-5:40pm
Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer

Street children are one of the most marginalised groups in societies across the world. They experience multiple deprivations of their rights on a daily basis, but violence is one of the most persistent. Almost every street-connected child will experience physical and/or psychological violence routinely - violence at the hands of other street children, adults in the community and often from those in a position of authority who should be protecting them, such as the police.

Growing up on the Streets has collected data from 198 street children and youth over three years. This meeting will consider the findings of this data specifically related to State violence against street children in Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe. This data will be invaluable to all those working to ensure that street children can realise their rights. Street children are a complex group to address at policy levels and this project illuminates street children's own experiences, opinions and priorities - something that will prove invaluable to those policy-makers and practitioners who make use of it.

Presentation: Introduction to Growing Up On the Streets 5:40-5:50pm
Dr Wayne Shand, Co-Research Director of Growing up on the Streets and the University of Manchester

Biography: Wayne has worked in economic development and urban management for over 20 years and is currently a consultant and a Research Fellow at the University of Manchester's Institute for Development Policy and Management.

Wayne will provide a brief overview of Growing up on the Streets, explaining the objectives of the research, its participatory methodology and introduce the Knowledge Exchange element of the project, which has trained street youth to engage in dialogue with government official and NGOs. Wayne will highlight the issue of children's rights and the challenges faced by street children and youth in accessing their rights. 

Presentation: Street children's experiences of violence 5:50-6:05pm
Dr Lorraine van Blerk, Co-Research Director of Growing up on the Streets and the University of Dundee

Biography: Lorraine has conducted research with African street children for over 15 years and has published over 60 peer-reviewed articles and two books. She seeks to inform policy makers and practitioners of the rights and realities of street children and most importantly to provide a platform for their voices to be heard. Dr Lorraine van Blerk is the Chair of the Consortium for Street Children's Research Expert Forum. 

Lorraine will present the most recent findings from the Growing up on the Streets project in relation to street children and youth's experience of violence at the hands of the Police and other State bodies. These findings highlight the engrained nature of violence and the experience of street children and youth of mistreatment and abuse by police and other state authorities. 

Street children's voices from Accra, Bukavu and Harare 6:05-6:15pm
Dr Lorraine van Blerk

Adding to the research evidence, Lorraine will share five recent examples of violence experienced by street children and youth, recorded specifically for the APPG meeting by young Research Assistants from across the three cities. These were recorded in September 2015. Voice recordings of these statements will be played at this point. 

Discussion Session 6:10-6:40pm

Dr Sarah Thomas de Benitez would like to make a statement on the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's General Comment on Children in Street Situations. The General Comment will be a pivotal moment in the street children international policy sector and the evidence from the Growing up on the Streets project can support this by linking its evidence to such wider international policy developments.

Questions to kick-start the discussion, if needed:
? In countries where there is limited respect for the rule of law, how can police violence against street children be prevented? 
? Street children face huge levels of stigma and discrimination from the police (and others in the community), how can this be overcome to help reduce the levels of violence against street children? 
? How can the findings from Growing up on the Streets inform DfID and FCO policies/ways of working with street children? And how can Parliamentarians support this? 

Close 6:40-6:45pm
Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer

Street children are an exceptionally marginalised group, experiencing extreme violations of their rights. The Growing up on the Streets project has gathered data that explicitly highlights the direct experiences of violence that street children face on a daily basis, often from those in positions of power and who should be protecting their rights.

As Parliamentarians in the UK and practitioners working around the world, we can support the Growing up on the Streets project to promote its findings and encourage their use in the development of policies and programmes around the world. 

Calls to action: 
? As Parliamentarians and practitioners, we commit to greater inclusion of the voices of street children and youth in the design of services and to promoting use of the Growing up on the Streets data to policy-makers, donors and other NGOs. 
? We call on DfID and the FCO to attend the Growing up on the Streets January Conference to engage in debate with practitioners, donors and international agencies on addressing the needs of street children and youth. 
? We call on DfID to make a submission to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's call for evidence for the UN General Comment on Children in Street Situations

? ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN DIALOGUE AND KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE using the Growing up on the Streets Training Pack. Published in January 2016, the pack was used to support youth participation in the STREET CHILD GAMES and STREET CHILD CONGRESS in Rio de Janeiro in March 2016 (contributing to the formulation of the Rio Resolution) and in knowledge exchange activities with hundreds of children in 18 countries leading up to these events. In February and March 2016 the Training Pack was used in international consultations by the CONSORTIUM FOR STREET CHILDREN (CSC) for the UN COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD, involving 1044 street-connected children with 110 NGOs. Additionally, CSC built on the Training Pack in developing materials to communicate to its network of 80 members working in 130 countries ideas to engage children and young people in their own submissions to the UN Committee. In April 2016, again in Brazil, the pack was used with 450 children at the NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT, in preparation of the National Policy and Decennial plan for the Rights of Children. The training pack is currently being used to inform youth-led research on protracted crises for DFID's youth strategy. 
? KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE EVENTS INVOLVING BOTH STREET CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND STAKEHOLDERS in three African cities. In June, July and September 2015 and July 2016 in Accra (Ghana), Bukavu (DRC), Harare (Zimbabwe), street children and youth engaged in training (using the Growing up on the Streets Training Pack) followed by Knowledge Exchange events with key local stakeholders, including the police, government, judiciary, social work, schools, churches, social organisations, charities, NGOs, and the media. Workshop discussion about project findings with street youth in Arusha, Tanzania (10 February 2016),
? POLICY ENGAGEMENT AND AWARENESS RAISING EVENTS AMONG MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE UK INCLUDING SCHOOL CHILDREN. Knowledge exchange events involving 201 children and 15 teachers were held in May and October 2015 and January 2016 in Dundee and London. Public engagement has included the Dundee Arts Caf&amp;eacute; Lecture (6 October 2015), In December 2015 was awarded the prestigious Market Research Society President's Medal, and we have presented the project to its members (21 April 2016).
? NEW UNDERSTANDINGS AROUND CHILDREN'S VOICES, YOUTH CITIZENSHIP AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT. Meetings and events have been held with policy makers and NGOS interested in engaging with the research and in seeking ways to utilise both outputs and methodologies in their youth strategies. Engagement events include 'Poverty and Youth in Africa: Socio-Economic Challenges and Policy Responses' (Chatham House, London, 27 November 2015), All Party Parliamentary Groups on Street Children and on Human Rights (28 October 2015), International Knowledge Exchange conference (21 January 2016), as well as various meetings with DFID, Consortium for Street Children (CSC), UNICEF.
? EXPERT CONSULTATION to the UN General Comment on Street Children was facilitated by the policy briefings and research findings.
? ACADEMIC IMPACT has been achieved through keynote lectures, including the Social &amp;amp; Cultural Geography Keynote lecture RGS-IBG Annual International Conference 2015 (including to the Royal Geographical Society in August 2016, and the Young Lives conference in September 2016) and publications in press.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AE1EC4B3-8214-4D93-82E8-AEF41B90CCE5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df001a4d6519.79912536</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As a grant for knowledge exchange activity (rather than research), this grant helped us to achieve the following key impacts: 
1. DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROWING UP ON THE STREETS TRAINING PACK designed to engage young people in dialogue and knowledge exchange. This has led to new understandings around children's voices, youth citizenship and youth engagement. It was central to international consultations for the UN COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD, in preparation of the General Comment on Children in Street Situations which will be ratified in 2017 - the Growing up on the Streets network participated in the Africa consultations and the Training Pack was used to engage children and youth in Africa and in other parts of the world, embedding children's voices in the policy process and recognizing the capabilities of street children. The consultations were run by the CONSORTIUM FOR STREET CHILDREN in an international collaboration in which young people were co-producers in international policy. 
2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A PEER NETWORK OF NGOs working with street children and youth (across Africa and also beyond) to engage young people in decision making and to support the development of projects and programmes. Involvement in Knowledge Exchange events has had a radical effect on the practitioners involved who have transformed the way they relate to street children and youth, even though they were already experienced in the field. Please see Briefing Paper 6: Voices of Street Children and Youth.
3. DEVELOPED AWARENESS AMONG MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. In public engagement with adults and children in a variety of sectors in the UK including schools and open events highlighting the issues faced by street children in these arenas. The schools materials are now used by StreetInvest (NGO) for outreach. 
4. ENGAGEMENT DIALOGUE BETWEEN STREET CHILDREN AND YOUTH, NGOs AND GOVERNMENTS. A diverse range of stakeholders (NGOs, local government, welfare services, the police, etc) took part in knowledge exchange events in each of the three project cities: Accra, Ghana, Bukavu, DRC and Harare, Zimbabwe, interacting with the research findings and the participants. The training and knowledge exchange events demonstrated that young people can make a positive contribution to their communities and facilitate change in their own lives, through their involvement in the co-production of policy recommendations and actions for implementation. They became articulate spokespeople, communicating their needs and those of their peers and changing attitudes towards the popular discourse that positions street children as lacking agency. In both Accra and Harare several of the young people who participated in knowledge exchange training are now embedded as street workers in NGOs (Chance for Children, Street Empowerment Trust), further utilising and developing their skills.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings and outputs can be used in the following ways: 
TO INFLUENCE AND DEVELOP POLICY AT NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL around poverty and street children that best supports their needs. Knowledge exchange meetings continue to be held - led by our local NGO partners. 
THE UN UNCRC'S GENERAL COMMENT ON CHILDREN IN STREET SITUATIONS will have a profound impact on how street children and youth are perceived and treated - the UNCRC will continue to promote the rights of street children. 
TO DEVELOP NEW AND INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR WORKING WITH MARGINALISED YOUNG PEOPLE through participant involvement in analysis and developing meaningful messages that accurately reflect their lives. Initial workshops took place in Accra in September 2016 - to be replicated by local NGO partners elsewhere.
ENGAGEMENT AND INFORMATION SHARING ACROSS PROJECTS AND COUNTRIES, THROUGH THE AFRICAN PEER NETWORK. Discussions are ongoing between practitioners alongside street children and youth, with the findings and training used in their work - Managed by StreetInvest. 
SCHOOLS PROGRAMME - taken up by StreetInvest and rolled out across more schools in the UK. This is helping to raise awareness and educate children regarding the issues faced globally. 
CSC (NETWORK OF 80 MEMBERS IN 130 COUNTRIES) have explicitly stated they will continue to use the Knowledge Exchange Training Pack in their work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E3841260-F10A-48D2-B3B2-C1B3442CD60C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df0386477b58.29411517</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.streetinvest.org/guots</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>APPG on Human Rights and Street Children</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB2CFE6C-811E-4E7D-98CA-19EDB3671E82</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dec871e45356.67816479</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultant Expert to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment on Street Children</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A79DAF6-64E2-4A64-9A23-2E27E54BAF8F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dec7df045d28.42180604</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5995D7CE-C48E-4B43-AD04-AB2E90EAEC0D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Growing up on the Streets Knowledge Exchange Training Pack</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bfc1339884694a865895fbf2208f0fff"><gtr:id>bfc1339884694a865895fbf2208f0fff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bennett, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df05f7a0a769.28081013</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B9F4E535-A44A-49EC-B9C4-4D931DEA6917</gtr:id><gtr:title>Methodological Approaches</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5312b7d8fb639b1cfbd7759bdf44a5b5"><gtr:id>5312b7d8fb639b1cfbd7759bdf44a5b5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van Blerk L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-981-287-021-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58ca5f9d8e11a8.98502331</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A63A20F-E45F-4B28-B836-86C0ECCB35CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>THE VOICES OF STREET CHILDREN AND YOUTH: Knowledge Exchange in Three African Cities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/823ed994ac4afbe2a5c20e03bceb39aa"><gtr:id>823ed994ac4afbe2a5c20e03bceb39aa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van Blerk, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df0518de2383.03781215</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ACE15DB2-ED60-414E-B153-0749019A65AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Labouring and Learning</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9cd340929953e79cdfc71960f60761bb"><gtr:id>9cd340929953e79cdfc71960f60761bb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shand W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f6a5e83277.42829325</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M006107/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8DA0F0DB-E15C-4A3D-ADD9-E08898CE6475</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Regional Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
