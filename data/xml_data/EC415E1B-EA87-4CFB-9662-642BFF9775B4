The study of such classes of systems is both challenging and adventurous due to the presence of nonlinearity, interconnections between subsystems, time delay and uncertainty between such models and the real world. The research described in this proposal aims to develop a novel design approach and to provide practical but rigorous solutions to the problems of decentralised observer and controller design for complex interconnected systems using HOSM techniques. The project will strengthen the collaboration between two leading sliding mode research teams to create a framework for this new research area. In order to avoid packet problems with transfer of information between subsystems, decentralised strategies will be the focus of this research. A novel approach involving artificial interconnections will be developed to reduce the conservatism caused by interaction between subsystems when decentralised strategies are employed. One specific focus will be to remove/suppress the undesired chattering to improve closed-loop system performance. The investigator has been heavily involved in research on interconnected systems using classical sliding mode control for over 10 years and has a strong research track record. The project partner has obtained excellent results in HOSM control specifically in chattering suppression, which is internationally leading in the area of HOSM. The expertise of both research teams is considerable and complementary. The experimental equipment provided by the projector partner will be crucial for testing the results obtained. All these factors are very important to guarantee the project success. As the focus of this proposal is to remove chattering whilst preserving the advantages of HOSM techniques and decentralised strategies, this research will bring the advantages of high robustness to uncertainty, ease of implementation, high reliability and increased lifespan of moving mechanical components when implemented in real systems. The research has great potential to enhance economic efficiency.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major theme of this proposal is to develop a new research area by applying HOSM techniques to complex interconnected systems. This research will maintain the advantages of classical sliding mode techniques but avoid the chattering caused by classical sliding mode control. In addition, this proposal combines the advantages of HOSM techniques and the characteristics of decentralised strategies. Advancement in this new research area will be directly/potentially relevant to many systems involving complex interactions, for example, multi-machine power systems, multi-link robot systems and biology systems.

Since chattering will be suppressed/overcome in the proposed research, this will, when implemented in real systems, enhance control performance, avoid unnecessary energy consumption and greatly reduce the high wear of moving mechanical components. The decentralised scheme is more reliable because it will operate even if the information transfer between subsystems is blocked. Moreover, since nonlinear interconnected systems can model real systems well when compared with the linear case, the designed scheme will have high performance and thus the obtained control quality will be high. This research can be applied to multi-machine power systems to potentially increase the lifespan of the system, to reduce energy consumption and to avoid accidents caused by blocked networks. Clearly, these are very important factors and could bring great economic benefits to and enhance the competitiveness of relevant companies. Many industrial companies such as Alstom, British Energy, TRW and BAE Systems could potentially benefit from the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7270</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Autonomous University of Mexico</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Mexico, United Mexican States</gtr:country><gtr:description>KENT_UNAM</gtr:description><gtr:id>128C8560-4852-4264-892F-F9F3D51A4F11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>[1] XG Yan, L Fridman, SK Spurgeon, Q Zhang, Decentralised Observation Using Higher Order Sliding Mode Techniques The 19th IFAC World Congress, 24-29 August, 2014.

A decentralised observation scheme has been proposed for a class interconnected systems when the interconnection is unknown. By employing HOSM techniques in observer design for interconnected systems, a decentralized observation scheme has been formed which can avoid the chattering to improve system performance and save energy. The control strategies has also been developed to deal with matched and mismatched nonlinear disturbance and simulation test on automated highway systems has confirmed the effective of the developed results.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As this is research project provides the first decentralized framework of observer design for interconnected systems using higher order sliding mode techniques, it will attract experts from both areas of decentralized control and sliding mode control.
