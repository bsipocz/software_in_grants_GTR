Intensive livestock units are a particular type of industrial process that are required to apply to the Environment Agency for a permit under the Environmental Permitting Regulations (England and Wales, 2010). Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, and SEPA are consultees in this process. 

Much research has linked ecosystem damage to nitrogen deposition from agriculture and fossil fuels with demonstrated impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, N saturation and the onset of leaching to freshwaters, in experiments and spatial surveys (Phoenix et al 2012; Stevens et al 2010). Currently, around 60% of UK protected sites are expected to exceed their critical load (RoTAP 2012), yet at many there are limited obvious signs of direct impact from N.
This contradiction between the science and site based evidence creates a legislative problem for regulatory bodies with confusion in the dose-response relationships between vegetation and pollution. Modelling based around contemporary pollution suggests a curvi-linear (Field et al 2014), linear (Maskill et al 2010), and threshold responses (Tipping et al 2013). However, the effects of N deposition are thought to be cumulative over time (Phoenix et al 2012) and when species richness values from spatial surveys are modelled using cumulative N, the relationship becomes more linear. It is not clear if this change in relationship type is ecological or mathematical and the legitimacy of either needs further investigation.

The use of cumulative N as an alternative to contemporary pollution deposition also raises questions due to the assumption of a blanket, cross-habitat response to cumulative N. Different habitats and the plant functional groups within those habitats respond to long-term pollution over different timescales ranging from a few years to centuries (Evans et al 2006; Posch et al 2011). There are also issues in accurately calculating cumulative deposition, with estimates of long-term pollution to areas which have experienced increases in N deposition over recent decades likely to be too high, whilst estimates for areas with historically high pollution likely to be too low (Fowler et al 2005). The NERC funded Long term Large Scale Project is attempting to more accurately model 200 year cumulative deposition. 

Dynamic modelling using models incl. MAGIC, GBMOVE and For-SAFE VEG may also offer some solutions to this problem by enabling specific habitat &amp;quot;N-limits&amp;quot; to be calculated, thereby, customising the N response through the addition of a temporal element (Evans et al 2006). Recent testing of models highlights their potential to predict plants species occurrence (Rowe et al 2011) and cover (De Vries et al 2010). An interesting application of dynamic modelling is the reverse calculation of critical loads from modelled vegetation data, with the advantage that future scenarios can be considered (e.g. pollutant reduction). Disadvantages of dynamic modelling include poor forecasting of lower plants that respond directly to N (Smart et al 2005), and a lack of consideration of the different forms of N, particularly the high concentrations of ammonia around intensive farming units (Sheppard et al 2011).

Recent research has also suggested that an absolute ecosystem critical load is unlikely, proposing instead ranges of deposition that drive soil properties into optimum zones for plant species (Posch et al 2011). There is some evidence that this has occurred in surveys, with sites resting on a pH threshold, vulnerable to a step-changes (Field et al 2014), and many species occurring over a deposition range though appearing to decline above a change point (Payne et al 2013).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56495</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'We need to talk about Nitrogen...'

The award set out to understand what opportunities were available from recent scientific advances in dynamic ecosystem modelling and how these might influence the environmental permitting of industrial installations.

To achieve this main aim, 3 objectives were established:

1) To provide a literature review of state of the art dynamic modelling;
2) To review definitions of conservation harm and consider how dynamic modelling can be used to model future conservation scenarios incorporating the temporal component of pollution.
3) To use data from key Natura 2000 sites vulnerable to pollution from industry as a case study for the application of dynamic modelling to understand how the Environmental Permitting Process could be affected.

The final output from the fellowship is a 3-part report considering the above.

To what extent were the award objectives met? 

The award objectives were met, although the report is currently in final draft form. A final policy overview document will be produced in conjunction with EA Evidence Directorate staff.

How might the findings be taken forward and by whom?

The award output tested and highlighted the use of recent advances in ecosystem dynamic modelling to sites used in the permitting of the Electricity Supply Industry. Key opportunities for the future use of models were highlighted, notably:

? There appears to be significant opportunity to use dynamic models alongside conventional legislation. Models are able to make acceptable general predictions of trends and response to changes in climate or pollution at both a broad-scale, and at a site level, although the data requirements of the latter are large. Crucially, models enable the impact of multiple factors on biodiversity in conjunction with each other, more closely reflecting the reality of species responses along pH, nitrogen and other environmental gradients.

? Dynamic modelling also enables the future achievement of conservation outcomes to be based on simultaneous changes in a number of environmental factors including climate change. Modelling also enables the benefit of reductions in pollution at key sites to be explored alongside the considerable lag in soil pollutant pools.

? Dynamic modelling can support decision making through the consideration of the effects of site management on conservation outcomes and life-cycle analysis of the pollutant effects over the life-span of an industrial installation. Opportunities also exist to understand the impact of pollutant reduction on site conservation status, for example the cessation of polluting activities.

Whilst modelling can currently be used to support the decision making process, more work should be undertaken to:

? Test and develop the models to improve accuracy and better understand uncertainties.
? Define conservation outcomes that are both politically achievable and ecologically relevant.
? Understand how long-term pollution, pollution reduction and site management can influence the future achievement of conservation outcomes.
? Develop pollution and climate change datasets to enable longer-term models to be applied.

This work could be taken forward with project-based collaborations incorporating: the conservation and permitting agencies - The Environment Agency, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Natural Resources Wales and SEPA; alongside the scientific community - the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and other collaborating academic institutions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are opportunities highlighted in the section above to use dynamic modelling during permitting of key industrial installations to better understand the temporal component of pollution and the interactive effect of climate change, and the life-cycle impacts of the installation. The definition of conservation outcomes are however, key, and the choice of such can be politically controversial.

There are also opportunities for managers of protected sites to make use of future models, developed to enable non-specialist use, to understand the effects of conservation management interactions on the conservation objectives of a site. Current models are however, complex in operation and require specialist scientific knowledge to operate.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3AF6401C-EF82-4C2C-B183-83A76D44DEC4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf0b2bc2aee5.25915569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>02F4B42B-9031-400F-B1EE-7E8E27A09104</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metrics for evaluating the ecological benefits of decreased nitrogen deposition</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biological Conservation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/900224e2160a21b7989c3e8fc3eec758"><gtr:id>900224e2160a21b7989c3e8fc3eec758</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rowe E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>00063207</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c6cbcd3fad30.71095189</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A512AD96-21C1-4970-AC44-0BA38E7EF5F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Can on-site management mitigate nitrogen deposition impacts in non-wooded habitats?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biological Conservation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/59ac40b969c64db850e438e12bb3e323"><gtr:id>59ac40b969c64db850e438e12bb3e323</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>00063207</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c6cbffafa633.96366751</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F8539471-9FB2-4FCA-A7D8-DAA2C9C95999</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nitrogen deposition increases soil carbon sequestration in heathland soils.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science of the Total Environment</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/520590f156ad5cd004a194f11e7bf84c"><gtr:id>520590f156ad5cd004a194f11e7bf84c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Field, CD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ccde0cfa56.24262473</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M019888/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E94BED75-343A-47C8-BEA1-E1E927732B34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Land - Atmosphere Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE2D53CC-F199-452E-A1FE-B63F4222D636</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
