One such effect is entanglement. Entanglement is a non-local correlation between two modes, which means we can predict with certainty the behaviour of one mode when we know what the other is doing, even if the two are separated by great distances. Normally one would consider the entangled modes to be particles, or their internal degrees of freedom, but recently it was shown that entanglement can exist between regions of space. This type of entanglement is called spatial entanglement and takes the form of non-local particle number correlations between spatial modes. The extent to which we can use this type of entanglement for quantum information processing is the concern of this proposal.Quantum information science began just over ten years ago when it was realised that quantum systems provide a speed up over classical computers when performing certain algorithms. One possible reason for the speed up is quantum entanglement, which allows information to be encoded more densely than in classical systems. Besides the usual circuit model of quantum computation, one other method is measurement-based or cluster state computation. Here a large entangled structure of qubits, called a cluster state, is initially prepared and measurements are made on single qubits in a particular order, destroying the entanglement, but driving the computation forward. Cluster states can be created using neutral atoms in optical lattices where entire arrays of qubits are entangled in three sweeping movements, but here single qubits are difficult to address. On the other hand optical schemes have generated four mode cluster states, where the individual qubits are easy to measure, but the creation of the cluster is highly probable. The proposed research here is motivated by the fact that spatial entanglement is already present in cold gases, so that the need to create a cluster state before computation is eliminated. Moreover we are free to define the spatial modes as we please so we can ensure the addressability of individual qubits. Finding a cluster state in nature would therefore be a very important result. There are three main aims of this proposal. Firstly, we would like to understand the quantum information processing tasks that can be performed using the spatial entanglement structure of cold gases and to describe the underlying physics of cold gases in an information-theoretic context. We will compare the entanglement structure, and hence computational capabilities, of interacting and non-interacting gases and we expect that interacting gases will be necessary for universal quantum computation. Secondly, we would like to understand how interactions with the environment support and hinder quantum information processing tasks. Here it will be necessary to couple the entangled regions of space to certain environments and switch the interactions on in succession. If the environments interact randomly with the gas we expect that no useful computation takes place, but we will learn how efficiently a computation can take place in the presence of errors. If, however, the environment is controlled then a useful computation might naturally take place.Finally, drawing on the results from the earlier work, we would like to explore the experimental feasibility of quantum information processing using spatial entanglement of cold gases. We will be concerned with how to make measurements and rotations on the spatial modes. For instance, in order to make single qubit measurements, one will need to measure the number of atoms in a particular spatial mode. At the moment this problem has not been solved and will be of focus here.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230932</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Project Summary of EPSRC fellowship Libby Heaney



Entanglement is a necessary ingredient that allows information to be processed in a way which goes beyond what is classically possible. For instance, by utilizing the powerful quantum correlations of entanglement one can teleport a qubit between two well-separated locations; communicate information in an extremely dense fashion (known as super dense coding) and perform computational algorithms that are not possible on a classical computer. The main aim of this project was therefore to see whether the natural entanglement that arises between regions of space in cold-atomic gases (mode entanglement) is able to support quantum information processing tasks. 



In two of my publications [PRL, 103 200502 (2009), LNCS 6519 175 (2010)], I demonstrated that the natural mode entanglement of a single particle distributed over two spatial regions could be used for dense coding and teleportation. In order to perform these protocols in full, one requires the ability to execute a complete set of quantum gates that would also allow for universal quantum computing. Thus by default we showed that at least in principle mode entanglement could be used for quantum computing. 



The main restriction in the utilization of mode entanglement of ultra-cold gases for practical purposes is the particle number superselection rule, which forbids isolated superpositions of different numbers of particles. Quantum physics differs from classical physics in the sense that a quantum system can exist in two or more different states at any instance (whereas a classical system would live in just one or the other state). In order to detect or use mode entanglement of massive particles, one would need access to superpositions of different numbers of particles, but this is precisely what is forbidden by the superselection rule. Fortunately previous research suggests that such a superselection rule can be locally overcome by exchanging particles with a reservoir. My research diverged here from the original proposal by investigating how one can use such particle reservoirs and also multiples copies of quantum states to detect and manipulate mode entanglement despite the superselection rules, [see: PRL, 103 200502 (2009), LNCS 6519 175 (2010), PRA 82 032105 (2010) and arXiv:1111.1646 (submitted to PRA)]. This is important since it shows that mode entanglement is as genuine as standard entanglement between two particles and is not just a mathematical feature of the quantum state that is useless for practical quantum information processing. 



A main avenue of research was to investigate how mode entanglement can be detected via Bell inequality tests. Bell inequalities allow to detect the nonlocality (and entanglement) between two or more subsystems. In order to violate a Bell inequality and hence show entanglement, measurements other than the particle number need to be made. While we know that this can be done by exchanging particles with a reservoir, it is thought that this will be difficult in practice. In two papers [PRA 82 032105 (2010), arXiv:1111.1646] we devised schemes to show violation of Bell inequality that used multiple copies of a state and measurements that are easily achieved using standard experimental techniques. Entanglement between two or more regions of space can be detected for small numbers of particles. The scheme and results hold for massive and non-massive particles and should be relatively straightforward to perform experimentally. 



Furthermore, I devised a new test of nonlocality for the mode entanglement of a single particle distributed over multiple regions in NJP, 13, 053054 (2011). Here surprisingly the scale of violation increased as the particle was superposed over a larger area of space, making the test comparable to the famous GHZ test of nonlocality. We provided a scheme that allowed to implement this test using a single photon in an array of cavities, where coupling to atoms allowed to make the required measurements. Further inequalities were given that lead to more robust experimental tests. After the publication of this paper we received a notice saying that it was downloaded 250 times within the first 10 days. I contributed to a further paper [PRA, 82 032105 2010] investigating how multi-partite Bell inequalities can be violated using separable states but entangled ancilla systems. 



Mode entanglement along with conventional particle entanglement was characterized in a system of coupled cavities in collaboration with a group from UFMG, Brazil [NJP, 14 043033 (2012)]. Cavities containing atoms are coupled by a photonic mode, which leads to the photons gaining an effective mass and behaving in some part like a ultra-cold gas. We found here that the amount of entanglement between the different constituents in the system was an indicator of the phase of the system (i.e. whether the system behaved more like a fluid or a solid). We also saw that entanglement can still be such an indicator under the experimentally realistic conditions of an uncertain number of particles and disordered system parameters. This complements the results found in [PRA, 80 022338 (2009)], which show that one can use the visibility of interference fringes between different regions of space (which is easily measurable in experiments) to detect their mode entanglement. The single-particle reduced density matrix can be applied to standard ultra-cold gases, but also to hybrid type systems such as the coupled cavities. We illustrated our results here using bosons in a split trap configuration, and similarly to the coupled cavity entanglement we showed that as the system passed into the 'condensed' phase the entanglement became more pronounced. 



Towards the end of this project I became interested in whether quantum effects such as entanglement play a role in biological systems. Over the last five or so years it has become evident that quantum coherence (superposition) is responsible for a speed up in energy transfer along a network of sites in photosynthetic complexes. To that end I investigated whether an analogous transport mechanism existed within bacterial and eukaryotic cells. I found that electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory complexes (which generate chemical energy for cells) had been previously modeled using semi-classical Marcus and Hopfield theories. In collaboration with physicists in Oxford and mitochondrial biologists in Cambridge , we developed a fully quantum, microscopic model for single electron transport within respiratory complex I, [see arXiv:1111.1646, in submission PRL]. We found that a small amount of quantum coherence of the electron between different sites within the complex (which can also be considered as mode entanglement between the sites) gave a speed up in the transport of the electron down that chain of 10%. It is important to have a greater understanding of the physics of such respiratory complexes as in humans defects in them can lead to cancer, alzheimers and other neurodegenerative diseases. 





The main beneficiaries of this work will be other scientists working in the fields of quantum information and ultra-cold atomic gases. Unlike the mode entanglement of a single photon, mode entanglement of a single massive particle has not yet been experimentally verified. This verification is important from both a fundamental and applied perspective, since an experimental test of mode entanglement would not only show that the particle number superselection rule can be locally overcome, but would also show that mode entanglement of massive particles is not just a mathematical artifact of the quantum state and is useful for some quantum information processing tasks. 

My work suggests a number of ways in which one could perform an experimental test of mode entanglement of massive particles and further QIP applications. I have spoken about my research at big international conferences such as the 'Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication, and Cryptography' conference and 'Conference on Quantum Communication, Measurement and Computing', along with a number of smaller conferences in the UK, USA and Brazil. Moreover, I was invited to speak about my research at the UK-Brazil Frontiers in Science meeting in 2010. 





Other beneficiaries of this work are non-experts in quantum physics, such as undergraduate students. A single particle in an infinite square well is the quintessential example of basic quantum physics. Using results from this project one can illustrate the more advanced concepts of entanglement, nonlocality, teleportation and super dense coding using this easily understandable quantum system. I have presented such work at the undergraduate conference in Oxford on two occasions. 



There are still a number of unanswered questions from this project that are still under consideration. I am co-supervising a PhD student in Oxford, who is investigating experimentally accessible measures of mode entanglement of massive particles. I have also discuss with Immanuel Bloch (Munich) about the possibility of testing for mode entanglement, and I am currently working on a scheme to test for this type of entanglement within his experimental set-up.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DD051167-C926-4F5A-9CE0-18D22DE20800</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9602087242.1582177983e9e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>44F915DB-968D-4C9F-94EA-A4DD0794E7A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bell
