Since the work of Steinberg, one knows how to construct such a group as the (possibly twisted) rational points of an algebraic reductive group defined over the algebraic closure of a finite field. For example, the group GL(n,q) is obtained by restricting the coefficients of any non-singular matrix to the finite field with q elements. From that geometrical point of view, two directions have been investigated : - how to deduce algebraic and structural properties from the theory of reductive groups over an algebraically closed field; - how to produce representations coming from actions of the finite group on a family of algebraic varieties. This last point has been initiated by Deligne and Lusztig and intensively studied in a series of papers by Lusztig.There are different notions of representations, depending on the coefficient ring. Any representation can be viewed as a lattice or a vector space, together with a linear action of the group. The advantage of the construction of Deligne and Lusztig is that there is a canonical way to linearize the geometric action of the group, with respect to a large family of rings, including the ring of l-adic integers Z_l, where l is a prime number different form the characteristic of the finite field. I am interested in the modular representation theory in non-defining characteristic, that is, the case where this ring is a finite extension of Z_l. In some way, it is the most sophisticated case, since the others are obtained by scalar extensions or reduction mod l. With the pioneer work of Bonnaf and Rouquier in this direction, there are now good evidences that the Deligne-Lusztig varieties should encode many parts of this theory, including blocks, projective modules, decomposition matrices. The main aspect of my work during this Fellowship will be to extract and decode this information. I will be particularly interested in Brou's conjecture and in the modular analogue of Lusztig's character sheaves.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It would be dishonest to say that research in pure mathematics, and more specifically in the field of representation theory, has a strong and direct impact on the national economy and enhances quality of life. I like to think that pure mathematics is, as Alain Connes says, a manufacture of concepts . These concepts are introduced, developed and extensively studied by mathematicians to form a hotbed for modern science (just like philosophy for humanities). Indeed, many recent (and unexpected) technological improvements are based on mathematical theories. For example, the development of representation theory has led to: - the linear codes, part of many wireless transmission methods (internet, satellite...), which rely on representation theory with coefficients in a finite field; - a significant progress in particle physics, which benefited from new Lie-theoretic structures in representation theory (such as Fock spaces). Both of these aspects are part of the algebraic lie theory, which is the main theme I want to focus on. Unfortunately, none of the mathematicians can (and should) predict what will be the global benefits of his research. The digestion process takes time and one cannot reasonably know who will benefit from it (how could Radon possibly think that his results would have a major impact in medicine with scanners and MRI's?). Therefore, the only relevant beneficiaries I will consider are academics (in pure and applied mathematics or in related fields, see the corresponding section for a detailled list) and the broader audience. However, one can certainly maximize the opportunities for other users to benefit from ones research by disseminating the research at different levels: - with the help of existing networks (such as the UK/French network Representation theory across the channel ); - by presenting the research at interdisciplinary workshops and conferences; - by reaching the wider public with an attractive website with historical notes and overviews . Moreover, such a media will be likely to be used to draw the attention of other potential beneficiaries, coming from the commercial private sector. Besides, I will certainly organize regular high-level meetings with UK-based representation theorists to keep up with recent developments in the field. Finally, I deeply believe that I could make the general audience benefit from my research, not directly, but by raising their interest in the subject.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237707</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77AB548C-1AEB-430F-B882-AFB4F88CA121</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coxeter orbits and Brauer trees</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfbfb48bd548525828d978ff642efab2"><gtr:id>cfbfb48bd548525828d978ff642efab2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dudas O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe2fe2be4a812</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66B17148-1AF6-4621-B642-463D6EB2EC88</gtr:id><gtr:title>Representations of Finite Groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oberwolfach Reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1d4cc485dd878f94167ef22b0d07b3d"><gtr:id>e1d4cc485dd878f94167ef22b0d07b3d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chuang J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0890895f5821e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A26B5FA-6D4E-46C4-B8A2-33F6F586439D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coxeter Orbits and Brauer Trees II</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Mathematics Research Notices</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfbfb48bd548525828d978ff642efab2"><gtr:id>cfbfb48bd548525828d978ff642efab2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dudas O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d046046fcba91d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F2E39E51-306D-4A74-B179-FB0B59F2014F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quotient of Deligne-Lusztig varieties</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Algebra</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfbfb48bd548525828d978ff642efab2"><gtr:id>cfbfb48bd548525828d978ff642efab2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dudas O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff7ff7f178f95</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H026568/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
