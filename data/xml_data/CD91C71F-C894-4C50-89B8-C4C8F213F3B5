A group is a mathematical structure: a collection of objects which can be added together like normal numbers. There must exist a unit : an object which when added to any other object does nothing, and each object must have an inverse : when an object and its inverse are added, we get the unit. However, unlike for usual addition, it is possible that the order of adding matters.Good examples arise from symmetry groups. Consider the rotations of a cube: this forms a group. The unit is the rotation by a zero angle, and addition is doing one rotation and then another: a bit of thought will show that the order you add rotations does matter! Notice that there are only finitely many rotations which leave the cube invariant. If we considered instead a sphere, then you can rotate by any angle, and so we get an infinite group. However, this group also have a notion of continuity : it makes sense to say that two rotations are close . We shall be interested in Locally Compact groups: these have this notion of continuity, but are also not too large in some technical sense.When the order of addition in a group doesn't matter, we say that our group is abelian. A locally compact abelian group has a dual group , which has an intimate relation to the Fourier transform. In everyday life you meet this when listing to music: the sound-wave is split into its component pure frequencies- we can think of these as building blocks. The group here is the real numbers under addition, and the pure frequencies are the periodic functions.When a group is not abelian, there are various notions of the dual , but none of these is an actual group. A way to deal with this problem is to give up on groups, and instead look at an algebra built out of the group (an algebra is a related mathematical structure with both addition and multiplication, interacting as you might expect). It turns out not to be so hard to define the algebra which should correspond to the dual group: even though the dual group doesn't actually exist! This is a slight mathematical fiction, but an incredibly productive one, which underpins what we call non-commutative mathematics . Often the term quantum is also used, as such objects were historically first considered in quantum mechanics.So, a quantum group is an algebra which looks like it is built from a group; a Locally Compact Quantum Group has some sort of continuity (technically, the algebra should be an Operator Algebra).While groups are interesting, in natural situations, we often only have a semigroup: this is when we lose the inverse axiom. An example arises from physical systems: classical mechanics, like the motion of a ball, are time-reversible, and so we get an action of the real numbers. But heat flow, for example, naturally only evolves forward in time, and so we are typically only interested in the semigroup of positive reals. We shall be interested in compact semigroups (which are, in some sense, small: the group of rotations of a sphere is compact, but the real numbers are not, as you can continue going out to infinity forever). We play this smallness off against weakening the continuity assumptions. Given a group, we can associate various universal compact semigroups to it: these have uses in combinatorics, and the abstract theory of group actions (topological dynamics) for example.Classically, one can build these compact semigroups out of various algebras associated to a group. By analogy, we get definitions for quantum groups. Alternatively, one can try to find an intrinsic definition of a quantum semigroup . Our project is to try to reconcile these two approaches (they are known to be different in some cases). Furthermore, we shall seek suitable definitions for a quantum semigroup which has rather weak continuity properties.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We split the impact into a number of sections: Dissemination: This project is in pure mathematics, and the immediate research outputs will be mostly of interest to academic mathematicians. We shall publish our results not only in traditional journals, but also on the arXiv, and will make slides from talks and presentations, as well as informal notes, available on our personal website. This will allow timely, and also open-access, dissemination of our results, reaching the wider public, as well as, say, academics in developing countries. The PI has considerable interest in using web 2.0 tools, such a wikis, or the recent website www.mathoverflow.net. We will continue to explore and participate in such online communities which are more open, and reach a far wider and diverse range of people, than more traditional publishing routes. People: The project will have major impact upon the training of the PI and PDRA, and will facilitate them both to have productive careers in mathematics. Outreach and teaching: The PI is a lecturer, and will teach during and after the project. Thus the PI will have a major impact upon his students; they in turn will have impact upon a vast range of fields. While the project itself is technical, support of research does impact teaching at a distance: the best teachers are those who continue to be passionate about their subject. The PI has been involved in a number of workshops for a range of ages of school children, and will continue to regard such outreach as an important part of his career. Further impact: The study of compact quantum groups arose quite explicitly out of mathematical physics. While our project is interested in pure mathematics, we are deliberately considering some foundational questions, and it seems likely that our ideas will eventually have impact upon mathematical physics, and thus on applications; but these are long term considerations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99613</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This funding was to support research in &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fundamental&amp;quot; Mathematics.

This is an area interesting algebra, analysis, probability theory and topology. A group is an abstraction of the idea of symmetry, compact groups are &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; in some sense, and here &amp;quot;quantum&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;non-commutativity&amp;quot;. To be technical, we work with non-commutative C*-algebras, and the &amp;quot;groups&amp;quot; involved are really C*-algebras which somehow represent an abstract notion of symmetry. Such objects originally arose in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, but these days are perhaps more of interest for their mathematical structure, and their links with other areas of operator algebras.



The project was interested in studying the properties of such objects. In the paper &amp;quot;The Haagerup property for locally compact quantum groups&amp;quot; with Fima, Skalski and White, we looked at the Haagerup property, a sort of weak approximation property, mainly for discrete quantum groups (the duals of compact quantum groups). We have a systematic study, proving many theoretical results. This area has recently been very active, and our paper provides useful link between many results in the area. It will appear, under Open Access, in Crelle's Journal (Journal f&amp;uuml;r die reine und angewandte Mathematik). The mathematical link with the rest of the project comes from formulating the Haagerup property in terms the corepresentation theory of the quantum group.



The main thrust of the project was concerned with &amp;quot;compactifications&amp;quot;: how to build compact quantum groups from general (locally compact) quantum groups. I made initial progress on this problem in the paper &amp;quot;Remarks on the Quantum Bohr Compactification&amp;quot;, to appear in the Illinois Journal of Mathematics (and available on the arxiv). He I built on work on Soltan and Runde, clarified many technical issues, and I stated a number of concrete problems for future work. We have not made progress on these, but we know that colleagues have become interested.



The project employed a postdoc, Dr Biswarup Das, who has now obtained another postdoc, working at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw (I see an import &amp;quot;outcome&amp;quot; as being the training of future academics, and it's welcome that Dr Das has stayed in the EU). We looked at various questions raised the paper mentioned about, but did not resolve these in entirely satisfactory ways. We then moved on to looking at special sorts of group actions: namely on Hilbert spaces (within Functional Analysis, the vector spaces with a maximal amount of symmetry) and the related notion of an &amp;quot;Eberlein compactification&amp;quot;. This work is now available as a preprint (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1109 ) and has recently been accepted by the Indiana University Mathematics Journal.

The long-term plan here is to study &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot; compactifications, which are well understood in the classical case, but are hard to even make sense of in the non-commutative setting. Recent progress (obtained after the funding ended, but very much motivated by work supported by the funding) has been made here, see http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7302 )</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research will be of use to Mathematicians working in Operator Algebras and Quantum Groups. As a piece of theoretical Mathematics, it is unlikely to have direct exploitation outside of Mathematics, but it's our view that the overall enterprise of Mathematics has in the past, and is likely to have in the future, an amazing amount of application in many diverse areas, and it can be hard to separate out one area of maths from another.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35B75CD9-8EC6-4327-B09A-6C192184A6D4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9721412267.2764777805d60</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB943533-B952-4F61-90B9-38BB080F4177</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remarks on the Quantum Bohr Compactification</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Illinois Journal of Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cbc1b6c3a75bc37edbe61b082fb533bf"><gtr:id>cbc1b6c3a75bc37edbe61b082fb533bf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Matthew Daws (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_5417097705136a00fa</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>714C3DA1-4021-46A4-9252-4583A612014B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Completely positive definite functions and Bochner's theorem for locally compact quantum groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Functional Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9127b708cf3e03726a0b356d34a94fb1"><gtr:id>9127b708cf3e03726a0b356d34a94fb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Daws M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f977977fe3e54a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D2B87649-2F6B-43F6-BF7B-054D42154902</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantum Eberlein compactifications and invariant means</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Indiana University Mathematics Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9127b708cf3e03726a0b356d34a94fb1"><gtr:id>9127b708cf3e03726a0b356d34a94fb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Daws M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5448e6510d2690.10320425</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B7FD0624-D901-44E7-A1A4-C70C54525A8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Haagerup property for locally compact quantum groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal f?r die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelles Journal)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9127b708cf3e03726a0b356d34a94fb1"><gtr:id>9127b708cf3e03726a0b356d34a94fb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Daws M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0820825bf3603</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I026819/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
