Sudans</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/L009382/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Individuals sampled from across the world show great diversity in their DNA. However the primary features that lead to this diversity are poorly understood. For example, it is well-known that groups residing in close geographic proximity often have similar DNA patterns relative to groups residing further away, but what sorts of anthropological or topographical features best predict these similarities? Do rivers provide gateways for promoting interactions among different groups and thus lead to DNA exchange among these groups throughout history? Do natural features such as mountains provide a major barrier to such interactions, or is not sharing a language or religion a more important barrier? Have the important features that promote genetic diversity changed over time? 

The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopian, the Republic of Sudan, and the Republic of South Sudan show great cultural diversity, with for example over 100 different languages spoken and over 100 different ethnic groups living within. The history of many of these peoples are poorly understood, with historical records often incomplete or contradictory. Recent studies have shown that the DNA of these groups are also highly diverse. This DNA provides a powerful means of resolving historical inaccuracies, and identifying the aforementioned features that promote intermixing among the different groups that have shaped the genetic landscape of this region for tens of thousands of years. 

In this project, we will develop and apply new, state-of-the-art statistical methodology to a novel DNA collection consisting of samples from several hundred Ethiopian and Sudanese individuals. We will identify the features that have shaped the genetic diversity of this unique region of the world, identifying historical events where different ethnic groups within these regions exchanged DNA, as well as DNA contributions from sources outside the countries' borders. Some of this methodology has been successfully used recently to explore the history of the United Kingdom, a part of the world with considerably less cultural and genetic diversity (http://www.peopleofthebritishisles.org/). Elucidating the dynamics of how groups interact genetically will have great implications for understanding how gene flow persists among populations historically and today. Understanding the genetic structure of this diverse region will also help future researchers design sampling strategies for studies testing whether particular regions of the genome are associated with common phenotypes such as height or disease status. 

This region of east Africa is also vital for studying human origins, housing the earliest known human fossil remains that confirm a history going back approximately 200,000 years. It is well-established that modern humans first arose in sub-Saharan Africa, and it is believed that Ethiopia and the Sudans were the gateway for the initial migrations of peoples out of sub-Saharan Africa when colonizing the rest of the world. By careful comparison of the DNA of the groups from this region with those outside of sub-Saharan Africa, we may be able to infer the routes taken by these early explorers and map out precisely how the world was colonized by migrating humans.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Although it is well established that DNA differs substantially among different world-wide groups, the principle forces driving human genetic diversity are not well understood. One of the major outstanding questions in human evolution is whether present-day levels of diversity are primarily attributable to recent intermixing among populations (i.e. admixture) or ancient substructure. In addition, we still have only a limited understanding of the impact of factors that influence DNA exchange among populations, such as topography and geographic proximity, access to rivers, or other social factors such as shared language or religion. 

With this project, we will genotype 2000 individuals spanning 95 different ethnic, occupational, or regional groups sampled from the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Republic of Sudan, and the Republic of South Sudan. Each Ethiopian and Sudanese sample has information on the donor's birthplace, first and second languages, cultural label, and religion for some samples, plus the equivalent information (excluding religion) for the donor's father, mother, paternal grandfather, and maternal grandmother. We also have cartographical and altitude information on numerous villages across these regions. We will apply novel statistical methodology to these samples to identify recent admixture events among these different groups, as well as DNA contributions from neighboring populations. We will then elucidate the anthropological and topographical features that most strongly determine which groups exchange DNA. We will infer the DNA of the ancestors of these present-day groups by subtracting out the signals of recent admixture we identify, and we will quantify the extent of genetic distinction among these ancient sources. By developing new statistical methods, we also aim to exploit the rich history contained in the DNA of this part of the world to infer details of human origins, including the early migration(s) out of Africa.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Collaborator Endashaw Bekele is Professor at Addis Ababa University and Director of the Human Genetic Variation Center (HGVC) at the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia. The HGVC has a remit from the Ethiopian government to encourage the study of human genetic variation in Ethiopia by overseas researchers, with a view to developing local expertise in undertaking clinical trials that take account of sub-Saharan genetic diversity. For example, Bekele and collaborator Neil Bradman have collected blood and phenotype data from 300 Ethiopian samples, including 25 individuals from each of five distinct Ethiopian groups who are being whole genome sequenced (WGS) by collaborators Luca Pagani and Chris Tyler-Smith. This phenotype information includes height, weight, BMI, standard anthropometric data, blood pressure, spirometer, colorimeter, spirobank, bio-impedance readings, urine analysis, personal disease histories and lifestyle information, as well as sociological data for the subject and the subject's parents and grandparents as recorded in the larger collection described in this study. The proposed study will elucidate the genetic diversity among over 80 additional ethnic and regional groups from Ethiopia and the Sudans, thus defining sampling strategies for forthcoming similar phenotype collections. All samples and our results exploring genetic diversity will be made freely available to researchers upon publication of the first primary manuscript (anticipated at the end of year 1-2). The PI will also visit Addis Ababa University as a guest of Prof Bekele during years 1-3 of the project, explaining the primary results of our studies into the genetic landscape of Ethiopia and the Sudans and advising on sampling strategies for future phenotype collections. 

Dr. Bradman is Chairman of Henry Stewart Talks Ltd (http://hstalks.com/), which publishes The Biomedical and Life Sciences Collection of over 1,600 specially prepared online seminars by leading world experts. These seminars are provided for free to over 75 universities in sub-Saharan Africa, including 15 from Ethiopia. Subscribers to the collection includes most of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies as well as research institutes and universities in over 40 countries. We will provide at least one seminar describing our project's findings, anticipated for year 2-3 of the project. 

The post-doc employed on this project will develop and apply state-of-the-art statistical techniques to a large-scale genetic data collection, as well as lead an international collaboration. Any new methodology developed during this project will be made freely available to academic researchers upon publication of methods. Visits to Addis Ababa University may lead to collaborations between UCL and Ethiopian PhD students, similar to UCL Prof Dallas Swallow's on-going co-supervision of Tamiru Oljira of Addis Ababa University on projects studying allelic heterogeneity in lactase persistence among Ethiopian groups (e.g. Ingram et al 2009, J Mol Evol 69:579-588).

Finally, understanding human history, including the genetic legacies of known population migrations, is of enormous interest to the wider public. The PI has participated in two public presentations of a similar study to the one proposed here that instead uses United Kingdom samples (POBI). This work featured in both The Royal Society Summer Exhibition 2012 (http://sse.royalsociety.org/2012/exhibits/genetic-maps/) and the Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair 2013 (http://www.thebigbangfair.co.uk/). We anticipate similar interest from the public and media from this project, from our initial publications describing the genetic structure of Ethiopia and the Sudans in years 1-2 of the project to our findings on ancient human demography anticipated for year 3.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>502681</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Addis Ababa University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ethiopia, Federal Democratic Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ethiopian researchers</gtr:description><gtr:id>E28D4AA4-8720-4B8B-B718-01E99B2BBEBA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(1) the printing and distribution of 500 pamphlets &amp;quot;Exploring the genetics and ancestry of peoples in Ethiopia&amp;quot; relaying early results of our genetic findings on Ethiopian samples included in this project

(3) a recorded interview for local Ethiopian TV</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d09b0d02e0.58651208-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our tour of nine lectures across Ethiopian institutions were followed by debates and discussions that lasted from 30 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes per lecture. As these lectures were attended by Ethiopian academics with specialist knowledge in linguistics, history, anthropology and other fields, we were provided with invaluable feedback about (i) how to into interpret our genetic findings, (ii) how best to relay this information to the public in light of ethnic sensitivities within Ethiopia, and (iii) a list of specific hypotheses, involving relationships within and among different ethnic groups, to test using genetic evidence. Furthermore our contacts in the above universities enabled the above lectures to take place. 

In particular, Dr. Ayele Tarekegn of Henry Stewart Talks, a resident of Addis Ababa, accompanied us on our entire trip. Dr. Tarekegen acted as an interpreter for Amharic-to-English, a guide (with a degree in history), and an invaluable resource as someone who (i) did the vast majority of sample collection across Ethiopia and (ii) has recently translated a book recording the oral traditions of groups in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Regions (SNNPR) that was initially printed (in Amharic) by the Council of Nationalities of the SNNPR. He also arranged our flight and car travel and hotel accommodation, in addition to arranging the final times and locations of each lecture.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>During the period 27/2/17 to 11/3/17, the PDRA (Dr. Saioa Lopez) and I undertook a series of nine lectures at nine different venues across Ethiopia, as part of our BBSRC grant. This included talks at University of Gondar, Hawassa University, Arsi University, Adama Science and Technology University, Axum University, Haramaya University College of Health and Medicine, Haramaya University main campus (Harar), Addis Ababa University, and the Ethiopian Academy of Sciences (EAS). The latter EAS lecture was for a broad audience of over 100 people that included Ethiopian academics, politicians, university students, high school students and lay people. These lectures disseminated the early results from our analysis of the DNA of over 1,100 Ethiopian individuals representing over 70 ethnic and social groups. 

We met with Ethiopian academics from each of the above institutions. We also provided a radio interview to 105.3 Afro FM (http://www.afro105fm.com/i/index.php) in Ethiopia. I also recorded an interview following the EAS presentation, to be aired on local television.

Also as part of this trip, Dr. Lopez and I wrote two versions of a pamphlet that summarized the key findings. One &amp;quot;simplified&amp;quot; version was 13 pages long and offered a simplified report of our findings appropriate for a very broad, lay audience without scientific training. The other &amp;quot;extended&amp;quot; version was 33 pages long and offered a more detailed report appropriate for a scientific (e.g. university) audience. The printing of this pamphlet was paid for using &amp;pound;1000 in funds won by Dr. Lopez from a &amp;quot;Focus on the Positive&amp;quot; program contest arranged through UCL, which allowed the printing of 400 &amp;quot;simplified&amp;quot; versions and 100 &amp;quot;extended&amp;quot; versions. These pamphlets were distributed to the audiences that attended our lectures, with some &amp;quot;extended&amp;quot; versions provided to our academic hosts to provide to campus libraries and to people (e.g. their students) with more technical backgrounds. We further left copies of the pamphlets at other venues, including airports and a library in Harar.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Tehran</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Iran, Islamic Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Naser Ansari Pour academic visit</gtr:description><gtr:id>9362EDD3-332B-49F8-B00E-3F29BDC4731F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes yet -- collaboration just began in February 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc1efea1aba3.43730664-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr. Ansari Pour has provided expertise from his studies at UCL on Y chromosome and mitochondrial data from African individuals taken from the same UCL collection that we now have genome-wide genotype data for as part of this grant.

Specifically, we reported new results that form part of a long-standing collaboration with researchers in Ethiopia, that studied the genetic information of over 1,100 Ethiopian individuals representing over 70 different ethnic or social groups. For the first time, we have reported the detailed genetic structure of these groups, illustrated how strongly genetic relatedness correlates with geography, common language, ethnicity, and religious affiliation. We further illustrated how the DNA of these Ethiopian individuals relates to DNA from thousands of additional present-day individuals sampled across the world (some collected as part of this project, and others publicly available). In particular we showed how some DNA of different Ethiopian groups is closely related to that found among peoples in west Africa (Sierra Leone, Nigeria) and Yemen, and determined that ancestors of these different world-wide groups intermixed in the past. By dating when this intermixing occurred, our analyses show how these genetic links could be related to the historical migrations of peoples from west Africa and west Eurasia into present-day Ethiopia, e.g. enabled by the Kingdom of Axum and/or the migrations of Bantu-speaking peoples thousands of years ago. 

Overall we have curated a large collection of genome-wide DNA data for over 2000 individuals sampled from Ethiopia and the Sudans and surrounding regions, including parts of West Eurasia. This is now one of the current most comprehensive genome-wide data collections covering these parts of Africa. As noted above, these data are currently being analysed to explore the genetic history of these (and other) regions, both on our own and with collaborations including researchers from University of Tehran and Johannes Gutenburg University that are currently underway. For example, analysis of genetic information from Iran obtained through this project demonstrated how, relative to other modern Iranian groups, the DNA of Iranian Zoroastrians is similar to that found in an Iranian farmer that lived ~10,000 years ago (DOI:10.1126/science.aaf7943). Furthermore, as these regions of Africa cover the likely routes by which modern humans would have first left Africa, the PDRA (Dr. Saioa Lopez) and I have written a review article on the current genetic and archaeological evidence on mysteries surrounding these initial migrations out-of-Africa (DOI: 10.4137/EBO.S33489).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As part of our 9 lecture tours across Ethiopia, we gave a radio interview (105.3 Afro FM) and distributed 500 pamphlets intended for lay (English-speaking) audiences, that explained the results of our studies into the genetic structure and ancestral history of Ethiopian peoples. These pamphlets were distributed to audience members (academic and non-academic), participants who provided DNA for this study, and libraries across Ethiopia. We hope that this information will provide a greater understanding to the academic and public sectors in Ethiopia about how DNA can be used to trace our ancestry, and how different Ethiopian ethnic groups are related genetically to one another. Our detailed discussions with academic and non-academic audience members following our lectures suggested we changed opinions and perceptions on how DNA evidence can contribute to aspects of Ethiopian history. Through collaboration with our contacts in Ethiopia, we plan to disseminate these findings further. For example, one of the original aims of the Ethiopian sample collection was to enable forthcoming studies to identify genetic variants associated with disease risk, which require a detailed understanding of the genetic structure of Ethiopian peoples. We have now provided this genetic information and are in discussions with Ethiopian academics to help them write future grants to perform such genetic association studies.

Furthermore, our newly genotyped data collection, perhaps the most comprehensive collection of genome-wide DNA from African individuals in terms of number of different ethnic groups sampled (and certainly the most comprehensive collection of samples from Ethiopia and the Sudans) will be made freely available to academics upon publication of our first paper analysing these data. Our review paper on the initial migrations of humans out of Africa, which was assessed by nine different reviewers, provides a comprehensive collation and summary of the literature on genetic and archaeological findings on this vital aspect of human history. DNA from Iranian individuals included as part of this grant has already been made freely available to academics, upon our publication of a paper comparing this DNA to that of the world's first farmers from the Fertile Crescent. This latter analysis showed, for the first time, how two very genetically different groups of people in the Fertile Crescent were nonetheless both agriculturalists, perhaps demonstrating how farming technology was transferred among ancient communities without involving the large-scale genetic intermixing of these groups.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D8FE0CFE-A66B-45DC-86DF-43F8C9912982</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545baf910df018.63985766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>distribution of 500 pamphlets (about genetic structure and history of Ethiopian peoples) to academics and lay audiences in Ethiopia</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B26B20E-6075-46F9-AD52-29FB2D6633FB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c83a1c18f9c3.65825862</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have currently genotyped 2184 samples from over 200 ethnic groups sampled across Africa, including 113 groups from Ethiopia and the Sudans, as part of the BBSRC grant.
