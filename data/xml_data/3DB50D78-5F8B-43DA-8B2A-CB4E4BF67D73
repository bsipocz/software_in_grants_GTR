Can institutions and regulations which address issues of equity for low-paid workers be part of an integrated competitive national strategy? While the market-led approach views labour market regulations and institutions as ?rigidities? which reduce flexibility and distort efficiency, an institutional approach recognises the role they can play in enhancing long-run dynamic efficiency.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>Drawing on the experiences of three small economies - Denmark, Ireland and New Zealand - over the past 25 years, the study shows that the relationship between efficiency and equity is complex and certain institutional mechanisms play vital economic functions. In particular, institutions for building and maintaining cooperation and coordination prove important for providing consensus, stability and the public goods essential for building a high-wage, high-productivity economy, while also promoting important social outcomes. The study also looks at the nature of institutional change and the extent to which the social partners can innovate and develop new institutional structures for cooperation and coordination. While change is possible, significant ideological divisions prevent new institutional forms from becoming deeply embedded.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31968</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My research was cited in a number of in-depth media analyses in the New Zealand Herald on the national minimum wage.

For small open economies, deregulation and neo-liberalism are not essential components of a successful economy. Rather, dialogue and social inclusion are important for building cohesion and providing legitimacy for change in a period of rapid economic adjustment. Moreover, not only can economic competitive pressures be addressed through a range of institutional approaches, but the neo-liberal prescription is not a very effective model for small economies attempting to build 'high road' national competitive strategies. Ireland has developed strong social partnership relationships at the national level underpinned by dialogue, deliberation and a shared vision of a high-wage, high-productivity economy. More recently New Zealand has begun to do the same. However, in both cases, there are few of the coordination mechanisms present in Denmark to deliver a range of important collective goods, such as training. Instead, voluntarist approaches are adopted. However, because these fail to overcome a significant ideological divide between the social partners below the national level, where neo-liberal management thinking predominates, there is only a limited diffusion of the 'high road' vision to workplace level. This is particularly so in low-paid sectors where the research found evidence of industries trapped in a low-wage, low-skills, and low-productivity equilibrium despite high levels of public policy support.

The ESRC fellowship provided the opportunity for the theoretical arguments to be further developed drawing on the work of Frank Wilkinson, Peter Brosnan and Simon Deakin on the efficiency-enhancing impacts of minimum wage regulations, and the work of Simon Deakin on 'reflexive governance'. The fellowship also enabled the researcher to disseminate the findings at a number of conferences and seminars, and prepare several papers/chapters for journal submission.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The fellowship laid the foundations for an on-going research agenda that has been pursued by the researcher.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CE8F3ED5-E318-435D-AD3A-2263E0588705</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464824840e645.18256177</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>18A494FC-57D5-4AB8-AD3D-B2E3F92BDBEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Productivity-Enhancing Impacts of the Minimum Wage: Lessons from Denmark and New Zealand</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Journal of Industrial Relations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6b54de41670af36a8f13ef274003ab37"><gtr:id>6b54de41670af36a8f13ef274003ab37</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McLaughlin C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfb9fb960aa2fe</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>820FB30E-48D7-458F-981B-E7C0A15F9244</gtr:id><gtr:title>Employment Relationships: Workers, Unions and Employers in New Zealand</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/99bcc44befa8af042305887396af4b42"><gtr:id>99bcc44befa8af042305887396af4b42</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McLaughlin, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781869404499</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-6776185191.0279923b9bdd3c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF513344-A53F-41C9-8287-D840FA97C7EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of productivity coalitions in building a &amp;acirc;??high road&amp;acirc;?? competitive strategy: The case of Denmark and Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Industrial Relations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6b54de41670af36a8f13ef274003ab37"><gtr:id>6b54de41670af36a8f13ef274003ab37</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McLaughlin C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463771c7836f0.59585966</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">PTA-026-27-1142</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
