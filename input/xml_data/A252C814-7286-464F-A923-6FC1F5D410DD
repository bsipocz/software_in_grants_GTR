Cosmopolitanism, derived from the ancient Greek for 'world citizenship', offers a radical alternative to the ideology of nationalism, asking individuals to imagine themselves as part of a global community that goes beyond national and linguistic boundaries. The 1890s witnessed a widespread public debate on cosmopolitanism: in Britain and throughout Europe, this period saw a clash between ideologies of trans-national cooperation and universalism, partly promoted by modern transport and communication technologies, and the rising nationalism that would culminate in the First World War. 

My research will show that the 1890s controversy around cosmopolitanism, largely uncharted so far, is a shaping influence on the literary culture of this decade which has long been recognised as a crucial turning point in literary history. Promoters of literary cosmopolitanism questioned the supposedly fundamental link between literature, national identity, and national language: they deliberately sought out the strange and foreign in their works in order to create new ways of reading and writing that crossed boundaries between languages and literary genres as much as between different nations. These practices were denounced as politically and morally suspect by the detractors of cosmopolitanism, who stressed the responsibilities of literature towards local communities and the nation. I aim to show that a nuanced and historically-accurate understanding of the debate on comopolitanism transforms our understanding of the literary culture of the fin de si&amp;egrave;cle, allowing us to move beyond the categories of decadence, impressionism, and symbolism that have dominated the critical tradition. In order to do so, I concentrate on authors who embrace the cosmopolitan ideal but are also careful to define what is at stake in the controversy surrounding it. My monograph will therefore be divided into five chapters that examine, respectively: Oscar Wilde; George Egerton (Mary Dunne Bright); Ouida (Maria Louise Ram&amp;eacute;); John Addington Symonds and Havelock Ellis; and Henry James. Drawing mainly on articles in the periodical press, the introduction will aim to reconstruct the meaning and associations of the term 'cosmopolitanism' for readers in the 1890s, teasing out its literary implications; while the conclusion will relate the 1890s debate on cosmopolitanism to our current discussion about global/local identities. 

My case studies have been chosen in order to break down existing distinctions between canonical and marginal writers, 'high' and popular literature, male and female authorship. I will show that the debate on cosmopolitanism involved authors and readerships with very different aesthetic and political agendas. Each chapter draws both on published and archival material in order to piece together literary networks that connect English works from this period with a range of French, Scandinavian, Italian, and German sources. A particularly original aspect of my approach is the emphasis on gender: I argue that politically and socially marginalised groups such as women and homosexual men were drawn to the cosmopolitan ideal as a utopian path towards artistic and personal freedom; and conversely, that cosmopolitanism, with its attack on traditional models of national identity, generated new ways of understanding the body, gender, and sexual identities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My research on cosmopolitanism addresses fundamental questions about identity that are of vital importance beyond the academic research community: it investigates how the individual relates to the concepts of nationality, citizenship, and community. The cosmopolitan ideal asks women and men to think of themselves as belonging to a broad trans-national order of equals with shared values, rights, and obligations. In the post-war period, this ideal has found a political and institutional embodiment in the United Nations and, more recently, the European Union. Both these institutions, which represent the triumph of the cosmopolitan ideal as bringer of peace and democracy, are experiencing a crisis, as they are challenged in their ability to respond to the needs and aspirations of individuals across the globe. 

Policy-makers at national and trans-national level can benefit from my research in order to enhance their understanding of what is at stake for the individual in embracing the cosmopolitan ideal. My research into the 1890s shows that the literary, political, civic, legal, and institutional aspects of cosmopolitanism are inextricably bound within one another. In our age of ever-increasing trans-national traffic, individuals are called upon to reconfigure their allegiances: as the world 'gets smaller' and human interconnection across national, ethnic, and religious divides gets bigger, individuals and communities are forced to renegotiate the conflicting claims of the local and global dimensions of their identity. My research shows that authors in the 1890s already felt that their own modernity forced a 'global' identity on them (although of course they did not have access to this word), and reveals a long history of globalisation that is often ignored in the public discussion. In other words, it aims to demonstrate that a deep and historically-nuanced understanding of the controversy over cosmopolitanism in the 1890s generates new ways of understanding the moral and political debates that characterise the phenomena of globalisation and multiculturalism today.

I therefore hope that my research will also have an impact on how the media discuss issues of local/global identity in a multicultural society, within and beyond the UK. In the UK, the debate over what constitutes a modern British identity, and what values and obligations should be attached to that, has been particularly intense in the last few decades, largely as a result of mass immigration. In particular, my fellowship would fall within a period that is likely to witness an increasing amount of debate on the question of British identity within Europe. The Prime Minister has recently promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, in order to give electors the opportunity to determine the place of Britain within the EU. The public discussion about this topic already proliferates in the media, on the internet, and in social networks. In political terms, hostility to the cosmopolitan project represented by European integration reveals the fear that transnational and supranational organisations fail to connect with the individual. On the cultural plane, it translates into an anxiety about loss of identity and the erasure of cultural difference. My research into 1890s cosmopolitanism aims to generate knowledge about identity that is highly transferrable to the present, and that will benefit people involved in making practical decisions as well as helping the larger public understand, for instance, what is at stake in embracing a British and/or European identity and how far each of these can be said to enhance, compensate, or exclude the other.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>181487</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>IN2P3 CNRS</gtr:department><gtr:description>The transnational Literary Field</gtr:description><gtr:id>99BA3E86-9156-4A13-89FE-94C6FED86F7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two international workshops.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c12ab4b7fa77.73672636-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Seeing up workshop, graduate training, sharing ongoing research, sharing methodological expertise with international research leaders in the field.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Setting up workshop, graduate training, sharing ongoing research and methodological expertise.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Humboldt University of Berlin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for British Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mapping Europe conference</gtr:description><gtr:id>A74698BC-0055-450B-8796-9CB744970CC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing international exchange.

In the initial period of my fellowship I was invited to give a talk on British cosmopolitanism in the 1890s by the Centre for British Studies of the Humboldt University, Berlin, as part of their 'Monday Lectures' - a series of public talks which are attended by members of the general public, including journalists, and where - these were the days before the UE referendum - my presentation sparked a lively debate. The Centre for British Studies has since then hosted other important debates on Britain in the EU, becoming a key forum for such discussions in Germany. The Berlin lecture has then triggered two more invitations to talk about literary cosmopolitanism in Germany, in front of international audiences. 

After the EU referendum and in the context of redefining a British identity within Europe - from the cultural, social and political points of view - politicians are asking the public to think about their individual identities and loyalties. Explicitly invoking the idea of cosmopolitanism (i.e. world citizenship) Theresa May controversially stated that 'If you think you're a citizen of the world, you're a citizen of nowhere'. My research tries to promote a nuanced understanding of the cultural, emotional and historical factors involved in the notions of national/transnational citizenship. It shows that there need not be a conflict between national and cosmopolitan loyalties. The outcomes of the international conference 'Cosmopolis and Beyond' which I held in Oxford in March 2016 as part of my AHRC-funded project are now accessible for free via the Oxford iTunes web pages (https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/cosmopolis-and-beyond-literary-cosmopolitanism-after-republic-letters), where they can be accessed by the general public. A feature on my project, outlining its potential impact beyond academia, has recently been put up by the AHRC website, where it can be read by anyone who is interested in this debate. Since then a similar feature has appeared on Trinity College Website and a feature to go on the Oxford English Faculty website is currently in preparation. News of the AHRC feature of my project was also tweeted extensively over the last couple of weeks. I hope that such increased visibility in the media will alert users beyond academia to the importance of gaining a historically nuanced understanding of notions of local/global citizenship, in these times where these issues are being extensively invoked by politicians, often in a simplified manner.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AD0C4B9A-D1C5-480F-9815-DA43DAC5E761</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7072d4a726.68514153</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main achievement of the award has been to generate new knowledge about literary cosmopolitanism in the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century. In my own research I have done so by investigating how a number of specific authors (Oscar Wilde, Lafcadio Hearn, George Egerton) engaged with the concept of cosmopolitanism in order to create new ways of writing and new understandings of how literature operates across borders; I have also investigated how the category of cosmopolitanism operates in fields that transcend traditional categories of authorship, e.g. the international periodical press and especially the press associated with the early artificial language movement of the end of the nineteenth century (volap&amp;uuml;k and esperanto), and sexological writings. In the course of this research the main findings that have emerged are:

* the end of the nineteenth century witnessed a wide-ranging debate on the meaning and value of cosmopolitanism that focused on the relationship between literary texts, individual identities and notions of citizenship
* literature became a widely-used and distinctive medium for the articulation of the cosmopolitan ideal
* certain authors became particularly associated with cosmopolitan and internationalist ideologies
* a focus on cosmopolitan practices enables us to recuperate otherwise marginal authors (e.g. Hearn) and discover their great importance as international mediators; or refocus our attention onto otherwise marginalised parts of a canonical author's production (e.g. Egerton's Scandinavian translations)
* cosmopolitanism, and its literary applications, were contested territories

Key to these findings is an ongoing commitment to improve our understanding of how cosmopolitanism operates within literature. There has been extensive research on cosmopolitanism in recent years in the fields of philosophy, politics and the social sciences. The work generating from my award aims to relate these fields to literary studies, and to investigate how cosmopolitanism can function as a specifically literary ideal and practice. My project has, as a result, generated high-level interdisciplinary discussions, e.g. between British-based literary scholars and the research group on literary sociology led by Prof Gis&amp;egrave;le Sapiro at the CNRS and EHESS Paris, which has already attracted further research funding. Two international graduate workshops held respectively in Birkbeck, University of London and Paris Nanterre, which I convened together with my former research assistant, Dr Cl&amp;eacute;ment Dessy, and colleagues from these institutions, have provided the platform for focused training of graduates in these new methodologies, as well as planting the seeds for future international collaborations among early-career researchers, who are developing new understandings of the national/international/transnational scope of literature both individually and collaboratively.

I engage with these key discoveries and new methodologies both in my own work (ongoing research towards a monograph on this topic, various book chapters and journal articles) and in a range of collaborative activities that have been instrumental for my research. The papers delivered at an international conference on literary cosmopolitanism I organised in Oxford in March 2016 are now available as podcasts that can be freely accessed via Oxford iTunes. The broader theoretical questions addressed by my research have acquired increased topicality after the EU referendum of June 2016 and in the current debate on Brexit. A feature on my project highlighting its impact potential was commissioned by the AHRC and has recently been added to their website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings highlight the fact that the debate on national/international identities that is very present in today's media have an historical precedent in the late nineteenth century and that an increased knowledge of how the debate was conducted in that period can help us focus our understanding of the present. Literature is an incredibly important medium for our understanding, and construction, of citizenship and individual identity: paying attention to how literature navigates its national, international and transnational dimensions can help us understand our own role(s) as individuals that necessarily participate both in national and larger international or global communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D2283C76-035F-4E21-9253-8CDE3A257F4B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7066ebd665.29087591</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/cosmopolis-beyond-literary/id1105928703?mt=10</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5CB65F87-5680-49D5-BD78-1F472C63465E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Les vies britanniques d'&amp;Eacute;mile Verhaeren</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Textyles</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/44f846662f94c3ab40698c4de4644473"><gtr:id>44f846662f94c3ab40698c4de4644473</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>dessy c</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6f284c8d741.23382779</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D0651A23-19D5-42F9-A875-0A6617EF7789</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Colours of the Past in Victorian Britain</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e939d2d94db4f3af0d93447a512df624"><gtr:id>e939d2d94db4f3af0d93447a512df624</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evangelista, S.M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9783035308273</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56df2ed12baea9.96320825</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77EFA8AC-76E6-4B9E-B70A-0EB1A2E5E3EA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Une esth&amp;eacute;tique de la rue.
