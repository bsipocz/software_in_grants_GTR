To facilitate this process, a research and information network will be established, The network will consist of researchers and members from groups within the community. The idea of monthly seminars/workshops will be explored; hopefully allowing exchange of research information and skills in research methods. The project has multiple aims, essentially around the development of better community engagement between university researchers and third sector. It is anticipated the collaboration will help to identify research priorities and appropriate methodologies and lead to co-production of knowledge.&lt;br />&lt;br />This approach, attempting to render research comprehensible and accessible to community groups gives the potential to 'spread the word' through the interactions of groups, and to maximise the social, economic and policy benefits of research. Additionally, this may allow academic researchers to use multiple methods of research dissemination and knowledge exchange, so research is easier to understand. This may also allow for the mainstreaming of research outcomes so they are not only on the periphery of community groups' work but also of use day-to-day. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Community groups within the third sector will benefit from enhanced community engagement strategies. The proposed seminar series will provide regular opportunities for their members to interact with researchers, to ask questions and to make suggestions to the research project, rendering the final outcomes of the research of more relevance to the community groups. If members are better able to understand the research and also take some ownership of it they will be more likely to use the evidence base to guide their work and to enhance their work for the community. 

Private sector groups that are in partnership with community groups, such as in social enterprises, will also benefit. Engagement with research will mean that the community group is sourcing credible and reliable information and will be more likely receive funding to continue with partnership working. 

There are opportunities also for the public sector to benefit, with initial key participants detailed in the Case for Support. The means of co-production of knowledge could assist practitioners and policymakers in adapting or producing policies that would be of greater relevance and practical implementation for community group members.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6750</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poolside Guardian Issue 3</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F2E86C8-56FD-4065-8414-CC600146DE65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is newsletter produced by a local community group, and the research network is mentioned in this issue.
