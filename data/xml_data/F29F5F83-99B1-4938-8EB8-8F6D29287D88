Buxtorf was a prolific scholar whose dictionaries and grammars of the Hebrew language were reprinted for centuries after his death. Our study will produce a fresh appraisal of Buxtorf by attempting to discover how he arrived at his mastery of Hebrew, Aramaic and Yiddish as well as of a vast range of Jewish texts; how he obtained Jewish books and information about Jewish and other topics from a network of correspondents; and whether his extremely negative attitudes towards contemporary Jews fluctuated in the course of his life. In order to obtain this knowledge we will concentrate our research on Buxtorf's surviving copybook (Basel University Library AXII 20) which reveals precious information about his method of extracting from texts, notes on conversations with Jewish informants and his extraordinary expertise in delving into the alien texts of Jewish tradition.\nBy analysing the copybook with other surviving materials such as letters, and the annotated books of his own library (many of which are in Basel) and comparing these with his printed works we hope to reach a better understanding of a major figure in the cultural history of early modern Europe. In doing so, the study should also help articulate a restatement and redefinition of the nature of Hebraism in early modern Europe.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will include theologians and religious leaders who are involved in ecumenical dialogue and debate and seek to base their discussions not on vague concepts of belief and religious identity but rather on the empirical facts as gained from a study of the history of Jewish-Christian interaction and the central issues that perennially arise from it. From scrutiny of Buxtorf's copybook the complex nature of his anti-Hebraism becomes evident. It is this complicated religious dilemma that confronts the reader of Buxtorf's work that could enable theologians and religious leaders and those engaged in Jewish-Christian encounter to reassess their understanding of the history of religious prejudice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59341</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>lecture on Johann Buxtorf in southampton University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0161DCE-24AB-4C0B-B988-B2A300FF42B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave this talk at the semianr in Jewish studies at Southampton University that draws an audience from people connected the society for Jewish-Christian relations</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d33a5fa87b00.35507068</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Key-note lecture on the subject of my grant</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>77EFF710-91E6-4CEB-85F3-949466237AF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a major lecture but not followed by questions.

In addition, these findings have been presented to professional scholars in the Early Modern Culture.
In addition, I presented the materials to a general audience in one of the most important synagogues in Philadelphia, USA.
I also delivered a paper on my findings to young doctoral students in Oxford who were excited by the subject that I presented.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5EB0EA12-C071-4E7F-9B67-744650EAD99C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546482daddb0c6.95013545</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have discovered the nature of religious polemic (in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century through examination of a great individual's copybook (Johann Buxtorf).
