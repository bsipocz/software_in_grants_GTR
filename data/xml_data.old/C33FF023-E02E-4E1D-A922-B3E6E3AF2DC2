Whilst work has been done to explore the implications of Equalities legislation, including contesting the normalisations of neo-liberalisms, there has yet to be an investigation into what might make every day spaces liveable for LGBTQ people. This project addresses social exclusion, not only through identifying exclusions, but also by exploring how life might become liveable in everyday places in two very different contexts.
In 2013 the Marriage (Same Sex) Act passed in the UK, and in India the Delhi High Court's reading down Indian Penal Code 377 in 2009 to decriminalize sexual acts between consenting same-sex people was overturned by the Supreme Court. Yet bullying, mental health and safety continue to be crucial to understanding British LGBTQ lives, in contrast the overturned the revoke of Penal Code 377 2013, this has resulted in increased visibilities of LGBTQ people. These different contexts are used to explore liveable lives as more than lives that are just 'bearable' and moves beyond norms of happiness and wellbeing.
This research refuses to be fixed to understanding social liberations through the exclusion/inclusion, in place/out of place dichotomies. Using commonplace to move beyond 'in place' towards being common to the place itself. Place can then be shared in common as well as collectively made in ways that do not necessarily impose normative agendas/regulatory conditionalities. Social liberations are examined in the transformation of everyday encounters without conforming to hegemonies or making 'normal' our own.
Whilst the focus is sexual and gender liberations, the project will enable considerations of others social differences. It will show how places produce differential liveabilities both where legislative change has been achieved and where it has just been repealed. Thus, the project offers academic and policy insights into safety, difference and vibrant and fair societies.
The study will use a 7 phase mixed methods design:
1. Project planning and research design, including formally establishing the advisory group and meeting 1, setting milestones and setting in place all agreements/ethical approvals
2. Literature review exploring key measures used to rate and assess LGBTQ 'friendliness'/inclusion nationally, supra-nationally and internationally
3. A spatial assessment of LGBTQ liveabilities that includes, but moves beyond, the measures identified in phase 2, applying these at a local scale e.g. policy indicators and place based cultural indicators 
4. Twenty focus groups (80 participants, sample targeting marginalised LGBTQ people), coupled with online qualitative questionnaires (150), and shorter SMS text questionnaires (200)/App responses (200) to identify add to the liveability index created in phase 3 and what makes life un/liveable for a range of LGBTQ people and how this varies spatially
5. Participants in the data collection will be invited to reconfigure place through UK/India street theatre performances. These will be video recorded, edited into one short video and widely distributed. Data will be collected by observing interactions; on the spot audience surveys; reflections on the event 
6. The research will analyse the data sets as they are collected. At the end of the data collection phase time will be taken to look across all 4 data sets to create a liveability index 
7. Research dissemination will be targeted at community and academic audiences, including end of project conferences in India/UK, collating policy/community reports, academic outputs.
The impact plan details the short (transnational support systems; empowerment of participants), medium (policy changes, inform practice) and long-term (changing perceptions of LGBTQ people) social impacts and how these will be achieved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most important beneficiaries of this research will be LGBTQ communities in India and the UK. The impacts of this research will also be felt by policy makers, community groups/NGOs, police and safety services and non-LGBTQ people and the liveability model in the longer-term could change the ways in which equalities/inclusion are assessed. These beneficiaries and a summary of the impacts will be addressed in turn. 
Collaborators from LGBTQ communities will be involved from the outset on the advisory group for this research and will be tasked with ensuring that the research actions reflect the ethos of co-working and empowerment of marginalised groups. Activists on the advisory group through transnational dialogue will create shared knowledges, engage in mutual learning and develop new transnational support systems, such as networking, sharing painful experiences and receiving support/advice from those in very different contexts. The liveability measure will be created with LGBTQ people to establish what makes life liveable and this will be used to inform street theatre which aims to change the perceptions of unsafe/uncomfortable places. Throughout the research and impact activities, the focus will be on how to make LGBTQ lives more liveable.
The creation of a liveability measure has the potential to make a significant contribution to how 'equalities' and 'inclusions' are measured, moving beyond tick boxes towards meaningful measures that account for multiple differences and spatial variations nationally as well as cross-nationally. This aims to broaden understanding of social exclusions and how these might be tackled. Broad use of the liveability measure has the potential to address issues of social difference, fairness and social cohesion. This has significant policy implications in terms of how legislation is implemented and equality and diversity practically manifest, improving policy and practices to address social exclusion and create just societies. 
Policy reports and community summaries will use the liveability measure to rethink how social justice agendas are defined. The liveability measure and the outcomes of street theatre will provide evidence and new thinking to NGOs and community groups regarding the inclusion of diverse LGBTQ people in their work and how this may relate to social justice goals. 
For the police and safety services in India and the UK the liveability measure will provide new information as well as build and extend on other research that explores bullying, harassment, violence, suicidal harm and safety. It enables a reconsideration of safety initiatives that seek to address homophobic, biphobic and transphobic hate crime, looking to prevent hate crime alongside reporting agendas. For example, it will seek to directly address sexual harassment in public spaces and thus looking to prevent such harassment beyond reporting to law enforcement agencies. 
Further beneficiaries will be non-LGBTQ people who will be given means of encountering LGBTQ people as commonplace. The project aims to initially momentarily change the perceptions of LGBTQ people. This will be achieved in part through street theatre. It seeks to develop greater appreciation of the challenges and possibilities of social difference and how to encounter difference differently, through the video of the street theatre performances on social media outlets- with the aim of eliciting further responses and engagements. In addition it is hoped that spin off events will be encouraged through the coverage of the street theatre and distribution of the final video. Harnessing social media will be done with an explicit attempt to engage people in making public spaces open to difference beyond law enforcement/criminalisation.

The question asked was:
To ask the Minister for Women and Equalities, with reference to the report, Acting on equalities: are local authorities in England meeting the duties of the Equality Act 2010 and addressing sexual orientation and gender equality, published by the University of Brighton in October 2016, what steps she is taking to address the finding of that report that in 2016 over half of local authorities in England were failing to demonstrate compliance with the specific public sector duties of the Equality Act 2010 and associated Government Equalities Office Guidance.

The response was: 
The Equality and Human Rights Commission is the regulator for the public sector equality duty set out in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010. The Commission uses a range of levers to ensure local authorities and other public bodies comply with the requirements of the duty, from provision of guidance through to enforcement activity where it considers there to be a strategic benefit.
In light of the Brighton University report highlighted by the Honourable Member, the Commission will be writing to the Local Government Association (LGA) drawing its attention to the findings of the research and of the Commission's evidence of the key equality challenges facing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and asking the LGA to remind local authorities of their legal obligations under the public sector equality duty.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>587cb0dfcf1b87.85570885</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2016-12-02/56000/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Street Theatre Workshop (Kolkata)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>42A217E5-5CB5-4442-9A21-3D9BCD0FF0B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>tHe street theatre workshops were held over a series of weeks in Kolkata, building community, trust and comradeship.

This report will cover key audiences and the differences that this research has made, both in terms of process and findings. This research concluded on the 31st January 2017 and the full impact of this research is still being realised. Further annual reports will highlight the ongoing ways that the research is being used. Here we detail the short-term and some medium term impacts.

International engagements with measures of LGBT friendliness: This research has augmented the call for robust measures of LGBTI inclusions transnationally. It has been used by ILGA World, a worldwide federation that campaigns for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex rights, working with the United Nations and their Development Projects.

National policy implementation: In the process of undertaking the data collection into UK local authorities' adherence to the Equality Act 2010, some councils who were contacted asked for support in developing their adherence to the legislation. They subsequently changed their available information, with some developing work around the area. The first report to examine the Public-Sector Duties associated with the Act resulted in a question asked in Parliament regarding its findings. This lead to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission writing to all local authorities to ensure their adherence to the legislation. 

Activism and wellbeing: Local and transnational activisms have been developed and enhanced through this project. Through this project those who worked on it as activists (as well as academics) discussed how their lives were made more liveable though the process of the research. This included members of the research team, steering group and those attending workshops. For some in both India and the UK, these groups were amongst the first contacts they had with LGBTQ people and groups such as Sappho for Equality. For Sappho for Equality this lead to contact with new people, who in turn received support from this organisation and joined its activities. Furthermore, through the process of collecting together news articles regarding the prosecution of LGBTQ people, Sappho for Equality's archives were significantly expanded upon, including indexing in ways that made the material more accessible and useable. This enables access to this unique collection and developed understandings of activisms and LGBTQ histories across India. It also supported Sappho for Equality's work in campaigning and advocacy. Finally, this project developed innovative and unique interactions across India and the UK. Through a web-based app interface, LGBTQ people were able to engage in conversations on discussion boards around issues of shared interest. This created a temporary and transient community that has significant further potential. Participants were also asked to offer public facing videos about what makes their lives liveable. These were tweeted and shared on the website and social media. Conferences in India and the UK gave activists and academics the opportunity to engage with each other through the preliminary findings of the project. These were well attended and generated significant discussions of key issues, as well as conversations and collaborations around future activities and collaborations within and beyond research. One of the participants in the UK conference subsequently tweeted that it was: 'One of the most impactful LGBTIQ related events I've ever been to'.

Public perceptions: This project sought to experiment with momentarily changing public space and from this addressing attitudes to LGBTQ lives, through street theatre. Formed through street theatre workshops, in the UK, the experiment with change in street theatre performances took the form of recognising ongoing difficulties in LGBTQ lives. In India, it focused on awareness and visibility. The transnational film I Script, My Script illustrated the various approaches and challenges of participants and public engagement with street theatre workshops and performances. It also demonstrated the changes that street theatre can make, as evidenced by the police officer interviewed about repealing Indian anti-homosexuality legislation at the end of the Kolkata street theatre:
Policeman: I understood the subject Everyone is talking about this. We should think about it

Public perceptions were also affected by news coverage of the lack of compliance with legal public sector duties and coverage of project (including appearances on LGBTQ and mainstream media including magazine and radio coverage).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BB328E8B-EE37-4A5B-AA85-073FC87152F3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56be421e448988.46507741</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research objectives: To move beyond the analysis of exclusion/inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) communities in the UK and India and explore how, when and where lives become un/liveable for LGBTQ people.
Finding 1: In considering liveability in an empirical sense through LGBTQ lives, key breakthroughs are:
? Rights, legislative changes and equality laws are important, but they may not create liveable lives. When examining how lives are lived in the UK and India, it was clear that what makes lives liveable related to, but was not determined by, equalities legislation (or conversely discriminatory legislation). 
? Liveability is spatially and temporally created. Liveabilities differ between people and over a person's lifecourse. What makes life liveable at one point in the lifecourse may be different to what makes life liveable at another point. There are geographies to liveabilities that include, and move beyond, Global North/Global South divides. 
? Liveability is felt rather than being measurable. We would caution against developing global measures of liveabilities, focusing instead on social transformation that is contextually nuanced, yet transnationally connected. 
? Liveability is communal. People can be central to making life liveable as well as not liveable - and community, friendships and family can make life liveable and not liveable. Thus, dealing with people as individuals will not be sufficient. 
? Making your life liveable does not necessarily make you happy. Working for social change and undertaking activism is hard. Being an LGBTQ person may take away other important structures of 'happy' lives (such as family and friends), and yet still make life more liveable.
? What makes life liveable for LGBTQ people is partially determined by their gender and sexual identities. Liveability about lives, and being LGBTQ is one part of this. This is a very important part for some, even though they know there is more. For others, they understand and experience their sexual and gender identities as accepted and 'fine', and so this isn't seen as a 'big part' of improving their lives.
Finding 2: Currently there is no academic transnational analysis or comparison between nations that explores the state of LGBTQ rights, equalities and lives. One NGO produces 'rainbow maps' focused mainly on legislative discrimination. Yet, government decisions regarding aid can be made by labelling countries as homophobic due to specific legislations. This may not evenly address the abuse, discrimination and prejudice as they are manifest in people's lives and requires further research. 
Finding 3: The implementation of legislation is uneven within countries. In the UK, mandatory equalities legislation regarding sexual orientation and gender identity (Equality Act 2010) was not only unevenly implemented by local authorities, but some were failing to implement the legislation. Two data collection points showed a decline in adherence to legislation over time. In India, IPC377 did have discernible effects on LGBTQ politics, but this was not operationalized in the same way in different places across the country. 
Finding 4: Working transnationally can contest the imperative for comparability. Street theatre workshops also provided innovative data as well as significant impact.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? Academics: This is the first piece of research to take on a conceptually informed empirical engagement with liveability (as distinct from survival), and beyond juridico-political frames. There is much to be done to develop these findings, and to consider how they might be applied to reconsider our engagements with equalities, social justice, and indeed what the aims of sexual- and gender-related activisms might be. 
Further transnational conceptual work will explore what liveability means. To this end we are developing theory regarding inclusion/exclusion through a series of papers, the first of which addresses happiness. This is ongoing as we develop theoretical inferences from the data and work towards a co-authored book. It is anticipated that this work will be taken up by others to explore the limitations of equalities and the complexities of inclusion, as well as developing thinking regarding operationalising transnational participatory research. 

? Policy Makers: Politicians, policy makers and those in charge of ensuring policy compliance/non-compliance are well-placed to make use of this research. Advocating and campaigning for LGBTQ people at all scales of engagement could be augmented by the project's non-comparative approach, critiques of legislation-focused efforts, and identification of social relationships as crucial to LGBTQ liveability.

? Activists: Activist groups could develop these findings in their own work. Sappho for Equality now speak of 'liveability' when considering positive social change. It is likely that this term will increase in use as it becomes increasingly clear that there is a need to develop more robust approaches, and a new language for social progress, with regards to genders and sexualities. 

? General Public: This project addresses a need to develop improved transnational understandings of sexual and gender difference and how this is lived in the UK and India. Through public lectures, as well as other public engagements, such as radio shows, this project's work will feed into developing public perceptions that question the understanding of nations as either 'progressive' or 'backward'. This task is crucial to developing more socially cohesive societies in globalised contexts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4B3F8BE7-261F-4832-A3E1-D1EC58666454</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c4deb20b1610.54645570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.liveablelives.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Changes to the Implementation of LGBT policies in Local Cocunils in England</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78720668-1B53-45F9-B276-7B4D672291C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Due to the process of collecting data regarding the implementation of the Equality ACT 2010 on local governments in England, several changed their website and information available to the public.
