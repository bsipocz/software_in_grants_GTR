Air pollution is the largest environmental root of ill-health and premature loss of life. Each year it causes over 4 million deaths, with 90% of these in developing countries. Air pollution stems both from anthropogenic activities as well as a variety of natural sources. In the developing countries air pollution is generally poorly understood due to lack of scientific research and routine monitoring. Furthermore, while public air quality (AQ) alerts and advisories are legally mandated in the UK and other high-income countries, they are almost non-existent in the poorest parts of the world. The World Health Organisation therefore recommends that monitoring of air pollution is improved in the developing countries to better understand the impact it has on health, and to assist local authorities in establishing plans for improving AQ. 

In a previous research project, our team looked at a poorly understood source of air pollution from persistently active volcanoes, using Masaya volcano in Nicaragua as a case study. Volcanic air pollution (VAP) is a chronic natural hazard potentially present in over 30 countries on the Official Development Assistance list but absent from their mitigation strategies. Almost nothing is known about the interaction of VAP with anthropogenic air pollution and the resulting impacts on health and the environment. Our previous project developed and trialled a system for monitoring VAP and assessed ways of making the system suitable for operational use. This new system can be used for monitoring AQ both from volcanoes and other sources, including anthropogenic activities such as traffic.

We will install a network of permanent AQ stations that will stream data in real-time to the Nicaraguan natural hazards observatory. We will also introduce techniques and tools for visualising and interpret the data. Nicaragua already has a well-developed system for monitoring and mitigating a number of other natural hazards, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunami. The AQ network will be integrated with the pre-existing system and used alongside monitoring of other hazards. We will be collaborating with the Nicaraguan natural hazards observatory, the civil protection, and multiple other local and international end-users.

The AQ data will be used to make forecasts and issue public advisories for unhealthy air pollution levels. Public advisories allow the decision makers and the public to take measures to protect the most vulnerable persons, such as people with respiratory and heart conditions, children and the elderly. AQ monitoring also increases the awareness of decision makers and the public on air pollution issues, and is therefore an important initial step towards improving AQ in the country. We will be working closely with the local communities to ensure that the public advisories are applicable, easily understandable, and useful for their lifestyle. At the end of the project, the local end-users, such as the natural hazards observatory, will have the necessary capability and knowledge to run the AQ network and expand it as needed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>UNRESP-OPS will build the capacity to monitor, forecast and mitigate the hazard posed by air pollution. An air quality (AQ) monitoring system will be integrated in Nicaragua's pre-existing network for natural hazards. Nicaragua has reached the stage of development which allows it to have a robust and resilient disaster risk management system, and will be able to benefit immediately from having the capability of a reliable AQ monitoring system we have developed and trialled in a GCRF Building Resilience foundation phase project UNRESP 2016-2017.

WHO will benefit from this research and HOW:

1. Instituto Nicarag&amp;uuml;ense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER): a key end-user project partner that will be involved in all stages of the project. INETER is the government institute in Nicaragua responsible for monitoring and issuing of early warning of natural hazards. UNRESP-OPS will develop the capability of INETER to forecast, monitor and issue public advisories for air pollution, as well as to increase the awareness of the government to this hazard

2. Nicaraguan civil protection and civil defence authorities: UNRESP-OPS will help strengthening the coordination of institutional actions for hazard management through introducing forecasting, monitoring and communication of AQ monitoring system and public advisories. 
 
3. Ministerio de Salud (MINSA): Health Ministry of Nicaragua is responsible for providing health services (free at the point of use) and promoting lifestyles that contribute to improving the life quality and life expectancy. UNRESP-OPS contributes to work of MINSA by advancing resilience to air pollution which is a hazard highly pertinent to human health. This aids disease and disability prevention and frees up much-needed resources. 

4. City of Managua, capital of Nicaragua. The city authorities have recognized the importance of monitoring air quality. The AQ system will cover the city of Managua to provide real-time data on air quality, as well as public advisries to its inhabitants. 

5. Local communities, authorities and medical services in regions impacted by volcanic air pollution (VAP). UNRESP-OPS will have an immediate effect by providing forecasting, monitoring and public advisories of VAP levels to the local residents that are tailored to their lifestyle. 

6. Ministerio del Ambiente y los Recursos Naturales (MARENA): the National Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources regulates the conservation and responsible use of natural resources and operates Nicaragua's protected areas, including the Masaya Volcano National Park, one of the most popular tourist destinations. UNRESP-OPS will provide forecasts and public advisories of how Masaya volcano affects air quality within the national park to provide a safer experience for both the park staff and visitors. 

7. Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO). The project will strengthen the advice and support PAHO gives Latin American countries in health emergencies such as volcanic air pollution crises. 

8. Volcano observatories, decision makers and the public in other countries dealing with VAP. VAP hazard may be present in over 30 countries on the Overseas Development Aid list. UNRESP-OPS will facilitate knowledge-exchange collaborations between INETER and decision making institutes in other countries which deal with this hazard.

9. The International Volcanic Health Hazard Network (IVHHN) is an umbrella organisation for all research and information on volcanic health hazards. The information and recommendations on mitigating and communicating volcanic air pollution hazard in Nicaragua will be made available via the IVHHN website and appropriate mailing lists.

10. The global DRR sector. We contribute to the overall Sendai Framework put in place by the UNISDR on the general task of enhancing disaster preparedness based on knowledge found in impacted communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R009465/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
