The construction de novo of large and complex genetic circuits or metabolic pathways will enable us to for example, program stem cell differentiation, detect multiple changes in cancer cells, or engineer cell factories to produce completely novel drugs or greener chemicals and biofuels. The conventional approach of engineering cells at the bench is inherently slow and expensive. Automation and industrialization reduce development time and the economies of scale of medium to high throughput processes can reduce the cost of organism development democratising the endeavour and allowing an expansion in the number of academic groups and industries that can undertake such complex organism engineering. 
To realise our ambitions for synthetic biology we need enabling technologies that can not only provide robust, reliable and cost effective methodologies for the design, construction and incorporation of synthetic DNA we need to understand the interaction of the component or pathway with the host and capture holistic datasets that report back on synthetic part and pathway performance, cell growth and health.
The initial BBSRC investment (BBM00029X1 andBBM00094X1) has helped found two DNA synthesis centres, the Edinburgh Genome Foundry (EGF, based in the School of Biological Sciences) and Liverpool GeneMill (LGM, based within the Centre for Genomic Research CGR) offering DNA design, synthesis and validation of large gene constructs (up to 1Mbp). However, we need to further expand our capabilities to include high throughput assay development suited to assessing whether the DNA construct delivers the desired output (i.e. phenotype) in the host cell. Here we request support for capital equipment that will enable us to set up multi parallel medium throughput assays for cell health, function and productivity. Alongside these platforms we build the software tools for automation and analysis, together with software to integrate this data with the design and fabrication pipelines. This will provide the data needed to inform the future design of refined DNA constructs, accelerate the design build test cycle, improve efficiency and reduce the cost of application of synthetic biology applications. Ultimately this will help drive growth of the markets than can benefit from synthetic biology and add value to the initial investment in the DNA synthesis centres.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Synthetic biology has made significant strides over the past decade however, to fully realize the potential of this technology we need to be able to introduce much larger constructs to enable, for example, engineering of complete metabolic pathways or exquisite cell-control mechanisms. However, currently this requires screening a very large number of constructs to identify those that deliver the desired output. One capability missing from the arsenal of the Edinburgh and Liverpool facilities is access to automated medium throughput platforms that can swiftly screen for the desired phenotypes. This assay development capability would enable us to offer more integrated end-to-end service, help reduce the cost of delivering the desired DNA construct, and accelerate the application of synthetic biology across multiple markets. 
EGF and LGM are currently automating DNA synthesis and assembly pipelines using, where possible, technology platforms that can be automated and interconnected. As the design is completely modular it can easily be expanded to include phenotype screening assays. We aim to enable the rapid design and synthesis of multiple varied DNA circuits (e.g. metabolic pathways, biosensors, counting/memory devices) and interrogate the utility of these circuits within host cell cassis via an array of assays including growth and fermentation characteristics, cell health, fluorescent reporters, RNA seq and metabolite profiling. The data generated using this battery of tests will then be processed and used to identify the best highly optimized circuits and inform design principles for the future. This vision will be achieved by adding the following screening capabilities to our already funded DNA synthesis facilities and the facilities already available at our host institutions 1. Medium throughput small volume monitored parallel cultures. 2. Metabolite screening 3. Enhanced DNA assembly platform 4. Software development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Edinburgh Genome Foundry and Liverpool Gene Mill will provide end-to-end design, construction and phenotypic validation of large gene constructs for academic and industrial applications. The novel tool development proposed will enable the the UK to maintain a position of leadership in Synthetic Biology. This in turn will help to attract and retain high quality researchers in the UK.
We have a broad range of good working relationships with local (e.g. Ingenza, Genabler) and international businesses (e.g. Life Technologies, Selex ES, Unilever, GSK) with an interest in synthetic biology and its application and will build on these collaborations. Importantly, our existing and developing relationships with industry partners will ensure we work alongside, rather than compete with, commercial providers while safeguarding our potential to develop Intellectual Property addressing new markets. Currently there are no companies providing DNA design and synthesis with high throughput phenotypic screening in the UK so we are not competing with industry in this arena rather we are working with industry and innovating in an area which will be of great commercial interest in the future. 
Close working with Edinburgh's Research &amp;amp; Innovations and Liverpool's Business Gateway, the Universitys' commercialization support, we allow periodic review of the commercial potential of the technology developed in the EGF and LGM. 
Societal and stakeholder engagement is considered vital to the continued emergence of SB technologies as product. We wholeheartedly recognize the importance of open communication of our research to as wide an audience as possible; both through the scientific and non-scientific press, through various media outlets including the internet and through participation at specialist and general science conferences and festivals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2375873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MSP visit to Foundry</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B1C4F62-A132-45BF-ADBF-CD681B670F2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visit from local MSPs Ian Murray and Daniel Johnson</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b92df16c85d9.89355321</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Arabic TV Visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>444E7A66-D7AD-4552-B673-5945CF98CB50</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visit from Anees Al Qudaihi, from BBC Arabic World Service, who was making a future edition of a Science and Technology programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b92eff9ff6a3.54731033</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Foundry official launch event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EDDEACDA-5330-4BAC-BB70-26CEEDA30FB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To celebrate the EGF opening, the University hosted a second SynBioBeta Activate! event in Scotland in partnership with Scottish Enterprise.

We envision that acoustic dispensing will become an instrumental technology in synthetic biology, in particular in the era of DNA foundries. We have published a paper in JALA describing DNA assembly using nl volumes using the Labcyte Echo machine that was JALA paper of the year. Another paper on CAD for DNA assembly is pending and a paper describing the process of DNA design through assembly and testing is in preparation. The EGF has worked in tight collaboration with Autodesk to develop Genetic Constructor (GC), an open-source web-based Computer Assisted Design tool for Synthetic Biology. The key features of GC were determined after review of existing software and customer research by the Foundry. GC makes it easy to compose new constructs and combinatorial libraries using reusable genetic parts from web registries. It allows he use of &amp;quot;templates&amp;quot; to guide in genetic constructs, and supports for large projects up to genome size. GC also allows to order a designed construct to the EGF directly from the platform, and will hopefully be a source of customers for the different Foundries. The EGF has worked on the implementation of many specialized pieces of software to assist with the robotic operations and decision-making steps of a DNA assembly process. A cloning simulator checks that the DNA parts will assemble correctly and unambiguously and predicts the final sequence. Another application selects the most adapted restriction enzymes for digestion-validation of the clones, and predicts the digestion patterns. Yet another aligns the results of sequencing with the expected sequences, generating meaningful reports to help troubleshooting. To assist with robotic operations, the EGF developed Plateo, a library featuring many parsers and protocol file generators for the different machines of the foundry, which also allows to simulate liquid handling operations so as to foresee problems such as containers being filled over capacity. All these software packages will be released in 2017 under open source licences. As a proof of concept, the EGF has assembled 96 different constructs (ranging from 7 to 25 parts) on the same plate. The process, which took around a week (including validation steps) was entirely assisted by software for the generation of picklist, data analysis, and decision making. The EGF successfully passed the admission test of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium by implementing a simple pipeline in which a sequence gets screened against a database of pathogenic proteins, as well as the NCBI database, in order to detect potentially harmful genetic constructs.
Medium throughput small volume monitored parallel cultures. The RoboLector has been fully installed and many experiments have now been run using it. It has become one of the main workhorses in the lab; experiments are run several times per week and results have been very consistent. The ability to run 48 cultures in parallel, all with separate conditions and/or sampling and induction times has been a great benefit. 
The metabolomics facility has acquired a state-of-the-art Agilent 6560 Ion Mobility Quadrupole Time of Flight (IM-QTOF) mass spectrometer which is compatible with Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC), Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) and Gas Chromatography (GC). We have also acquired a GERSTEL MultiPurpose Sampler (MPS) coupled to an Agilent 7200B Gas Chromatography Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (GC-QTOF).

The former is currently being used in LCMS mode. Methods already developed include the detection and relative quantitation of targeted saponins in yeast and targeted analysis of paclitaxel and structural derivatives from various modifications in bacteria. Untargeted approaches have been tested using Ostreococcus tauri as a model and can be applied to other organisms.

The GCMS is now setup to run Folch extraction and transmethylation derivatisation of fatty acids from cell pellets. Two more derivatisation protocols have been developed to target a selection of oleanolic acid derived triterpenes, simple sugars, polyols and amino acids. Extraction protocols are an on-going concern and will be optimised as projects arise. We can also detect terpenes released by bacteria into the media and trapped in a dodecane layer.

Current projects either in preliminary stages, or to be developed over the next 6-12 months include the analysis of glycans from plants, CHO cells and bacterial biofilms (LCMS), the analysis of isoprenoids in bacteria (LCMS), central carbon metabolism including glycolytic and Kreb's cycle metabolites, sugars and amino acids (LCMS and GCMS).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The EGF is a facility that will be used by a wide range of academics and colleagues from industry for DNA assembly, transformation and testing of genetic constructs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>59BA74D6-589F-48D2-AEFC-29D6E00A6583</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56db3c44f1a996.65100107</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>948E9020-4E60-4BCB-BC2C-932931B9B050</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genetic Constructor: An Online DNA Design Platform.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS synthetic biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3c5a2944ab188682ae512a552e97b5cd"><gtr:id>3c5a2944ab188682ae512a552e97b5cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bates M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2161-5063</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcd3c5db448.89563521</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AA2B8B90-4DCC-435F-9BA6-EB4D6822DE54</gtr:id><gtr:title>Leaf LIMS: A Flexible Laboratory Information Management System with a Synthetic Biology Focus.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS synthetic biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/27adc1e1af12a316fbf539fbcf392fee"><gtr:id>27adc1e1af12a316fbf539fbcf392fee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Craig T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2161-5063</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcda03df836.29321646</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M025659/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA149D63-C62A-40AE-97C3-406048CBC42A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioreactors</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FEBB49F4-3228-4CBC-98AB-99A078FB98B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Functional genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19C5179C-0522-47E8-82DA-48583B56264E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
