There is currently a lack of robust tools and data about the carbon impact of our lifestyles and more widely available generic knowledge is often hard to apply to the specifics of our own lives.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our intention is to develop a mobile app that tracks user choice to build a `rich profile' of the impact of their lives in terms of carbon externality which can also be deployed for identifying and informing users of `critical moments that have impact' -acting as both a 'technology probe' to engage users in a dialogue to raise awareness and offer resources for understanding their carbon profile; and as a form of 'nudge' to facilitate informed choice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will generate cutting edge insight into the complex relationship between individuals' lifestyles and practices and their resulting GHG emissions, while making the very valuable carbon calculation information available to the sustainability community and the wider public. The primary beneficiaries of this research are the environmental and social science communities, the mobile human-computer interaction (HCI) community, and the sustainability community. This benefit will be empirical, conceptual and methodological:
1. The environmental and social science communities will benefit from (i) the availability of cultural probes for both overall carbon footprint information, and for shopping-based food and drink information, and (ii) an increased understanding of practice and consumption in both of these domains and how this impacts on current debates concerning consumption, lifestyle and everyday life and their interaction with other more global issues.
2. The mobile HCI domain will benefit from a better understanding of how to effectively design nudging technology that interacts with and educates users about the sensitive and potentially overwhelming issue of carbon externalities as well as an exploration and understanding of some of the ethical issues involved in such approach. 
3. The sustainability community will benefit from the availability of our open, online centralised carbon emissions database and programming interface by being able to create their own applications with minimal effort, with updates to the data and models occurring transparently.
 
We intend and hope that the participants in our research will also be beneficiaries rather than simple participants through gaining some insights into aspects of their everyday behaviour and the possibilities (and problems) of change.

The ultimate beneficiary of this research will be the UK and its public. The dangers of climate change are becoming widely acknowledged and stringent policies are starting to be put in place to mitigate them. As part of the Climate Change Act 2008, the UK has set targets to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. Despite this awareness, public behaviour remains almost unchanged-the questions of how to engage the public in the carbon agenda remains an unsolved challenge of our times. The motivated public will benefit from applications that will help them to monitor their general carbon emissions and those related to food and drink. We anticipate that the UK will benefit from the insights we collect into how to effectively engage the wider public.

Finally, the beneficiaries include supermarkets, and Booths in particular (though we anticipate that other supermarkets may well become involved). Defra's survey of public attitudes and behaviour towards the environment clearly shows that whilst a significant proportion of UK consumers are keen to know more about the carbon implications of different shopping choices, there is also a risk of confusing or alienating some customers by presenting such information. This presents supermarkets with a real difficulty; how to make information available without forcing it upon people. Our food and drink carbon emissions application will allow supermarkets to increase awareness of climate change issues associated with their products without compromising their customer base.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39414</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have been used in a number of continuing publications on food and shopping.
