We explore three dimensions of the monetary policy framework that have been less well studied in the recent literature on the stabilization role of monetary policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How is the monetary stabilization problem influenced by the public?s perception of the Central Bank as a weak institution?&lt;br />&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How is the effectiveness of monetary policy affected by its interaction with fiscal policy?&lt;br />&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do wage setting practices influence the effectiveness of monetary policy?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Our proposal addresses each question in turn. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the first strand we address the issue of credible institutions, which is particularly relevant for developing countries that aim at adopting an inflation targeting regime. In the second strand, we abstract from credibility issues and analyze how concerns about fiscal stabilization affect the performance and the optimality of inflation targeting. The third strand revisits the foundation of the monetary transmission mechanism by studying the evidence of wage setting practices. This will be critical to understand how inflation targeting operates in practice and interacts with fiscal policy.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>204454</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>There is some evidence on the acknowledgment of our findings based on citations of the output produced in this research and also on the interests expressed by conference organizers in international institutions in inviting papers belonging to this research project.

We examined this along three dimensions. 
In the first strand we address the issue of credible institutions, which is particularly relevant for developing countries that aim at adopting an inflation targeting regime. In the second strand, we abstract from credibility issues and analyze how concerns about fiscal stabilization affect the performance and the optimality of inflation targeting. The third strand revisits the foundation of the monetary transmission mechanism by studying the evidence of wage setting practices. This will be critical to understand how inflation targeting operates in practice and interacts with fiscal policy. 
We find that when inflation target is not fully credible to the private sector, the learning process of both private agents and
the central bank generates high persistence and volatility of inflation even though the underlying shocks to the economy are purely transitory. We also find that the persistence and volatility become smaller as the inflation target becomes
more credible. In studying the role of fiscal policy in an open economy context, we find that differently, from the closed economy framework in an open economy it is not optimal to perfectly smooth taxes and fiscal policy should be conducted in a countercyclical way (i.e. following a positive technological shock, income taxes should increase). In studying the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, we show that the effectiveness of monetary policy is strictly linked to the timing in which policy actions are undertaken: indeed large effects on output and employment are observed when wages are relatively rigid, and none or insignificant effects are when wages are relatively more flexible. So that monetary policy is more effective when wages have just been agreed or set rather than before the wage-setting process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>International institutions and central banks should be interested in the outcome in this research.
