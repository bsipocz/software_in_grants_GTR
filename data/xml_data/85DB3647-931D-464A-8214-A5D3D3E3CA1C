The public perception of the Mesolithic</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Training Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I023473/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Context of the research\n\nRecent research at the Early Mesolithic site of Star Carr has provided some important new discoveries including the excavation of 'Britain's earliest house' dating to about 9500 BC. The 'house' structure would have been very close to the shore of an ancient lake, and on the edges of this lake there is evidence of a large wooden platform made of timbers which have been split and hewn: the earliest evidence of carpentry in Europe. This research led Universities and Science Minister, David Willetts, to say: 'This exciting discovery marries world-class research with the lives of our ancestors. It brings out the similarities and differences between modern life and the ancient past in a fascinating way, and will change our perceptions forever. I congratulate the research team and look forward to their future discoveries.'\n\nThese discoveries are internationally significant and the site is well known to archaeologists around the world, however, local people are largely unaware of it. Surveys carried out in Scarborough over the last 2 years have revealed that on average less than 7% of the local people questioned had heard of the site; less than 5% this year following extensive media coverage in local, national and international newspapers, television and radio! \n\nIt has become an important part of the Star Carr project to disseminate the results of the work as well as broader information about the Mesolithic to a wider public audience, in the region, but also beyond.\n\nThe project will link this research with the expertise of York Archaeological Trust (YAT) who have extensive experience in engaging the public and whose core aim as a charity is to investigate the past for the benefit of present communities and future generations and to disseminate results in a number of innovative and dynamic ways.\n\nAims and objectives\n\nThe aim of the project is to identify and implement best practice for improving public understanding of the Mesolithic period using Star Carr as a case study, with the following objectives:\n\n1. To critically evaluate the ways in which the Mesolithic is presented to the public\n2. To identify and implement effective ways of disseminating Mesolithic research to the public\n3. To measure the impact of activities on public value\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nThe project will be of benefit to the academic community as a case study into how to provide public value from academic research. \n\nThe project should also provide a range of public benefit through dissemination of research activities at Star Carr in a variety of ways. It is considered important to engage school children and to find ways in which the Mesolithic can be used in the curriculum. Another aspect of the project is to consider how modern technology and social networking such as facebook, twitter, apps, podcasts/vodcasts, can be used as ways to engage audiences as well as more traditional methods such as talks, workshops, leaflets and walks. The public dissemination of Mesolithic research should provide financial benefits for regional economies as well as cultural and social benefits more widely.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>For the second phase of the project, the student, together with both supervisors, will devise and test a number of approaches to engage a public audience. These may include engagement with school children, interaction with visitors on-site (perhaps setting up a temporary exhibition and activities over the duration of excavation), involvement of local specialist groups, and multi-media approaches (podcasts/vodcasts, website etc) but these will depend on the direction of the research.\n\nThe public:\nThe main aim of the project is to engage the public in Mesolithic research, using Star Carr as a case study. A wide range of people will benefit from the second phase of the project which involves trialling and assessing different approaches. This will include local historical and archaeological societies, young archaeologists, museum visitors, website visitors, visitors to YAT temporary exhibitions, TV and radio audiences, school children.\n\nWe anticipate that the educational material, events such as workshops and talks and attractions on-site and in the region will attract visitors and should therefore lead to financial benefits for regional economies as well as the cultural and social benefits.\n\nCharities and public bodies:\nIn addition, the project aims to build on previously existing partnerships with public bodies and charities: English Heritage has been supporting the Star Carr project and has been interested in the work Milner has been doing to increase public interest in the local area. The project will feed back the results of the public engagement to English Heritage who will be able to use it in future projects. Milner is also in discussion with English Heritage about writing a new framework document for the Mesolithic and this research would feed into that.\n\nThe Star Carr project is working with Flixton and Cayton Wetlands project (FCWP) (partners: Natural England, The Environment Agency, The RSPB, North Yorkshire County Council and Scarborough Borough Council) with whom we have organized walks in the landscape, and occasionally Milner has given talks to local farmers and landowners in FCWP meetings. It is anticipated that further initiatives will continue and discussions are ongoing concerning ways in which we can integrate information on the natural environment with Mesolithic research in order to create more ways of engaging with a broader range of people with diverse interests (for instance site boards, walks, possibly a visitor centre).\n\nScarborough Museums Trust currently do not have any items from Star Carr on display but they do house the archive and last summer Milner and team ran a Star Carr day workshop for them in collaboration with Scarborough Archaeological and Historical Society. Ideally further initiatives will result in artefacts from Star Carr being put on display as well as engagement with local schoolchildren through the museum.\n\nEnsuring benefit:\n\nYAT has been at the forefront of archaeological knowledge transfer within British archaeology, and has directly benefited the local economy in York via the Jorvik Centre, Barley Hall, Dig and community archaeology projects. The training that the student will receive, together with the expertise from YAT will ensure that the activities are carefully planned, executed, and monitored to assess impact.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023473/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
