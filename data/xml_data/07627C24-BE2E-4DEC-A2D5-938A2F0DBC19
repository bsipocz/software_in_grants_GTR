Generally, communication is mediated by direct cell to cell contact or the secretion of molecules between cells. More recently, it has been shown that cells also secrete vesicles that can mediate various effects in neighbouring cells. These extracellular vesicles are like a 'snap shot' of the original cell from which they are secreted and contain a subset of lipids, proteins, RNAs and DNA specific to that cell. Extracellular vesicles are found in serum, indicating that they are very stable and secreted by many cell types. Additionally, extracellular vesicles are thought to be involved in several disease states including cancer, infection, neurodegeneration and metabolic disorders.
There are two main ways that extracellular vesicles mediate communication between cells. The first involves extracellular vesicles binding to receptors on the surface of neighbouring cells to cause activation of signalling pathways within that cell. The second, involves delivery of the contents of the extracellular vesicle into the cytosol (inside) of the neighbouring cell. In order for this to happen the membrane of the extracellular vesicle must fuse with the target cell membrane to release its contents.
Exactly how this fusion process occurs is not clear and represents a major gap in our understanding of extracellular vesicle biology. Recently I have shown that there is at least one cytosolic protein on the surface of extracellular vesicles that should (in theory) only be located inside the extracellular vesicles. This raises questions surrounding how these extracellular vesicles are made and what the composition of proteins on the surface of extracellular vesicles is. Building on this observation, I intend to identify other proteins with an unpredicted localisation on the surface of extracellular vesicles. This is important because it will help identify potential candidates involved in the membrane fusion process, which is currently very poorly understood. Identification of proteins involved in the fusion process will allow us to understand intercellular communication better and investigate its role in disease. Additionally, I propose to investigate the fusion process at a scale never observed before with state-of-the-art imaging techniques that will allow images to be captured in extremely high resolution. This will directly demonstrate whether membrane fusion occurs and provide vital information about this process. Finally, there is potential for these extracellular vesicles to be used as therapeutics, this study will help direct the design of extracellular vesicles for the delivery of drugs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication by transporting messages between cells. This is achieved via two mechanisms, firstly by activating receptors on the acceptor cell, leading to intracellular signalling. Secondly by delivering their contents, such as proteins, RNAs and DNA, into the cytosol of acceptor cells. The latter is specific to EVs and requires fusion with the target cell membrane to transfer their contents into the cytosol. However, this important process is currently poorly understood.
EVs include vesicles formed from budding at the plasma membrane and those originating in the endocytic pathway. Regardless of origin, the current model for EV biogenesis dictates that the location of proteins in vesicles should reflect their original subcellular location. That is, cytosolic proteins are in the lumen and cell surface proteins are on the surface of EVs. Recently, I showed that the cytosolic protein, Annexin A2, localises to both the lumen and the surface of EVs. This raises questions surrounding the protein composition on the surface of EVs.
Building on this observation, I propose to investigate the protein composition on the surface of EVs. This will provide important information about EV packaging and allow identification of candidate proteins involved in membrane fusion. Using a proteomic approach, EV surface proteins will be identified. Candidates with known membrane binding/regulatory functions will be assessed for a role in membrane fusion using biochemistry and imaging techniques. Furthermore, the membrane fusion process and the role of these proteins will be directly investigated using super-resolution microscopy.
In summary, this project will contribute significantly to understanding EV biology and function. It will provide important information about protein packaging, and translate this into functional analysis with EV fusion on target cell membranes. This data will be valuable for the use of EVs as therapeutics.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The field of extracellular vesicle biology has exploded in recent times (with fewer than 100 PubMed articles prior to 2010, and greater than 1100 in the six years since). They have been implicated in many biological processes in both healthy and disease states. Despite their importance, many fundamental questions remain regarding extracellular vesicle formation, cargo incorporation and their fusion with cells. This project will have major impacts on the field by addressing the last two of these questions.
This research will contribute significantly to the academic community specifically those in the areas of extracellular vesicle biology and the protein trafficking. In a more broad sense it will positively impact the fields of cancer cell biology, immunology and neurodegenerative disease; all of which extracellular vesicles play an important role. This work will provide invaluable timeless insights into the role of extracellular vesicles in protein trafficking, and will provide vital details on the fusion process that is essential for cargo delivery (such as RNA and proteins) into cells. This work will be promoted in the scientific community, not only by publication, but also through the attendance of conferences and networking events national and internationally.
Other players that will be impacted by this work include pharmaceutical companies developing extracellular vesicles for therapeutic use. Any information gained regarding packaging proteins onto extracellular vesicles and their subsequent fusion with target cells must be considered during vesicles for drug delivery. Furthermore, these findings may be exploited to improve the efficacy of drug delivery through membrane fusion. As such this research also has the potential to benefit the wider community, as this technology may be applicable to many disease states.
Finally, this research will be available to the general public as any publications will be open access through the university. There will be many opportunities to communicate this exciting research to the general public within Cambridge and many public engagement programmes are run through the university, such as the Soapbox public engagement event. In addition to this, BBSRC media training will be attended to ensure clear succinct communication of the research to the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304783</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F8906F7A-E309-4FCB-850D-7CE0C19D730A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unconventional secretion of annexins and galectins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Seminars in cell &amp; developmental biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/47670c8e5e5d01e96a313d77cc7281db"><gtr:id>47670c8e5e5d01e96a313d77cc7281db</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Popa SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1084-9521</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d58e7822ed9.96398006</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P010911/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73EF98E1-3FA8-46A0-BE46-00AE16C7D999</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Communication &amp; signalling</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DA052B9-38AC-4F23-88FA-66C8DEB08B81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organelles &amp; components</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
