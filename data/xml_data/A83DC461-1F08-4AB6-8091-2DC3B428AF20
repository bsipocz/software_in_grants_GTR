Iron is essential for phytoplankton growth as it is required for a number of important enzymes that participate in both photosynthesis and respiration. In contrast with terrestrial systems, iron is present at very low concentrations (less than 1 iron atom to every billion water molecules) in the open ocean. Thus phytoplankton photosynthesis is limited by iron over large parts of the ocean. This iron deficiency has important ramifications for the earth system since phytoplankton photosynthesis is an important means by which the ocean regulates global climate. 
Mid-ocean ridges are an important source of iron with estimates suggesting that ridge-derived iron makes up 25-75% of global ocean iron stocks. These mid-ocean ridges are the deep-sea mountain ranges that form a single global mid-ocean ridge system throughout the world's ocean, making it the longest mountain range in the world. At these ridges, new magma mixes with seawater and is exhaled as a high temperature fluid. While this ridge fluid has been noted to be a large source of iron to the deep-sea, the far field influence of this iron depends on its retention in dissolved forms by ocean chemistry. Our recent work shows that iron from mid-ocean ridges appears to have a much longer lifetime than previously thought and be exported up to 4000km away from the ridge. 
Despite the emerging role for ridge-derived iron, we do not understand its impact on deep ocean iron stocks, as well as how iron is mixed into surface waters to drive biological activity. We have highlighted that understanding the fate of ridge-derived iron and its ultimate influence on the ocean requires more information on the quantity and chemical form of iron supplied by ridges (e.g. dissolved or particles) and how these change with distance from source. To do this we need to appraise the role of small organic molecules called ligands and so-called iron nanoparticles, which have been invoked to control the lifetime of ridge-derived iron. Accounting for the specificity of iron within hydrothermal systems is key to constraining its wider impact. In addition, recent work by our colleagues has shown that interactions between the deep ocean tide and the ridge itself can elevate rates of physical mixing. If increased vertical mixing typifies mid-ocean ridges it implies that these regions may also exhibit efficient transfer of iron to surface waters. Given the ubiquity of mid-ocean ridges, the synergistic combination of these phenomena may be key to the large-scale supply of iron to surface waters.
Sampling and measurement of iron at very low concentrations in seawater is challenging and the applicants are among the few research groups in the world who are able to do this reliably. Our group is at the forefront of representing the role of iron is global ocean models, which are crucial tools for assessing larger scale impacts on biological productivity. This project will participate in a NERC funded research cruise where scientists with expertise in measuring mixing and other macronutrients will be studying the nutrient and carbon pump over mid-ocean ridges. This proposal will therefore benefit from these measurements and will add value to this cruise by determining the associated role for iron.
Overall, this project will provide state of the art observational and modelling constraints on two important aspects of the ocean iron cycle: 1) How does the ocean ridge impact physical mixing of iron to the surface and 2) what chemical processes control the large scale influence of the iron directly supplied by mid-ocean ridges. Ultimately we will be able to address the broader question of how the amount and chemical form of iron from mid-ocean ridges can influence phytoplankton growth in the open ocean.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who: Immediate beneficiaries of 'The impact of mid-ocean ridges on the Ocean's iron cycle' will be (i) researchers interested in processes governing the cycle of iron in the ocean, how this links to the large scale cycling of carbon and ocean biogeochemistry; (ii) climate modellers who need to parameterise the iron cycle and, in particular, account for how changes in climate modify vertical fluxes of iron to surface waters; (iii) policy makers and civic leaders who will benefit from a greater understanding on the factors governing the potential removal of carbon from the atmosphere and its long-term storage; (iv) public outreach school children, high school and college students, teachers and the general public interested in understanding big questions in science. 

One of the greatest challenges facing oceanographers is communicating oceanography to non-scientists, school children, careers advisers and policy makers. Explaining the importance of iron in the ocean where it comes from and how iron limits microscopic phytoplankton to non-specialists is challenging but vitally important if we are to recruit students into oceanography, convince the public that it is worthwhile funding and increase awareness of the sensitivity of the ocean to climate change. 

How: 
Engaging with Policy makers and civic leaders: Tagliabue will engage with policy makers, civic leaders and the wider community through the Research Centre for Marine Sciences (www.liv.ac.uk/climate) at Liverpool. Lohan will work with access public engagement specialists Public Policy@Southampton at the University of Southampton; a team of senior researchers with expertise in building links with key decision makers from the private, public and third sector. Public Policy@Southampton will support the team to plan activities to engage with policy makers through a dedicated consultancy service. 
Our new model of hydrothermal iron supply and cycling will have impact the sensitivity of regional productivity and air-sea CO2 exchanges to variations in climate and will therefore be of interest to groups in the UK (e.g. the Met Office) and internationally with the development of earth system models for the next IPCC report.
Public Outreach: Our main focus is to engage with school children, high school and college students and the general public. Our aim is to emphasise the importance of the role the ocean plays in limiting the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and how iron is integral to this process. We will create a series of four short accessible videos.
1. 'Iron in the Ocean' will focus on illuminating how the ocean iron cycle functions and how it interacts with biological activity.
2. 'Measuring the iron' will be a short documentary style film focused on the methods used to measure iron at sea. 
3. 'An Iron Journey' will demonstrate the transport of hydrothermal iron on the mid Atlantic ridge until it eventually is mixed into surface waters in the Southern Ocean. 
4. 'Iron and Carbon' will illustrate how biological production can regulate atmospheric CO2 levels and how modifying rates of production by changing iron supply impacts CO2.
These video outputs will be distributed via YouTube and through relevant Southampton and Liverpool websites and open days. Both GEOTRACES (http://www.geotraces.org) and SCOR (http://www.scor-int.org) have expressed enthusiasm for embedding our video outputs in their websites. SCOR will provide $1000 and will ensure it reaches a world-wide audience. 
These video outputs will be shown to invited policy makers and civic leaders via future events organized by both institutions. 
Summary of Resources: We request 3 months support for Dr Heath (UoL) to implement the Pathways to Impact, and develop the animations and films proposed. Funds for Co-I Heath to travel to one of the project meetings in Southampton to obtain material for the videos are requested. Funds are also requested for the public policy unit at University of Southampton.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236522</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B8D153A6-0390-4B11-BA34-B201D4285364</gtr:id><gtr:title>The integral role of iron in ocean biogeochemistry.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7a4b753969cb84b0158552e3e54127ca"><gtr:id>7a4b753969cb84b0158552e3e54127ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tagliabue A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a350b03b5dd51.14341425</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N009525/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C29F371D-A988-48F8-BFF5-1657DAB1176F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean - Atmosphere Interact.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
