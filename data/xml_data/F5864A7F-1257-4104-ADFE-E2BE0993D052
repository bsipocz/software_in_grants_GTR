The probabilistic approach is appropriate since specific trajectories are unpredictable in &amp;quot;chaotic&amp;quot; systems.

Research in ergodic theory has tended to focus on situations where the underlying measure is a probability measure. However, over the last twenty years or so, the study of infinite measure systems -- infinite ergodic theory -- has emerged as a significant area of research with connections to several areas of mathematics (from number theory to mathematical physics) and numerous noteworthy applications. 

The proposal is to hold a week-long workshop on infinite ergodic theory at the University of Surrey during May 2012. This will build on recent unexpected breakthroughs in infinite ergodic theory by researchers at the University of Surrey, coupled with the presence of Professor Jon Aaronson who is the undisputed world-leader in the area and who is the recipient of a Leverhulme Visiting Professorship to spend 6 months at Surrey during 2011-2012.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Infinite ergodic theory has links with many branches of mathematics such as harmonic analysis, number theory and probability theory, as well as implications for mathematical physics. The latter is illustrated by a 3 week conference held at the Max-Planck-Institut fur Physik fur komplexer Systeme in Dresden during Summer 2011. This conference entitled &amp;quot;Weak Chaos, Infinite Ergodic Theory, and Anomalous Dynamics&amp;quot; was co-organised by mathematicians (including the VF Zweimuller) and physicists. The interest of physicists derives from the breakdown of the ergodic theorem for infinite measure systems. In particular, Lyapunov exponents do not converge pointwise and a basic theorem of Aaronson states that there is no normalisation that yields pointwise convergence. However the Aaronson-Darling-Kac Theorem gives the precise distributional sense in which appropriately normalised exponents do converge. There are many papers in the physics literature on the phenomenon.

Potential beneficiaries are mentioned in the previous item of this form. The above paragraph elaborates on the impact on physics. The effectiveness of the Dresden workshop and the proposed Surrey workshop in ensuring that various groups of potential beneficiaries have the opportunity to benefit are discussed in Pathways to Impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14554</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The week-long workshop was held and seemed to be very well-received and successful.

The tangible outcomes (numerous publications and seminars) of the PI and other participants are the result of years of work, so it is hard to draw direct links to this week. But it is is reasonable to believe that the workshop played a useful rule in helping to catalyse these activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Since it was a week-long workshop, it is hard to quantify direct connections of future work with the workshop.
