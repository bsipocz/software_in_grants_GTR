Companies</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L013614/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>'Gut feeling' is often understood to be an implicit part of creative designing yet its process has not been observed and is little understood. Designers think of themselves as intuitive, and they are expected by employers to behave in intuitive ways when designing consumer goods. In contrast, engineering designers are not expected to exhibit these characteristics and would typically work in apparently more rule-based ways. The history of observing designing has often been largely reductionist and rationally based. 

This proposal aims to make gut feeling and its value explicit by eliciting the views and experiences of practicing designers and those closely linked to design within small firms. This will include the recording the recollections of selected intuitive tracks or themes within early stage designing of consumer goods. After an initial scoping workshop in the University, a number of network events will held be over 6 months in each company and will involve analysis of the recorded discourses used by designers in their exchanges. This will establish the places of gut feeling in practical design decisions and produce original research material. Designers' gut feeling in 'hindsight stories' will be recorded. Within each company this will attempt to capture critical details of the start, evolution journey, lifespan and geography of selected critical intuitive decisions. This will involve extremely sensitive participation by the research student and generate a considerable amount of text-based narrative, which will be ethically developed and evaluated. 

Software (Nvivo 9) will be used to manage these narratives and the development of models of the concepts and ideas emerging from the analysis, while providing an audit trail of the analysis process. The research will be underpinned by previous work in both Knowledge Transfer and Risk in Design by the supervisors originally funded by AHRC: RG/AN6609/APN17512, 1/2/04-30/4/07 and will form a sound basis for participation with small companies and in dissemination. Participation will provide an effective and novel means of identifying decision-making in authentic situations, over extended periods within new product development projects. 

By capturing intuitive themes from designer's original decisions it is planned that the explicit nature and value of intuition will be characterised in detailed case study material for each company. The wider implications of gut feeling or intuitive thinking, including creativity in design, as a central component of designed products will contribute to a clearer understanding of innovation in designing products. It is hoped to provide a defence of creativity within increasingly pressured and restricted design environments. 

This research is important because it will provide new knowledge about designing, the design process and participatory research methods. It will also increase the capability of participating companies and their designers to utilise intuition, through in-company seminars at the completion of the work. Dissemination will be for academic communities through journal publication but also for participating companies and will include international network development aimed at further research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research is important because it will: 

1) Provide new knowledge about designing, the design process and participatory research methods
2) Develop the field of design thinking for practitioners and researchers
3) Increase the capability of the participating companies and their designers 

A contribution to a global understanding of the place and meaning of 'gut feeling' in design is planned where such terms are used regularly with little common understanding. An indicative explanation has been expressed around the fundamental notions of human identity, unity, essence and dependence (Guarino and Welty, 2000). A sharing of knowledge of practice-based principles of intuition in design will stimulate a new and wider cultural discussion about the nature of design and the aspirations of designers. Such potential sharing, particularly within the early design phases are described by Kitamura et al (2004) as being scattered across technical domains. Whilst sharing may suggest the unification of ideas and the development of generic styles of thinking it is envisaged that recognising individual designer's interpretation around intuition can positively impact on the quality of design thinking and risk.

It is planned to bring forth new practical knowledge about design in an environment where risk assessment is increasingly encouraged but paradoxically intuition is relied on. This will influence the role of designers as team members where they will increase the transparency of what they might do without such transparency affecting its novel value. The direct relevance of the work is potentially seen in both designers' ongoing work and in the collaborating companies increased understanding of intuition. As intuition is an important component of creativity, so this project proposes a defence of creativity in design. The Centre for Enterprise will ensure that the participating companies have increased unusual knowledge about the development of design and the aspirations of their designers. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has been active in helping to develop Creative Industries, most recently through a variety of 'creative economy' projects throughout the UK, along with the Higher Education Academy (HEA) and the National Endowment for Science, Technology and Arts (NESTA, The Work Foundation, 2007). The design sector is an important part of the economy with an annual turnover of &amp;pound;11.6 billion and employs 185,000 people in the UK (DCMS, 2010, 2013).

This was used by several team members, and not just designers. Some interpretations of gut feeling, as part of strategic decision-making which fall outside of straightforward cause-and-effect logic, appears to be systemic in the majority of companies researched. A use of the term 'gut feeling', within the company, appears to reflect good knowledge capacities and confidence

Gut feeling was a frequently used on-going aspect NPD, particularly for fast, early-stage initial solutions, and openly acknowledged by most as not merely semantic. Its management depended on the nature and sector focus of the company. Some welcomed it, others resisted it depending on the interpretation of professional rule based constraints and guidance and compensated appropriately. The use of the term 'gut feeling' in NPD can be used to merely bolster confidence.

The acknowledged value, or otherwise, of gut feeling, impacted NPD where substantiated risk-taking and risk sharing was present but such value was unacknowledged when such strategies conflicted with rules and conventions of professional product design. When experienced designers made decisions, based on deep product knowledge, adroit readings of the market and a good sense of balance between form and function etc., gut feeling was acknowledged to be a strategic risk. 

The use of 'gut feeling' as a strategy in NPD is an aspect of the human condition and cultural environment in risk-based decisions. Product designers recognised that consumers and clients also act on gut feelings and utilised aspects this knowledge, thereby sharing certain risks. 'Gut feeling', as an unconscious part of aesthetic based or non-aesthetic based decisions; around one NPD it may be used by several people within the company in paralle

Gut feelings represent an aspect of risk-based serial innovation and cannot be easily separated from the combined practices of design and entrepreneurship in small company NPD.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The initial findings were delivered to the 37th Institute for Small Business Conference Manchester 5-6th November 2014 (1).
