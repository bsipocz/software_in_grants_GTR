Such problems are encountered in a very large range of applications, including classic problems in operations research and artificial intelligence, many forms of scheduling and planning problems, and problems in cryptography, computer vision, chemical synthesis and gene matching. 

The Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problem (or Max-CSP) is a generalisation of the CSP whose range of application is even greater: it includes many combinatorial optimisation problems that are not easily expressed in the basic CSP framework. In this problem the aim is to find an assignment of values to the variables of the problem which maximises the number of satisfied constraints.

Both the CSP and the Max-CSP are NP-hard, which means that it is unlikely that there exist efficient general algorithms that can solve all instances of such problems. Thus one can try to design heuristics which perform well on certain kinds of instances, or else one can restrict the general problem in order to obtain a more tractable problem (for example, a problem which can be solved in polynomial time). Most of our research is concerned with the second approach: we try to identify the restrictions on constraint satisfaction problems which are sufficient to ensure they can be solved efficiently.

In this project we aim to find a novel approach to defining such restrictions that is more powerful than anything that has been considered before, and allows us to identify many more kinds of tractable problems. In the past, the only kinds of tractable problems that have been considered fall into two distinct classes. In the first, the constraints are arbitrary, but they can only be applied to the variables in limited ways. In the second, the constraints fall into a restricted family of constraint types, but they can be applied to the variables in an arbitrary way. Both of these kinds of restrictions have led to interesting mathematical theories, and some important special cases which can be solved efficiently. However, we believe that it is now possible to combine these approaches and obtain a much more general theory that unifies the previous approaches, and provides a more flexible way to define the restrictions on problems.

By developing this more powerful approach we hope to be able to describe much more accurately which kinds of constraint problems can be solved efficiently, and to use this information to improve the available software tools and analytical techniques.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In an advanced industrial society decisions have to be made constantly about the allocation of resources to achieve complex goals efficiently. These range from the planning of complex construction projects, to the allocation of energy resources, and from the deployment of personnel in large organisations to the configuration of consumer products or electronic devices. In many cases, especially in large organisations or scientific investigations, special-purpose software is being developed and deployed to try to make the appropriate decisions optimally. A new generation of software tools is emerging, based on new techniques for the solution of combinatorial optimisation problems: SAT-solvers, and general constraint solvers.

However, very little is known about when such tools can be used effectively, and when they will fail due to combinatorial explosion - where the number of potential solutions grows too rapidly to be effectively explored, even by the most efficient software tools.

Computational complexity theory can shed some light on this issue by distinguishing those problems that are inherently difficult from those which will yield to an appropriate carefully-chosen efficient algorithm. Constraint satisfaction problems provide a very clean generic framework where such theory can be developed. Considerable progress has already been made, but the results obtained so far are often too specific and too sensitive to the details of the problem formulation to be widely applicable. In this grant we will explore whether a new analytical tool, based on local patterns in problem instances, can be used to provide a much more widely applicable theory. This approach should result in many more cases that can be shown to be efficiently solvable, and hence the development of more effective tools. Many of todays information technology companies are investing heavily in constraint research and looking for new ways of understanding and tackling constraint problems. This research offers one such new approach.

As well as its practical applicability, research in this area has the potential to shed light on some fundamental issues about the nature of computation. One of the great unsolved mathematical problems listed by the Clay Institute as &amp;quot;Millenium Problems&amp;quot; is the problem of distinguishing computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and hence establishing the limits of efficient algorithms (this is the heart of the so-called &amp;quot;P versus NP&amp;quot; problem). By developing a general theory to distinguish tractable and intractable constraint satisfaction problems we hope to develop new tools for approaching this fundamental problem.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder
