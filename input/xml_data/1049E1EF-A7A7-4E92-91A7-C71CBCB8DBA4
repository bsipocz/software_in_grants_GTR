This work has increased awareness of critical trends and signalled the potential dangers of systemic risk to an industry with a critical economic and social role. We have extended the understanding of financial markets by further developing its social perspective. Looking beyond economic assumptions of risk traders as rational individuals inhabiting markets, we explored the social interpretations that construct markets. Hence, we have generated new insights into the way people, their activities and tools, interact in the construction and collective interpretation of markets. 

Based on our research findings, we have produced an integrated suite of strategy tools and frameworks to support strategic positioning, relationship management and risk analysis and trading in the global reinsurance industry. We have facilitated the implementation of these tools and frameworks through tailored reports to firms worldwide, commissioned company-specific strategy workshops, targeted distribution of our industry reports, invited presentations at prestigious industry events, articles in the media, a free access website that includes research findings material, and training activities for reinsurance professionals.

The scope and importance of the research impact was been highly recognized through the award of the inaugural ESRC's Outstanding Impact on Business Prize in 2013. The impact has been supported through high-profile engagement at both the (a) organizational level by producing customized reports for participating organizations and delivering strategy or training workshops, and (b) industry-level by producing industry focused reports, covering key issues in several media outlets and presenting key findings at numerous high-profile industry events.

The impact of incorporating our research findings and implementing our models has been felt within companies, as demonstrated in feedback we received from many of them. Companies used our research findings to explain their management approaches and objectives and incorporated frameworks and models that we have developed to improve their organization processes. 

There has also been endorsement of our research findings by high-profile industry bodies and leading players as an impetus for industry change. The premier professional organisation in the insurance industry, the Chartered Insurance Institute, endorsed our reports, frameworks and calls for change to the degree of awarding accreditation credits for insurance and reinsurance professionals attending our research-related lectures and making the associated material available to their global membership. They thus incentivized the use of our materials in industry training and development. Further, a group of leading insurers, reinsurers and brokers from key markets supported a series of training and development workshops based on our strategy tools, specifically targeted at developing the strategic thinking of senior professionals, and attended by a selected group of future industry leaders.</gtr:description><gtr:id>566C5FB0-04B9-45C8-856D-4D762621AE4B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545c1349c2bb80.30886358</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The study had the following objectives and key outcomes in relation to each objective: 

1) To investigate the proposition that the Lloyd's and Bermuda marketplaces differ in terms of a predominance of expert, face-based judgment in the London market and electronic, modeling-based judgment in the Bermuda market. 

Key Outcome: While some differences do persist between the two markets, the most striking finding is convergence in the use of modelling, but difference in the workflow process (see pages 4-8 of the executive report) 

2) To provide a people-centered analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach for the various stages of the transaction process 

Key Outcome: Despite remaining differences between the two markets, there is no one best way. Rather, there are weaknesses in both approaches, with redundancies in the Lloyd's process and lack of richness in the Bermudian process. Hence, it is more important to understand different phases of the UW process in order to selectively and mindfully employ face and electronic interaction as is fit for a specific transaction (see pages 8-10 and 17-18 of the executive report)

3) To consider the implications and challenges of each business approach for industry evolution

Key Outcome: The generic findings show that a market built around a central physical location, such as Lloyd's, is valuable for business that requires face-to-face contact at the point of decision-making. However, much business can be transacted through selective use of face at prior stages in the process, rather than at the 'point-of-sale'. Bermuda is an example of such a 'transportable' reinsurance market; markets can be established where regulatory and taxation conditions are favorable rather than necessarily being bound to a particular physical location. 

The specific findings show how the selective use of face-to-face and electronic interaction can reduce inefficiencies and improve decision quality in either type of market (see 32-page executive report, which provides detailed results and recommendations).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The study has had considerable non-academic impact, as the results comprised the basis for 5 insurance industry and wider financial services sector presentations in London, Continetnal Europe and Bermuda. It was also the subject of 11 media articles, 9 in the insurance reinsurance specialized press and 2 in the mainstream business media. 

We have also given feedback in the individual companies that worked with us at a range of levels from the CEO and senior executive level, through to the underwriting and broking teams with which we worked. I have used this opportunity to also induct my team into industry feedback presentations.
Finally, we released a report on our findings 'Trading risks: The value of relationships, models and face-to-face interaction in the global reinsurance market. (with M. Smets &amp;amp; P. Spee).

This report was presented widely and also made available on the Lloyd's website, the Aston website and is now available on the Cass
