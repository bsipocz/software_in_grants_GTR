In 1986, after the pioneering work of Bednorz and Mueller, it was soon discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have critical temperatures, Tc, above 90 Kelvin (183 degrees C). These high-Tc superconductors renewed interest in the topic because of the prospects for improvement and potential room-temperature superconductivity.HTSCs have attracted great interest not only for their obvious potential applications in electronics, high-power magnets and high-precision detectors, but also for their scientific complexity. Despite 25 years of intensive development, the origin of HTSC and various thermodynamic phases arising in these materials are still not clear. Of fundamental importance is that all these systems are characterised by strong electron correlations, where conventional methods used in Condensed Matter Physics are not functional. As it has become clear recently, the unusual properties of these materials are governed by the presence of a quantum critical point at zero temperature (S.Sachdev 2008, D.M.Broun 2008).The purpose of the proposed research is to apply novel theoretical methods to be able to describe such strongly-correlated electron systems: HTSCs as well as two-dimensional electron gas and heavy-fermion compounds. This research is interdisciplinary: it requires knowledge of both condensed matter theory methods, quantum field theory and string theory.These novel methods are commonly called holography'' (J.Maldacena 1997, A.Polyakov 1998, E.Witten 1998): these are motivated by string theory and are applicable to the region of the phase diagram near the quantum critical point. Holographic methods are capable of describing the unusual properties of materials in terms of gravity theory in higher-dimensional space-time, where symmetries of the quantum critical point are realised geometrically. Holographic methods can be extended to non-zero temperatures by considering gravity solutions with black holes; and many real-time dynamical properties of the material, such as conductivity and heat transport may be computed. Thus, there exists a fascinating and previously unexpected opportunity to connect superconductors with black hole physics. The holographic framework has recently become very popular among string theorists, but the connection of these models with underlying lattice physics has not yet been established on the microscopic level. Studying this connection and establishing explicit relations between known microscopic lattice models and holographic models is the central objective of the research. This is expected to lead to a brand new framework for describing high-temperature superconductors and other materials with exotic properties. It may even lead to the prediction of new phases of matter.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The development of room-temperature superconducting compounds would significantly and widely impact the quality of life and cause a technical revolution. Obvious obstacles in using superconducting devices in everyday life (the need for expensive cryogenic devices) would be removed: there would be levitating trains, compact ion accelerators (which may be used for electric rocket engines), super-fast and energy-efficient electronics based on superconducting circuits and Josephson junctions, and indeed, decreased power consumption might even solve the climate change problem. These techniques would in the near future influence security (terahertz scanners based on Josephson junctions), health (tomography), information technology and exploration of the cosmos. The new generation concepts in computing, transport and electronics would, without doubt, impact on social welfare and national security, influencing governments and policy makers, for example, those investing in capital transport projects across the globe.Unfortunately, to date there is no good theory for high-temperature superconductors that would give answers to all the questions posed. The proposed research applies novel mathematical developments, coming from string theory (a very complicated model with aspirations to be the theory of everything) to the understanding of physical phenomena in superconductors on microscopic level. There are several known materials with exotic properties to which the new concepts can be applied. Thus the proposed research is a first step to be made from mathematics to application. One of the aims is to disseminate the novel ideas coming from string theory among the condensed matter specialists. This new way of thinking about physics would almost certainly lead to new approaches to the development of novel materials. The final stages of proposed research include contact with experimentalists capable of creating such novel materials. Cost-effective methods for industrial manufacturing of superconducting materials could be developed. It is hard to estimate the realistic timescale for room-temperature superconductors, but other useful applications might follow in as little as 5 years. Any aspects from my research that may be directly commercialised will be developed through Loughborough University Enterprises Ltd who will provide help and advice on the exploitation process for any directly applicable IPR.I aim to present my results at cross cutting conferences in applied physics (reaching a broader audience), which may, in turn, lead to contact with non-academic parties, such as industry and government advisors, working groups and other public-facing bodies. I hope that my attendance at high-profile conferences would lead to positions on working in groups with influence on legislation and strategy. I aim to broaden the influence of my work in this way at every opportunity.On the broadest scale, the new theoretical concept of using black holes for describing superconductors might be of interest to the general public. I aim to convey the developments proposed to wider audience, including non-scientists and school children. The Department of Physics at Loughborough has a successful outreach programme that I would be keen to assist.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>153811</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Loughborough University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Dr. Joseph Betours</gtr:description><gtr:id>53D9361B-F598-4C74-A88D-C55FA7B8255B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications on the topic of Fermi surface topological transitions and theory of Sodium Cobaltates</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544800d893c303.31080234-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Experience, guidance, problem formulation</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Joint works on graphene and Fermi-surface reconstruction</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Wisconsin-Madison</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof. Andrey V.

University: Graphene physics and Fermi-surface reconstruction phenomena.
 
I have shown that magnetization of graphene near the Dirac point is a non-linear function of the applied magnetic field and this 
behaviour must be observed even at room temperatures and even with not-so-clean samples. This is an important 
message to experimentalists who typically fit their data by linear curves. 
In another work I compute the contribution of quantum capacitance of graphene to Casimir (a.k.a. van der Waals) force measurements 
involving graphene in magnetic field. It was found that magnetic field will change the electric charge induced on graphene. 
This lead to an additional electrostatic force that is comparable to Casimir force. 

My recent research in the area of graphene is related to epitaxial graphene grown on the surface of SiC. This was shown to be essentially a bilayer system of graphene and localized holes in the immediate vicinity. I have shown that in magnetic field (relevant to Quantum Hall Physics) the holes may be attracted to form molecules with sizes proportional to the magnetic lengths. This may be relevant for the physics of the new resistance standard made of SiC graphene.

The second part of my activity was motivated by interesting experimental results for compound called sodium cobaltate (Na_x Co O_2).
This is a whole range of compounds since one may continuously vary the sodium doping x. 
This is an almost two-dimensional layered compound known to have anomalously large thermopower making it potentially useful for new 
efficient power generators. There is no generally established theory that would describe the material, in particular, the origin of high 
thermopower is not clear. This material have some resemblance to High-Tc superconductors and the theoretical methods developed and 
tested for High-Tc can be applied to cobaltates. We did calculations to support the conjecture that an additional Fermi-surface appears 
at a critical composition x=0.62. We have presented a new and rather general result that magnetic fluctuations make this 
appearance of the Fermi-surface a first order quantum phase transition (called the Lifshitz transition or the Fermi-surface topological 
transition) and studied thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the system. We have shown that strong (near-critical) magnetic 
fluctuations are responsible for the non-Fermi-liquid behaviour observed near composition with x=0.7 and explained the experimental 
results for specific heat. The further goal in this direction is to apply the developed theoretical framework to the description of 
anomalously high thermopower which will allow to propose the ways to further increase the effect and facilitate the commercial energy 
applications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My results for graphene is directly relevant for researchers who do experiments with graphene in magnetic field. In particular, these results are important for understanding of the physics involved in graphene Quantum Hall Resistance standard. 
The results for cobaltates present a possible explanation of non-Fermi-Liquid behaviour and pave the way to explain the high thermoelectric effect which might make thermoelectric energy generation practical and help reduce the Carbon footprint.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FEAC98FA-FDA2-458D-B381-2D7BF71480A9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447f5f523d741.96795072</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C711F09C-A497-458D-B9A4-237938AA88E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effect of paramagnetic fluctuations on a Fermi-surface topological transition in two dimensions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/170fa14435aa466e3e0c983e02b8c435"><gtr:id>170fa14435aa466e3e0c983e02b8c435</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Slizovskiy S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5447dfdeca57f6.57083231</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71F3E46E-7C7E-4353-899B-2C78BD836AF3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nonlinear magnetization of graphene</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/170fa14435aa466e3e0c983e02b8c435"><gtr:id>170fa14435aa466e3e0c983e02b8c435</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Slizovskiy S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0500504e5266e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>85817EBC-5B66-4CDE-A4F0-A5BDA65B1247</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bound states of charges on top of graphene in a magnetic field</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/170fa14435aa466e3e0c983e02b8c435"><gtr:id>170fa14435aa466e3e0c983e02b8c435</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Slizovskiy S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ba5322c9d3b9.45663152</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>595D6BCE-E3CE-4C62-AA78-C533B1835D41</gtr:id><gtr:title>Charging of graphene by a magnetic field and the mechanical effect of magnetic oscillations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of physics.
