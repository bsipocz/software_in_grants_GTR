scholars connected with the Centre for Buddhist Studies in Bristol have shown an interest in death related topics in the various Buddhist traditions (Tibetan, Sri Lankan and Chinese). This research has raised particular questions which the project will address in two independent but complementary studies: a postdoctoral research project on Buddhist death rituals in Southeast Asia and a doctoral research project on Chinese Buddhist death rituals. The three main areas of research within the study will be:\n\n1. Common Core of Theravada Buddhist Rituals\nDo the Theravada countries of S and SE Asia have more in common than the use of a sacred language (Pali) and reliance on Pali canonical texts? Is there a shared set of death rituals?\n\n2. Relationship of Monks and Laymen\nWhat is the nature of the interaction between monks and laity in the context of death? What is the impact of issues, such as financial costs and the fact that monks act as mediators between the living and the dead on this relationship.\n\n3. Interdependence of Text and Ritual\nThe texts commonly recited in the context of death rituals are composed in Pali, an ancient language which is not generally understood by those participating in the rituals. Does that mean that the content is lost on the listeners? What function do the recitations have? What is the relationship between ritual practice and Theravada doctrine?\n\nWhile a certain amount of research has been completed, particularly by French scholars such as Bizot, Gabaude, etc. most of this is either dated or deals with death rituals only in passing. Moreover, these studies are either characterised by a particular approach (ethnographic, textual, etc.) or focus on a particular country (either Sri Lanka or Thailand, etc.). Our project will take a much broader view, bringing together a range of perspectives from different academic disciplines and from different Buddhist countries.\nOur research methods, too, are multidisciplinary and combine field work methods (participant observation, interviews, etc.) with textual study. The latter will be employed in defining and interpreting the nature and use of Pali texts in SE Asia and Sri Lanka.\nThe project management combines scholars of different background and expertise: Prof. Paul Williams, Director of the CBS and Prime Investigator and project leader, is an established Buddhist scholar with a broad knowledge of various Buddhist traditions and editing experience. He will oversee the study and bring together the different strands of research. Dr. John Kieschnick (Co-Investigator) has published on the impact of Buddhism on Chinese culture. He will assist the PI and supervise the PhD student. Dr. Rita Langer, a trained Indologist with philological expertise and field work experience, has published in the area of Buddhist death rituals. She will be the Research Assistant for the area of Southeast Asian Buddhist rituals. Finally, a PhD student working on Chinese Buddhist death rites would complement the study of Southeast Asian ritual.\nThe plans for dissemination of the project findings are varied. Firstly, the material will be presented at two academic conferences and published as a collection of articles in the form of an edited book. And secondly, an exhibition will reach out to a wider audience and the chosen media (images and video films) will make the material easily accessible.\nIn conclusion it should be added that the project is conceived of as a collaborative venture for the CBS. Colleagues, research fellows and PhD students are working together to contribute from their various fields of expertise to an in-depth and multi-faceted understanding of the dynamics of Buddhist death rites. The network of international connections which the CBS has over the past years built up will maximize efficiency while limiting the costs in the field. We are confident that the project will be a success and represent value for money.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>300412</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Bristol, 23 Oct - 11 November 2009; Leeds, 1 - 23 February 2010; now an online exhibition: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/thrs/buddhist-centre/projects/bdr/exhibition/</gtr:description><gtr:id>5CEBAE64-318F-4B78-9878-1AE2717E9F4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This exhibition formed the basis of a follow up project &amp;quot;Understanding Buddhist Death&amp;quot; which made findings available and accessible to schools, chaplains and the general public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-4721591206.93951a70f771c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>'Ancestors and Hungry Ghosts'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bris.ac.uk/religion/buddhist-centre/projects/bdr/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:id>83150130-58FF-4B08-972D-817A03A7543E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>m-4848827510.000046a70ce63c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Spirit's Happy Days: Buddhist Rituals for the Dead in Southeast China</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:id>00A589F4-0BC0-4CF7-8365-F31256E4B705</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>m-5727293273.180065a711aa64</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Death and Dying in Buddhism: Glimpses into various Buddhist cultures</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'Caring for the beyond: Two Lao Buddhist festivals for the deceased' is a film by Patrice Ladwig and Gregory Kourilsky. 35 mins, Lao with English subtitles and voice-over.

Ancestors and deceased relatives form an important part of religious life for Buddhists in Laos. The film focuses on two festivals Boun Khau Padap Din and Boun Khau Salak. During Boun Khau Padap Din food and offerings are provided by members of the lay community in order to feed spirits, ancestors and ghosts. During Boun Khau Salak food and offerings are placed into a basket. Lots are then drawn to see which monk will receive the food and transfer the merit to the deceased</gtr:description><gtr:id>0381530C-4864-42AF-BF96-EC19DD1AD99A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The films have attracted interest and have been shown at various venues including the universities of Bristol, Leeds and Hamburg; the Max Planck Institute (Halle); Ecole fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient (Paris); and the Conference of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (Atlanta, USA).

The images are available as online exhibition on the website (see above) and have already been utilized at least once (Buddhaday Vesakh celebrations in the Birmingham Museum in May 2010).

The film screenings in Bristol and in Hamburg were attended by many members of the public as well as academics from those institutions. It has therefore already been demonstrated that these research outcomes have an appeal and value for people outside academia. In addition, we were approached by a Thai Buddhist temple group in the Midlands who wanted to show material from the project at an event they were holding at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Although outside the project dates, this offered an opportunity to show one of the documentary films and a digital version of the photography exhibition and suggests a potential market for future uses of the research material.
The project website also presents material for the general public as well as for other academics and teachers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FA7BBA35-D163-47BF-AD20-06CEF7DDF6C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460e31f0ea680.04383990</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project's chief importance lies in its documentation of funeral rituals and practices not previously recorded or analysed.

The Bristol Buddhist Death Ritual Project was awarded funding by the AHRC. It was an interdisciplinary collaboration between anthropologists and experts in Religious Studies. The project was concerned with Laos and Thailand in Southeast Asia, and China, and was the first comparative academic study of Buddhist death rituals in these two very distinct cultural areas. Some of the chosen locations and rituals, such as the festivals for the dead in Laos and China, have not been documented before. The Understanding Buddhist Death Project has created resources about death and dying for chaplains and healthcare workers that are in contact with Buddhist patients. These can be used by chaplains of any faith and do not need a prior understanding of Buddhist thought.The Understanding Buddhist Death Project has also created resources for teachers and students. These materials cover many aspects of the A Level and GCSE curriculum, not just death rituals.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E86AA9C4-3FD7-4413-8182-42908AB1A45A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Buddhists and non-Buddhists across the world, educators, students and chaplains are among those who have benefited personally, academically and professionally from the imaginative dissemination of Bristol's pioneering research into Buddhist Death Rituals in Southeast Asia and China.

These multiple approaches to the sharing of new knowledge have led to beneficial impacts on a wide variety of individuals, from schoolchildren on the brink of adulthood to people receiving comfort on their deathbed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546114f1983f57.54628654</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The Understanding Buddhist Death Project</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/religion/buddhist-centre/projects/bdr/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7DC75381-3034-4708-8D43-E44C763369E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Buddhist Funeral Cultures of Southeast Asia and China</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9769760558236d73dabc28823e41b822"><gtr:id>9769760558236d73dabc28823e41b822</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>P.
