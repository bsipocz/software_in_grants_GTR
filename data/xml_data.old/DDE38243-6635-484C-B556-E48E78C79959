However, current UAVs are greatly limited by being able to operate in air only, preventing them to move effectively on the ground or in water. Hybrid air-water mobility would address the societal need for remote water sampling in inaccessible areas such as during floods or after nuclear accidents. For example, UAVs could quickly provide water samples following a nuclear accident to better coordinate response efforts. While some UAVs can land on water, no technologies are available that allow them to both dive and fly, due to dramatic design trade-offs that have to be solved for movement in both air and water, and due to the absence of high-power propulsion systems that would allow a transition from underwater to air.

Expanding on my emerging leader position in aerial robotics, I will develop a novel generation of hybrid flying robots, called Aquatic Micro Aerial Vehicles (AquaMAVs). These robots offer the revolutionary mission capability to fly to a site of interest, dive into the water to take a water sample and provide video footage and retake flight to return to the base station.The engineering approach will build on the analysis of aerial-aquatic animals such as flying fish, diving birds and gliding squid, and the implementation of their key bio-inspired design principles using the best of robotic engineering.

This First Grant Scheme application, leveraged by major strategic investment from Imperial College to the AquaMAV research area and a recent donation of &amp;pound;1.25m for a new flight arena, will allow me to establish scientific leadership in bio-inspired aerial robotics. It will build the basis to deliver the key building blocks for aerial-aquatic robots requiring innovation in propulsion, adaptive morphologies and autonoy that allow for hybrid mobility. The final goal of this first grant is to demonstrate novel propulsion systems and wing folding mechanisms that are tailored to AquaMAV requirements. Following this grant the systems will be integrated in a fully featured AquaMAV that can fly, dive into water, dive while taking water samples and transition back to propeller driven flight. Besides the application oriented impact, this project will also deliver key scientific insights on locomotion modalities for robotics across varied terrain.

Having partnered with five industrial partners, including the National Nuclear Labs and Shell, will provide the pathways to industrial impact and continued research support building on the results from this grant. Major corporate interest in this project is demonstrated by committed resources of more than &amp;pound;65k of in kind benefits from industrial partners and two CASE studentships for higher Technology Readiness Levels of AquaMAV. This grant will provide the bridge in research staff resources that will allow the demonstration of AquaMAV principles and build the basis for future impact. Aerial-aquatic robot mobility is widely unexplored and this project will initiate a novel and high impact area in academia as demonstrated by support from leaders in robotics and biology, including support from Harvard University. Once realised, AquaMAVs will be a major technological stepping stone for new robotic applications, such as search and rescue in flooded buildings, for water sampling during oil spills or after nuclear accidents, and for low cost oceanographic data collection, all of which are areas of vital national importance to the U.K.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact beneficiaries include industry, marine research centres and the wider public. In this section I will describe who will benefit and how. The pathways to this impact are described in the Pathways to Impact document.

Industrial impact:
I have partnered with five companies that have recognised the impact potential of AquaMAV and are offering more than &amp;pound;65k in in-kind support and two CASE studentships to pull the achievements from this grant to higher technology readiness levels (see support letters). Each of these companies has a distinct role by providing technological expertise or by representing a field of AquaMAV applications. The industrial partners can be broadly classed in two categories; as (i) end-user partners who are interested in using market ready AquaMAVs and (ii) as translation partners who are interested in adopting the AquaMAV technology and developing it to market ready products. The specific expertise of the partners are partially overlapping which is intentional and one pillar of risk mitigation in the development of AquaMAV towards industrial impact.

My primary end user partner and the closest collaborator will be Shell who is interested in applying AquaMAV for emergency response, for oceanographic sampling and for de-risking oil exploration. The pioneering mission capability of AquaMAV will bring a major differentiating technology to the oil industry, in particular to vulnerable areas such as the Arctic Sea where floating ice dramatically limits manual sampling capabilities. AquaMAV will allow for cheap and low-risk monitoring of the ecosystem providing not only cost savings and competitive advantage to Shell but also allowing to protect the environment by reacting quickly to emergencies.

Other areas of AquaMAV applications are represented by the following institutions with whom I will interact regularly to involve a variety of end users in AquaMAV development.
-The National Nuclear Centre for decommissioning and first response after nucear accidents. -The Centre for Environment, Fisheries &amp;amp; Aquaculture Science for monitoring marine infrastructures (Cefas).
-Operation Wallacea for monitoring of corral reefs and other marine ecosystems.

My primary translation partner will be National Instruments (NI) who offers expertise in electronics, control and sensing and who is already an established provider of industrial technology frameworks. The collaboration will consist of using NI electronics on the robots and LabView for the 3D motion tracking environment. The established expertise of NI in these areas and NI's commitment of providing technical assistance and training as a match to this grant will be of great benefit to the project. At the same time, AquaMAV will be an informative application platform for NI robotics solutions that will help to leverage AquaMAV application towards NI's established network of industrial clients.

Societal impact:
Further beneficiaries of impact will include the wider public who will be involved in the research through museum exhibitions, public talks and Hackaton events at Imperial College. Using my established network and track record of public media interaction I will communicate academic findings to society and continue to consult on government policies for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle technologies and opportunities.

The researchers and students working on the AquaMAV project will also be beneficiaries and carriers of impact through their training in interdisciplinary robotics research. Several of my students are already spinning off the technology to promising ventures and will influence society with both, their technological expertise and their transferrable skills that they developed during the work on the AquaMAV project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98541</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A proposal for an exhibit based on aerial-aquatic locomotion has been accepted for display at the 'PhD as Art' competition sponsored by the Royal College of Art.

Examples include flying fish, flying squid, diving birds and diving insects. We have reviewed the biological literature on these multimodal animals and abstracted their underlying design principles with the aim of building a robotic equivalent, the Aquatic Micro Air Vehicle (AquaMAV). Our exploration has identified key adaptations from nature and designs from robotics. Based on this evaluation we have proposed key design principles for the design of successful aerial-aquatic robots, i.e. using a plunge diving strategy for water entry, folding wings for diving efficiency, water jet propulsion for water takeoff and hydrophobic surfaces for water shedding and dry flight. Current Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are greatly limited by being able to operate in air only. Designing multimodal MAVs that can fly effectively, dive into the water and retake flight would enable applications of distributed water quality monitoring, search and rescue operations and underwater exploration. While some aircraft can land on water, no technologies are available that allow them to both dive and fly, due to the dramatic design trade-offs that have to be solved for movement in both air and water, and due to the absence of high-power propulsion systems that would allow a transition from water to air.
AquaMAV is a unique robot that can fold its wings to dive into water from the air. Once submerged it records data and collects water samples. A high-pressure water jet then thrusts it back into the air to continue flying.
Being capable of locomotion in both air and water, AquaMAV would enable novel mission profiles in complex environments, such as water sampling after floods or underwater structural inspections.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Compared to manual sampling, AquaMAV can provide much faster and cheaper assessment of the aquatic environment without putting humans at risk. This is of particular importance in vulnerable and inaccessible environments, in case of emergency situation or for periodically monitoring the environment.
The impact of the outcomes of the project is demonstrated by the CDE funded project and the interest of TV/radio/press and environmental agencies.
The researchers are currently looking to collaborate with oceanographers and various water authorities to take their testing to the next stage. The aim is to deploy the robot in a wide variety of scenarios, to test the robot's limits in waves, wind and weather, and examine the physics of high speed dives into water. An additional propulsion system is also under development to make the AquaMAV fully aquatic, capable of long periods of submarine operation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A9B0B8B2-2B88-4998-A4A2-D20B7E8C44FE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9bf1e8ecfc5.27318712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/aerial-robotics/research/aquamav/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation of project by Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5F9ED06D-6AD1-47D4-BC1F-5B9FE53B9697</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c99064a05637.21018357</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PN-479#fullreport</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>AquaMAV prototypes were tested in wind and water tunnels that are part of the national wind tunnel facility.</gtr:description><gtr:id>ED7F4A58-823E-46C3-9962-05F198CFE76A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The required setup included the design of an automated catapult launcher for the water tank and an automated data collection unit for the wind tunnel.

For example in smaller flying robots we take inspiration from house flies to create perching mechanisms based on mechanical intelligence of the body morphology. For larger robotic systems we rely on integration of complex control, sensing, and planning to enhance perching robustness. Inspired by ballooning spider, we have developed perching systems that enable stable motion of drones in 3D space based on strings and magnets. In order to develop efficient printing methods, we are inspired by nest creation methods employed by animals such as Swiftlet in nature. We have developed light weight deposition mechanisms and integrated them into flying drones that can turn Polyurethane foam materials into complex 3D structures that are more flexible in size and location.</gtr:description><gtr:id>230863F2-0218-4BE8-B699-B6C6438B3224</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impact so far. However, the work by Aerial Additive Building Manufacturing has been praised by a large number recognized academics and industrialists in the field, who are keen to collaborate with us on the existing or related future grants. This gives a very positive prospective for the societal and technological impacts of Aerial ABM within the near future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c958ecac7562.14638889</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Bioinspired technologies for construction and repair of the built environment</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/895</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17C00A6A-5A42-422C-AE84-CE3312BEC09B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Power and Control Autonomy for High-Speed Locomotion With an Insect-Scale Legged Robot</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/656d25faeed494535cd328751b86b2d0"><gtr:id>656d25faeed494535cd328751b86b2d0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goldberg B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8d94c12f6703.53206687</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>931B08D2-6F6A-4131-AE7D-2D62A9B2D734</gtr:id><gtr:title>Anchoring like octopus: biologically inspired soft artificial sucker.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7820a4eb2c9671f8c3761f802b4a6995"><gtr:id>7820a4eb2c9671f8c3761f802b4a6995</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sareh S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-5662</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8d9763ee0c11.25279143</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8C7C046A-CEB2-4F83-A7E8-EC6EF5009216</gtr:id><gtr:title>A biologically inspired, flapping-wing, hybrid aerial-aquatic microrobot</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science Robotics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aabb4a3c08d22654d635504cdccd286f"><gtr:id>aabb4a3c08d22654d635504cdccd286f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chen Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8d96dc860881.17822383</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0DC51605-945C-4B9F-ABA8-5E2C656F3C95</gtr:id><gtr:title>Efficient Aerial-Aquatic Locomotion With a Single Propulsion System</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/838fb3b433832b2cd9e881a96c21779c"><gtr:id>838fb3b433832b2cd9e881a96c21779c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tan Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c9385cd84701.50635635</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9735A099-ECE2-455F-B8CD-5D6B6369A105</gtr:id><gtr:title>Efficient Aerial-Aquatic Locomotion With a Single Propulsion System</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/838fb3b433832b2cd9e881a96c21779c"><gtr:id>838fb3b433832b2cd9e881a96c21779c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tan Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8d97a8ac2708.89571317</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17DE5579-575D-47C6-AF56-86E1EC08719B</gtr:id><gtr:title>ROBOTICS.
