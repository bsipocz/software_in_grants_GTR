Conceptually at its broadest level it combines 'feeling good' with 'effective functioning'. This has prompted attention to a variety of facets, from macro level (e.g. OECD's focus on economic indicators of well-being such as GDP and the current UK Government's creation of a 'national well-being index') to concerns over individual physical, mental, spiritual and emotional well-being. This seminar series will focus on a key aspect of well-being, that of well-being in the workplace, often termed employee well-being. 

A plethora of research evidence indicates that poor well-being at work can lead to adverse physical and mental health consequences for individuals and negative organisational outcomes such as increased sickness absence and reduced productivity of workers. In particular, stress and mental health issues are now cited as the primary cause of long-term absence from work. As such, this seminar series will focus predominantly on psychological well-being, aiming to add insight and understanding into the ways employee mental health and well-being can be managed and sustained.

The increase in interest in employee well-being sits within the context of changes to working lives and experiences. Globalisation, work intensification and increased job insecurity are all indicative of 21st century work. Furthermore, we are changing how we work (i.e. the increased use of mobile technologies and less face to face interaction), where we work (an increase in home or mobile working and an increase in the geographical mobility of workers), when we work (e.g. flexible working regulations and work life balance issues) and who works. For example, there are now more female workers, more international workers and more older workers in the UK. In addition, the economic downturn has also contributed to the challenges in managing well-being at work, as employers, HR managers and occupational health professionals are being expected to deliver more, in less time but with fewer resources. 

Given the significance of the topic, a seminar series which highlights the importance of sustaining employee well-being is justified and timely. The series aims to provide greater understanding of the nature of well-being, how well-being can be measured and how it can be fostered. In doing so, awareness will be raised of ways in which employee well-being can be managed in a holistic and sustainable way. The series will draw upon international, sector and life stage differences to consider ways in which the needs of employees can be balanced with organisational performance. It will also bring together non-academic stakeholders from diverse backgrounds with both early career and established academic stakeholders from a range of disciplines, thereby offering opportunities to bridge the gap between academic research and organisational practice, as well as facilitating research capacity building.

Eight of the one-day seminars will each focus on distinct, but inter-related, aspects of sustainability of employee well-being. The themes will encompass: reconsidering the nature of well-being; reviewing current opportunities and challenges in sustaining employee well-being; exploring mechanisms for sustaining well-being in the workplace; learning from international approaches; revisiting ways in which well-being is measured and ways in which workplace interventions are monitored and evaluated; and thinking about challenges associated with well-being extending across a longer working life. The final seminar will take the form of a one day mini conference, the purpose of which will be to utilise more formally the inter-relations between the previous seminar sessions by inviting delegates to reflect on the discussions from the previous seminars and to work together to forge new partnerships to take the employee well-being agenda forward.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In terms of academic impact, the breadth of disciplines involved and the international contributions naturally leads to a broad scope for publications. Endorsed by the CIPD, the Human Resource Management Journal will be targeted for a special issue on sustaining employee well-being in order to maximise readership across practitioners too. Palgrave Macmillan publishers will also be approached with regard to publishing an edited book. In addition, it is anticipated that a number of papers arising from the seminar series will be submitted to journals such as Human Resource Management, International Human Resource Management, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, BMC Public Health, Journal of Health Economics and the European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology. 
The anticipated engagement with multi-disciplinary stakeholders at the seminar sessions also highlights the potential for impact beyond the academic setting, and for creating exciting new research collaborations. In order to promote knowledge exchange, leaflets targeted at HR professionals on best practice for managing employee well-being will be created and distributed via the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development network. 
Given the potentially broad appeal of the well-being agenda, press releases will be targeted to mainstream media outlets (such as daily local or national newspapers) and to more specialised publications, such as People Management and OP (Occupational Psychology) Matters. As the seminar series will run over a three year duration, there is scope for the development of a website to promote the Seminar series which will provide relevant information for all contributors, delegates and other interested parties. This is also a medium by which international contact can be initiated and subsequently where cross-discipline and cross-cultural working relationships can be fostered. The information below gives a summary of potential stakeholders and how they may benefit from participating in the seminar series.

Employees - Greater awareness and understanding of how work affects well-being and the responsibility of organisation and employees themselves for well-being. This can lead to better individual health outcomes.

Employers - benefits include minimising costs in terms of sickness absence, turnover and lost productivity, maximising organisational performance and attracting and retaining top talent. Organisational level interest in employee well-being may also increase morale amongst workers.

Policymakers - Case studies and academic research findings can be drawn upon to direct future policy and highlight priority areas for concern or for future research e.g evaluation and audit of workplace interventions to improve employee well-being. ONS well-being report highlights that government want to measure what matters - increased awareness of evidence on what these issues are will help direct future government research and policy.

HR professionals - increased understanding of employees and learn how to best manage well-being, advise on how to train line managers on dealing with employee well-being issues. Learn most appropriate ways to improve well-being in their organisation and context specific barriers to uptake of interventions. 

Trade Union representatives - To increase awareness of trade of current concerns experienced by employees which could lead to an uptake in Union membership, and could also direct priorities and initiatives that may further the interests of existing and future Trade Union members.
Independent bodies (e.g. CIPD, MIND, ACAS) - Raising awareness of mental health issues at work and the relevant sources of advice and support may encourage individuals at risk to seek advice/treatment earlier leading to better prognosis. This awareness could also help these organisations to identify key issues to lobby round or to develop as initiatives for future campaigns.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16723</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Most importantly, the series has generated a vibrant and diverse network of academics, practitioners and policymakers all bringing different knowledge, experience and insight into employee well-being and to the crucial issue of how we can sustain employee well-being in the fast changing world of work. Now that the series has ended, the strong network is now seeking to continue the conversations surrounding managing and sustaining employee well-being beyond the remit of the series. The social capital generated by the series has been immense and will be a long standing resource for those involved in the series to be drawn on going forwards, for example in terms of seeking advice from relevant stakeholders, making research links, and facilitating access to policymakers.
Another key achievement of the series is the holistic approach and multi-disciplinary nature of the sessions that we managed to achieve through careful selection of speakers. To date this has arguably been a gap in the field of well-being research and practice. Speakers have spanned disciplines, institutions, professional bodies and have come from as far as field as southern Australia and, more close to home, from Paris, Sweden and across the UK. A strength of the series has been the involvement with and inputs from key policy bodies (e.g. OECD, CIPD, HSE and ESRC) and a wide range of practitioners, including representatives of leading employers, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and P&amp;amp;G, NHS Employers, as well as independent well-being consultants. The links made with the various prestigious professional bodies have been a rare opportunity to get access to research resources that may have otherwise been unavailable, for example, links with the OECD and with HSE have proven particularly useful. The high profile speakers secured to present at the various seminars have often opened doors for the securing of further venues and speakers for other seminars, such as The Work Foundation and the Scottish Parliament. This has proved invaluable in raising the profile of the series, but also in broadening out the network beyond academia, which in turn has extended the debates to incorporate a wider range of perspectives. 
A significant achievement is the approved proposal for publishing a special issue of the International Journal of Human Resource Management (ABS 3*), entitled 'Well-being and HRM in the Changing Workplace'. Sixteen submissions were received for this from around the world, some authors were academics who had been involved in the series, others were not. Five papers will be selected for the Issue which is due for publication in June, 2017.
The session on 'Measuring well-being' which was held at The Work Foundation in central London showcased a range of methods by which individual, organisational and national levels of well-being could be measured. The presentation where findings were reported from a piece of research which required participants to gather video diaries over a period of time garnered a great amount of interest. Partly due to the limited amount of qualitative research used to date to gather information on well-being, but also due to the rich data that could be generated using this method and the context it provided to the data which has been relatively untapped in previous research but becoming increasingly relevant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From continued communications with the network as a whole and with small groups within that network, it is clear there is an enthusiasm for and commitment to building on the relationships created through the seminar series and taking the conversations and acting on these to pursue research and funding collaborations. For example, a Linkedin group is being set up for seminar series contributors to join as a means of sustaining the network and continuing the debates emerging from the series. Academics, practitioners and other relevant stakeholders often operate in silos without the benefit of sharing knowledge and experience from others. In establising the LinkedIn group, this will be a rare opportunity for these silos to be broken down and for multi-disciplinary discussions to flourish. Furthermore, due to the success of the series, discussions between the seminar series organisers and ESRC staff to explore how the series could continue, potentially under the umbrella of the What Works Well-being hub, are underway. This is one avenue by which the network could continue as a whole. In addition, a number of smaller groups within the network who have similar interests are currently in talks to take more specific research projects forward. For example, academics from the University of Chester, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Edinburgh Business School and University of York are in discussions around submitting a funding bid to pursue research evaluating the effectiveness of Mental Health First Aid training in higher education institutions.
Although discussions amongst these smaller groups are at early stages now, it is anticipated that at least some of these will lead on to research publications and/or funding bids in the longer term. Holding the final seminar at the Scottish Parliament has been instrumental in creating opportunities for seminar contributors to build research links at a policymaker level too.
The large number of PhD students which were involved in the series, some of whom presented their PhD work have been exposed to a number of high profile academics, practitioners and policymakers through their involvement in the series. The ethos of the seminar series funding is to keep the seminars small so as to facilitate conversation and this has been an absolute strength of the series as individuals from a variety of backgrounds and career stages have been able to come together and discuss ideas which in a larger, or more formal setting would not have been as feasible.
One key aim of the series was to strengthen the links between academia and practice and this was certainly achieved. The benefits of this are far reaching, not only in terms of knowledge exchange and greater understanding of others' experience but also in terms of creating relationships where we can continue to share knowledge and experience and potentially work together, beyond the remit of the series. One example of this is that Seminar series co-organisers were approached by the editor of HRZone, a web based resource for HR practitioners, to contribute to an online academic insight report on the topic of corporate well-being (For more details, see Corporate wellbeing: Academic Insight Report, at https://www.hrzone.com/resources/corporate-wellbeing-academic-insight-report).
The seminar series website is a resource that can be used by anyone and may be of particular use to independent practitioners as a freely available and accessible resource.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7B6A2FA1-2DC4-4132-889F-C3ADB0677268</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>587e084b8d52b9.53300838</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/research/clusters/organisation-studies/seminar-series</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE2FB154-850D-4881-BFA9-2C62637C9E20</gtr:id><gtr:title>Well-being and HRM in the changing workplace</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The International Journal of Human Resource Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c1c8d50c8150ebf3d51d59975eac9cc"><gtr:id>7c1c8d50c8150ebf3d51d59975eac9cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kowalski T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>59e62012bcba49.00440710</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000946/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>D2FDBCBF-3BED-48C4-9C0C-AEC33D60572B</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000946/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>29090.24</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-01-17</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>5F7A15B5-2CB7-4FA0-BEAD-B9A5925BACC4</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000946/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>16723.31</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-18</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-10-17</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>44154EBB-A654-4E26-A79F-AB885BFC3D5F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial-Org/Occupational</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
