&lt;p>The questions that this Fellowship will focus on are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What are the skill levels and skill sets needed in logistics and SCM in UK today and ten years into the future?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What is the skill gap that currently exists, and how can that gap be eliminated?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How should the UK build an agreed strategy between employers and government on jobs to ensure reciprocity and fairness, and who should provide the training in order to eliminate the skills gap?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How does this issue vary with the size of business and across this industrial sector?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To facilitate access to data for this Fellowship, the LI has very good links with companies to draw upon. Many of the companies have mentioned this skills gap and the lack of enough qualified talent on all levels; thus the industry impact from the results of this Fellowship's work will be immediate and substantial.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Hull University Business School research in education and learning has been highly recognised internationally and the Logistics Institute has been established as the centre of excellence in the field of logistics research and education. The proposed Fellow will assist in building this interface between education and learning and logistics skills needs and produce tangible results in this field in terms of most suitable programmes required for the industry. The Fellowship will focus on both managerial and non-managerial positions in logistics and the supply chain. There are many operatives needed to perform basic functions of order picking, vehicle loading, and delivering goods to the customers. However, these jobs are becoming more complex with the addition of information technology (IT), meaning they are no longer really unskilled jobs. 
At a recent conference of the Automated Materials Handling Systems Association, Professor David Menachof led a discussion regarding the desperate need for skilled labour. Further, a discussion panel at the 2012 Multimodal Exhibition featuring Professor David Grant and a number of industry and trade association experts noted that there is a large skills shortage in UK logistics and SCM. Finally, Invest in Doncaster, the commercial promotion division of Doncaster Council, is promoting a new logistics/distribution park in their region. However, in discussions with the LI, they are also concerned that they will need more people with the appropriate skills to work within the sector.

There should be notable impact on decision making, policy building, and tactical planning levels in both the public and private sectors. Decisions on training and skills provision will have a demonstrable impact on the potential growth of the logistics sector at local, regional and national levels in the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002736/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2E2E80C2-8D14-44CE-A971-37A9ACC4B244</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufact.
