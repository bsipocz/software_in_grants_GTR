The study area is southwest England and south Wales. Within this area, four twinned study sites have been selected: the national parks of the Pembrokeshire coast and Exmoor, and their near neighbours, the Gower Peninsula and the Quantock Hills AONBs. Gower was the first designated AONB in England and Wales (1956), closely followed by the Quantocks (1957), England's first AONB. Pembrokeshire was the first coastal national park (1952) specifically established for its coastal values. Exmoor (1954) was included in the initial rounds of national parks designation. Pembrokeshire and Gower constitute the first paired sites and Gower and the Quantocks form the second pair.
 
The central research question is the difference in the formative legislation (Addison Report, 1931; Dower Report, 1945; Hobhouse Report 1947) that determined the selection, designation, and future protection of landscapes as either national park or AONB. National parks, from the outset, had a dual purpose to protect landscapes for their natural beauty and preserve them for the enjoyment and open-air recreation of the British public. AONBs did not receive a statutory mandate to provide recreation and public access. This was initially a protective designation without the clear position regarding recreation and access that national parks were given from the start.

The central paradox in national park designation, between environmental protection and the provision of a recreational amenity, is one of this study's main themes. I will investigate whether this initial legislative difference has led to different usages and expectations. The attempts of national park and AONB authorities to reconcile landscape 'use' with landscape 'delight' (to employ the language of T.C. Smout) lies at the heart of this project. This study charts the identification by individuals and groups of Pembrokeshire, Gower, Exmoor and the Quantocks as places of recreation, and investigate the relationship between recognition of landscape quality and notions of appropriate use. How landscapes are defined and classified in terms of value (scenic, environmental, cultural-historical and recreational) influences the manner in which they are enjoyed. Whilst my proposed study sites have historically been highly valued for their landscape quality - Wordsworth and Coleridge, for example, found inspiration in the open ridges and thickly wooded valleys of the Quantocks, and enshrined in their poetic works particular landscape values that have powerfully shaped the Western sensibility toward nature and the outdoors - some more recent approaches to the purpose and use of these sites challenge traditional notions, and generate conflict. I will focus on the rise of outdoor leisure pursuits, especially so-called 'extreme' or 'adventure' sports, and examine the close and complex relationship between landscape protection, landscape enjoyment and landscape use through a place-based, site-specific approach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My identified research area connects with two key AHRC emerging themes. Addressing 'Care for the Future: Thinking Forward Through the Past', my research takes the vital issue of understanding shifting cultural values, and applies it to places that many know and enjoy, yet often without being aware of their history and protected status, and which few scholars have studied in depth. I will explore the changing cultural values attached to these British landscapes, and how they have been expressed and enshrined via legislation, and reflected through use and land management policies. 
 
My work also addresses the 'Connected Communities' theme by exploring different understandings and uses of particular landscapes within the communities that live, work and play in these sites. As well as examining and working with those who formulate and implement policy, I shall investigate and liaise with user groups representing particular recreational interests, such as the British Mountaineering Council (based in Manchester) and Surfers Against Sewage (St Agnes, Cornwall), who have spearheaded campaigns to improve access to sites within national parks, particularly in Pembrokeshire. The watchdog groups constitute another category of non-official community group included in my research. Improved historical knowledge of past policies and practices and the relationship between local community and national stakeholders has the capacity to inform future policy. From speaking with employees of national parks and AONB authorities, I have established that there is a genuine interest in this research, and the future collaborations to which it could lead (at this stage, formal partnerships are not necessary to facilitate the research). The stewardship of Britain's cultural heritage - the landscape component of which looms so large - is squarely addressed by a keener understanding of how these landscapes have been used, altered and protected over the past half-century. An awareness of the past will help secure long-term protection policies that can preserve landscapes and their associated environmental values far into the future, while responding to the demands of the present. 

Interaction with landscape management professionals will be a central ingredient of my research. Harder to quantify but no less important than publication of two academic articles will be knowledge exchange with those working at and using the selected sites. My study is timely, as the sixtieth anniversaries of Gower (2016) and Quantock (2017) AONBs approach, and discussion of plans for commemorative activities will be a leading aspect of the end-of-fellowship workshop. 

An ECF will enable me to establish research methods and forge links with managers at Quantock and Gower AONBs and Exmoor and Pembrokeshire national parks who will be included as project partners on a planned inter-university project based at Bristol. This project (currently in its early planning stage) will build on the success of the AHRC-funded project, 'Militarized Landscapes in Twentieth Century Britain, France and the USA' (2007-10), continuing research into British landscape protection and use that began with the exploration of military training areas by the project members, and was extended by my attendance at two of the three site-specific workshops that were the focus of the AHRC Research Network 'Local Places, Global Processes: Histories of Environmental Change' Research Network (for which my proposed ECF mentor is Principal Investigator). Just as the Militarized Landscapes project worked effectively with Defence Estates as project partner, this ECF will allow me to cultivate working links with the AONB and national park authorities that I hope to consolidate by including them as partners on the planned consortium project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56222</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Quantock Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Quantock Hills AONB Service</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB49091E-F996-4BE3-A1D9-F920DACB3E66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcome: close working relationship that enabled two future AHRC-funded projects to run successfully: 'Fallen Fruits' (GIS mapping of orchards in the AONB, and cultural history of local apple production) and 'Know Your Bristol: Orchard Roots', in which (among other activities) we developed a public celebration of Quantock Apple Heritage at the Quantock Hills AONB headquarters at Fyne Court.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cac998b47f4.59387150-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>QH AONB Service allowed me to access their archives, and gave interviews.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Contributed to Joint Advisory Committee AGM and spoke about the collaboration and value of partnerships between the AONB and the university, ensuring continued funding for specific events - including the Quantock Apple Heritage day that developed of this partnership (but that was an output of a later AHRC-funded project, 'Fallen Fruits: Mapping Orchard Decline in the Quantock Hills'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exploring Protected Landscapes: Managing and Researching National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty from the Twentieth to the Twenty-First Century</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>684CDD3F-CCD8-473E-B3C9-B6369E761F02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A one-day workshop that brought together land management professionals, local people and academics to explore the history and future of landscape protection in Britain. We discussed the successes and challenges that national park and AONB designation have brought to particular places, and explored what those designations mean for residents and visitors, as well as the landscapes themselves. We also discussed ways in which academic research can inform future policy-making and land management in practical and productive ways. Participants were invited from the national park and AONB organisations that I worked with throughout the fellowship (Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and Quantock Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Service); local recreation and conservation groups (the Exmoor Society; Friends of Quantock); the Defence Infrastructure Organisation; and Bristol and Exeter Universities.

The workshop cemented research relationships I've established with a number of non-acdemic bodies, incl.MoD's DIO, Pembrokeshire Coast NP and Quantock Hills AONB Service. As I continue to explore questions of recreation, access and landscape protection in these (and other) places, maintaining these links has been invaluable.

The workshop brought together professionals from the organisations at the heart of the project's research - Pembrokeshire National Park, and Quantock Hills AONB; other organisations with a vested interest (and often statutory remit) in the management of national park and AONB landscapes in the southwest of Britain - namely, the Ministry of Defence, and Natural England, and Countryside Council for Wales; early career academics; and representative from the Friends of Quantock Hills citizen preservationist group. Discussions focused on how better understanding of the history (and context) of land protection legislation in Britain could be used to improve operational and public-engagement aspects of current land management practices, and to understand current pressures on landscapes. An outcome of the workshop was the development of the working relationship between the Department of Historical Studies at the University of Bristol, and the Quantock Hills AONB Service, which together went to on secure funding from the AHRC and other funding sources to undertake a study of historical orchard use in the area, which in turn has informed planning advice and land management practices in the Quantock Hills, and provided a public resource for local historical research in the form of orchard maps.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf17a9967e47.41370351</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presented research to the Quantock Hills Joint Advisory Committee Annual General Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BDD02C99-A7EC-478F-9639-FFC83046BA52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by Quantock Hills AONB to present my research on AONBs and National Parks, to demonstrate the value to the AONB Service of working with outside experts and the ongoing working relationship that has been established between the AONB and the University of Bristol's Department of Historical Studies. The JAC allocates some funding towards engagement activities for the AONB Service, and my presentation was intended to promote the value of external academic research for the AONB Service (which has very limited resources).

The JAC was enthusiastic about this, and future plans, for research between Bristol University and the Quantock Hills AONB (and since, we have collaborated on more AHRC-funded work - see 'Fallen Fruits' and 'Know Your Bristol: Orchard Roots'). Money was secured for funding small scale projects that the Quantock Hills AONB can show add value to the day-to-day activities undertaken by the AONB staff, such as (but not restricted to) academic research. Such funding supplemented AHRC funding provided for the successful Apple Heritage Day held in October 2013, that celebrated the research I went on to do with QH AONB Service, mapping orchards in the AONB.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54466cefbeaf48.76559970</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presentation of the project outline, research questions and key findings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D7D41E67-AA03-473D-855F-F704FBB99CF2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster Presentation and question/answer session at the American Society for Environmental History, Toronto, April 2013, the international conference for environmental historians in North America and beyond.

Much interest from north American audience in a British case study of National Parks - and most were unaware that AONBs were category of landscape protection. Raised profile of my project (though it came towards the end of the 9 months, so opportunities to establish ongoing links were limited by the timeframe of the research itself)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r_79567572780cbc5ce2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>poster presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings of this research include insight into the structure and operation of national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty in the UK in the context of the enduring legacy of mid-20th Century National Parks legislation. The historical context of that legislation shaped the values and ideals of the designation of protected landscapes, which has fundamentally shaped the ways in which the British landscape looks, is experienced, and is imagined. The project set this within a broader context of environmental attitudes and thought, in modern Britain. Of note is the ongoing particularity of individual designations, eg. Quantock Hills AONB, which operate largely independently but with affiliation to the national structure. Also of note is the lack of regular or standardised archiving practices across the various NPs and AONBs - there is great discrepancy as to how records are kept, and much valuable historical material is being lost as a result.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project set the groundwork for future collaborative projects with the Quantock Hills AONB, funded by the AHRC: 'Places that Speak to Us and the Publics We Speak With' - a project which supported mapping the old and lost orchards of the Quantock Hills, which provided a publicly accessible map of historic orchards in the area which is now used in local planning decision, and the day-to-day management of the AONB. This work was subsequently built on further by connecting with the Know Your Bristol project (University of Bristol), bringing an urban orchard (Horfield Community Orchard) together with the rural orchard network of the Quantocks and holding the area's first Apple Day festival. The 9 month ECF was crucial in building the trust and connections necessary for the subsequent co-produced work (eg. the mapping was done by me, in the QH AONB offices using their equipment; Apple Day was held at their HQ in Somerset, Fyne Court). 

My findings sought to update the history of NPs, and draw attention to the role of often-overlooked AONBs in landscape protection. The short length of the ECF (9 months) limited the written outputs, but the strong working relationship developed with the AONB has led to a series of activities and outputs which have focused specifically on the presence of the AONB in local, regional and national landscapes and communities. There is still work to do on this topic. My published chapter in Coates, Moon &amp;amp; Warde, 'Local Places, Global Processes', has updated the literature on AONBs, and will draw attention to these landscapes alongside the better-known National Parks. A national focus would be the next step in exploring the issues addressed in this project, at the regional level.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>79A29BCC-EBF2-4241-8253-42958300320B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ca3a592de98.15920097</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88777A2D-44A2-46C0-8E0D-31130A014D50</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantock Orchard Project</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Exmoor Magazine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c848ba5bd3331be51d3e06afe13c2599"><gtr:id>c848ba5bd3331be51d3e06afe13c2599</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marianna Dudley</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545c9f612ec390.31698734</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6E606A64-A780-482D-B0C3-1037267B894E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fallen Fruit and Orchard Roots: Historical Orchard Research in the Quantock Hills</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeology and Natural History Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c848ba5bd3331be51d3e06afe13c2599"><gtr:id>c848ba5bd3331be51d3e06afe13c2599</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marianna Dudley</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545c8871016668.50534572</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>218CFE9A-9441-4528-BFC1-4EE0F441FB90</gtr:id><gtr:title>Local Place, Global Process: Histories of Environmental Change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c848ba5bd3331be51d3e06afe13c2599"><gtr:id>c848ba5bd3331be51d3e06afe13c2599</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marianna Dudley</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_822267188213ba75b2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D0222AA1-0AD4-4CB6-BCBB-1508EEDC028C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Traces of Conflict: Environment and Eviction in British Military Training Areas, 1943 to Present</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of War &amp; Culture Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e235e0cd4efb93309c37a19cce79f8f3"><gtr:id>e235e0cd4efb93309c37a19cce79f8f3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dudley M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07a07afd1df06</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J00734X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
