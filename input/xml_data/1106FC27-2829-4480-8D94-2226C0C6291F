This project aims to produce instantaneous temperature measurements of the highest accuracy and precision ever in model and industrial scale combustors. These precision measurements aim not only provide the basis for validation of models by industrial and academic users, but also to create a path for development of a lower cost, high precision thermometry technique for deployment in realistic combustors. 
The two key factors governing the design of continuous flow combustors are maintaining low emissions - particularly nitric oxides - and keeping the system away from thermoacoustic instabilities. The spatial and statistical distribution of burned gas temperatures is the single most important factor governing the formation of nitric oxide (NO): a local change of 50 K can lead to a change of 70% in thermal NO formation rates at typical combustion temperatures. Validation of emission prediction models is hemmed by the lack of availability of statistical and spatial information on temperatures. Thermoacoustic instabilities are created by a feedback effect in which acoustic waves generated by the unsteady acceleration of the flow during combustion in a confined environment lead to further unsteadiness in heat release. Two factors associated with the flame are important: the response of the flame to acoustic perturbation, and the generation of temperature non-uniformities (called entropy spots): the former leads directly to density fluctuations and acoustic waves, and the latter couple the boundary conditions to reflect as pressure waves. The identification of the origin of combustion instabilities is complex, as several factors can contribute fluctuations, yet usually only pressure information is available, sometimes aided by relative total heat release fluctuations via chemiluminescence. Nevertheless, statistical measurements of temperatures in either model or industrial scale gas turbine flames are relatively uncommon, because of difficulties with physical probes or optical methods relying on calibration of signal amplitudes. The proposed measurements do not rely on amplitudes, but on the measurement of signal frequency, which can be made significantly more precisely (down to errors of 0.2%) than comparable techniques. Furthermore, the present measurements will enable the direct simultaneous measurements of NO and temperature with a single laser, thus creating a unique statistical database for model validation. Finally, the technique will enable for the measurement of temperature fluctuations through a nozzle at very high precision, which has not been done previously. The high precision measurements will have a direct impact on assessing the quality of model predictions for NO and instabilities, and when translated into design codes, into the design of cleaner and more stable power and propulsion systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Gas turbine power generation is currently responsible for 40% of power in the UK, as well as the primary propulsion mode for aeroengine combustion for the foreseeable future, with the UK industry as a leading equipment supplier. The effective and fast design of low emission combustion devices depends critically on the ability of engineers to make accurate and precise predictions of gas temperatures within the combustion chamber. This project will produce instantaneous temperature measurements of the highest accuracy and precision ever in model and industrial scale combustors. These precision measurements will not only provide the basis for validation of models by industrial and academic users, but also to create a path for development of a lower cost, high precision thermometry technique for deployment in realistic combustors. 
The two key factors governing the design of continuous flow combustors are maintaining low emissions - particularly nitric oxides - and keeping the system away from thermoacoustic instabilities. Validation of emission prediction models is hemmed by the lack of availability of statistical and spatial information on temperatures. In this project, we will be able to obtain unprecedented precision in temperature measurements, as well as obtain simultaneous measurements of NO and temperature in turbulent premixed and stratified flames. This unique statistical database, which will build on a base of a very well characterized turbulent flame including all major species, will help untangle the relationship between temperature statistics and the resulting non-linearity in NO production in premixed flames. Models produced by researchers in academia and used in the design of gas turbines will be able to take advantage of this database for validation, ultimately leading to a speed up in the design and development of combustion chambers for gas turbines as well as furnaces and other devices. 
Thermoacoustic instabilities are created by a feedback effect in which acoustic waves generated by the unsteady acceleration of the flow during combustion in a confined environment lead to further unsteadiness in heat release. The prediction of thermoacoustic instabilities is a more intricate problem than the prediction of NO emissions: here many factors at play, including injector and flame aerodynamics, injector mixing characteristics, temperature non-uniformities and, in an annular combustor, the interactions between acoustics and the flames distributed around the annulus. In this proposal we isolate two leading factors, the flame response and temperature non-uniformities, to identify the relative importance as the boundary conditions are varied, in a representative single-sector combustor. The study will for the first time characterize the simultaneous temperature and pressure response of the system through the combustor and converging nozzle and be able to identify the evolution of these variables. Models for the system will be able to incorporate the actual rather than postulated spatial and time resolved variation of temperature, allowing the separation between modes, and a greater understanding of flame behaviour and flame-system interaction. 
In spite the significant advances in computational models and resources, testing of gas turbine combustor remains a necessary and expensive part of the development of new systems. A single day of tests costs upwards of hundreds of thousand pounds, and many additional man-hours in interpreting and extrapolating the results obtained. The proposed experiments will provide a significant leap forward in creating the highest precision thermometry technique, and producing detailed and statistically quantified NO and temperature measurements throughout a model combustor. Successful implementation will allow industrial designers to move forward more confidently and rapidly, reaping the benefits of lower emissions, lower instability power systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>425018</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Modelling of entropy spots using Oscilos</gtr:description><gtr:id>8338E9E4-FB02-40B8-8628-A9AE5E84A131</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) Simulation of the current rig design using Oscilos

(a) to provide the most precise temperature measurements ever in post-flame turbulent flows using an optical technique called laser-induced thermal grating spectroscopy (LITGS), which offers a direct measurement of the speed of sound, proportional to the square root of temperature;
(b) to create a method for measuring simultaneous instantaneous concentration of the pollutant nitric oxides (NO) and temperature in post flame gases;
(c) to extend the LITGS method to precisely measure temperature fluctuations during forced and self-excited combustion instabilities through a combustor.

During the course of the research in this project, a few developments at the more fundamental end of the project associated with combustion instabilities took a very productive turn as several DTA-funded students were attracted to the project, the following findings have been obtained: 

I. First direct measurements of entropy noise 
In preparation for the planned measurements of unsteady temperature fluctuations (called entropy spots) in flames, we investigated the fundamentals of noise generation by entropy spots in ducts. The investigation involved using synthetic (electrical) hotspots in a uniform turbulent flow in a duct, and measurement of the noise generated by using pressure transducers. This led to the first direct and unambiguous measurements of entropy noise, reported in a conference publication [1], and now in press [2]. The measurements demonstrated the flaws associated with previous measurements performed at DLR, and generated a database for direct comparison with the existing one-dimensional theory. 

II. Direct comparison of experiment and theory 
The existing Marble and Candel [3] theory of noise production by entropy spots was tested against the new experimental pressure and temperature data [4,5]. The measurements showed that the isentropic theory cannot account for the relatively high backward propagating noise, and low transmitted noise. A new paper shows that non-isentropic effects must be taken account in order to reproduce the results. New experiments show that the shape of the converging nozzle behaves isentropically, but the non-isentropic dissipation affects both the up- and downstream propagation of entropic noise [5]. 

III. First experiments on compositional noise 
A recent theory developed by Magri et al. [6] suggested that the acceleration of gases with different composition (not only temperature) might generate noise. This is relevant for the thermoacoustic instabilities generated by the fluctuation of gases with different composition through turbine nozzles, such as cooling air and burned gases. We used the experimental setup for the entropic noise to generate experiments to specifically test the theory, using helium gas as the test gas. The comparison of the experimental results with the theory showed that indeed unless the compositional noise is included, it is not possible to account for the noise [6].

IV. CFD simulations of entropic noise 
CFD simulations of the simplified synthetic entropy noise using the open source software OpenFoam have been made. Preliminary simulations aim to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach to capture the acoustic behaviour of the open system, as well as the temperature of the gases along the duct. This has been achieved, and demonstrated the need for additional computational resources, which have been applied for. This work is being supported in part by Rolls-Royce via a student supplemental fellowship. 

V. OH/LITGS in high pressure turbulent flames 
Measurements of flame temperatures using OH/LITGS have been achieved in high pressure (5 bar) oxygen-enriched flames. The measurements were made by the Cambridge group at the high- pressure combustion facility at Tohoku university, in collaboration with Prof. A. Hayakawa, who was a visitor at Cambridge during 2015-2016. The results have been presented at the 54th Symposium (Japanese) on Combustion, and won the best poster award. Although Latzel et al. showed LITGS measurements in laminar, high pressure burners at very high pressures [15], the new experiments showed that indeed it is possible to use OH as a LITGS absorber in enriched oxygen flames at moderate (5 bar) pressures in oxygen-enriched environments, which increase NO concentrations. The continuing collaboration will lead to measurements on the Tohoku high pressure turbulent flame once the data acquisition systems are upgraded [9]. A computer model for DFWM spectra, based on the analytical theory developed by Ewart et al. has been developed in MATLAB for spectral analysis and tested on experimental DFWM spectra of flame OH.

VI. NO LITGS feasibility 
The Cambridge group has carried out a comprehensive set of LITGS measurements using NO as the absorber in a high- pressure cell over a range of temperatures and pressures, in order to understand how the LITGS signal varies, ahead of deploying it to high temperatures in flames. A limited set of measurements on an atmospheric pressure flame enriched with NO-doped diluent (to simulate higher pressures) were produced. The LITGS signal was produced using an absorption line around 226 nm. 
A more extensive series of experiments performed at Oxford, using a similar excitation scheme, has studied spatially resolved LIGS and DFWM in both cells and laminar flames over a range of stoichiometry, pressure and temperature. Work is continuing to derive the concentration of combustion-generated NO in the flame. More fundamental studies have investigated the transformation of DFWM signals in NO to signals dominated by LITGS by recording simultaneously the DFWM signal and a LITGS signal generated by a non-resonant probe. Cell-based LITGS measurements indicate that NO can be detected at concentrations down to around 100 ppm and temperatures measured with precision of &amp;lt;1% in the range 300 - 400 K. Using LITGS the spatially resolved temperature has been measured in CH4/O2/N2 flames at pressures up to 3 bar. Publications are currently being prepared to report the main findings of this work. Therefore, simultaneous measurements of NO and temperatures in flames are possible primarily in high pressure systems, and in general not in typical atmospheric hydrocarbon flames. 

VII. Acetone and toluene LITGS signal characterization 
For good absorbers such as previously used acetone and toluene, the product of concentration and laser power must be sufficiently small in order to avoid a local temperature rise, and consequently affect the local temperature measurements. These results are being generalized for these substances, as a generalized criterion for future experiments. 

In addition, while waiting for components to arrive during the project, the RA associated with the project (Yi Gao) has lent her laser expertise to two other PhD students and collaborated with a second RA. These related activities have come to the the following findings: 
(i) A combined technique using laser induced incandescence and extinction measurements has demonstrated the feasibility of measurements of soot down to sub-parts per million, by using a mirrored cavity approach [10] 
(ii) Measurements of the hydroxyl radical OH, Mie scatter of particles and laser induced incandescence have been made in coal-CO2-O2 flames, demonstrating their feasibility n a model burner for the first time, and providing a database for the role of CO2-O2 on coal combustion [11].
(iii) Simultaneous temperature and velocity field measurements using laser induced phosphorescence: this is a related development in which we are considering the advantages and disadvantages of LITGS relatively to other techniques. Here we demonstrated the ability of producing velocity and temperature fields using a single double-pulsed laser and two cameras with different filters [12-14]

Entropy and compositional spots: theory and experiments
We have now developed a robust and standardized way of generating entropic disturbances, which has led to a validation of parts of the theory, and invalidation of other parts. Both of these are useful in understanding how noise is generated in gas turbines. The findings attracted the attention of collaborators at Rolls-Royce, who are now partly funding the work of a PhD student, Jocelino Rodrigues. The exposure of the work at various conferences has also led to an invited talk on the subject at the upcoming International Conference on Sound and Vibration. The validation of the brand new theories on compositional noise will aid in the understanding of noise generation and transmission through gas turbines. The collaboration with Rolls-Royce is currently leading to the incorporation of corrections to entropic thermoacoustic models. Further work from the CFD models can help design nozzle guide vanes to minimize thermoacoustic oscillations. 

2. OH LIGTS in high pressure flames
The preliminary work of Ewart and others allowed the production of OH LITGS in high pressure oxyfuel flames up to 5 bar. This de-risks the application of the technique to other situations, by quantifying the signal strength as a function of pressure and temperature. The OH concentrations in typical post-flame conditions are still relatively low, so the amount of signal that can be realistically obtained depends on the pressure. The data acquired in the present experiments will allow a better quantification of the realistic signal that can be obtained for OH in the product gases, thus allowing robust identification of situations where it can be used as an absorber for a given concentration and temperature. 

3. NO LIGTS 
Experiments with low temperature, high pressure, and high temperature ambient pressure NO showed that it is possible to obtain LITGS signal from NO species. However, ambient pressure, high temperature measurements are not conducive to sufficient signal to noise for robust determinations. With the current database, it is possible to determine at what conditions LITGS signals can be obtained, again de-risking the application of the technique to flame temperatures. 

4. Toluene and acetone signal behaviour 
The models of LITGS developed at Oxford allow researchers to make predictions of the signal from LITGS diagnostics. The detailed data generated for acetone and toluene as a function of concentration serve as a database for further developing the energy transfer models for use of these and other molecules as absorber gases.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D40AD453-DB60-432D-A57F-3078A17D4534</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d328570d9cf1.51934420</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
