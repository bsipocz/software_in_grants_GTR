The years 1919-1939 were a period in which environment pressure, agricultural decline and changes in the nature of the rural population created a widespread sensitivity towards the rural landscape. A central notion held by many contemporaries was that the very countryside itself as a livid socio-environmental system was under threat from, for example, urban sprawl, rural poverty, the growth of tourism, continued declinein the numbers in agriculture and the collapse of traditional social and cultural structures. This perception of a rural crisis was rooted first in the accounts of social and economic decline-the idea that agriculture was 'finished' as a viable industry. With this concept of the 'end' of agriculture, the organic social structures of farm, village and landscape, which it had supported, themselves came under threat. Yet, at the same time, there was also a positive attitude to rural areas. For many people from the towns the countryside became a site of leisure- the chance to escape from the city and the round of work. To yet another group, mainlyalthough not entirely from the prosperous areas of the south-east, the interwar period gave a chance to live if not in the country then at least ina leafy 'suburban landscape'. This product complex reactions from a variety of writers, artists, painters, musicians and film makers, as well as the farming community, the new country 'trippers' on foot or on bike, or those who sought a rural idyll in the country districts. Int he interwar-period, the English countryside assumed a widespread cultural significance but one which was contested rather than consensual.\n\nThe method adopted by the network will be interdisciplinary- to bring together scholars from across the Arts and Humanities in a series of seminars which will focus on key themes; imagining the village, genderinhg the landscape, new countrymen and women living in the landscape. Each seminar will invite participants from different disciplines to present papaers and discussion documents from within their discrete subject areas around common questions. These include ideas of the representation of crisis and 'threat', both visual and literacy; the historical and geographical constructions of landscape and environment; the 'experience' of those who lived through the period; and the responses of different sectors within the rural and urban areas. The research will also be informed by the different regional experiences of crisis. The seminars are designed to be developmental, in that by bringing together new researchers (especially postgraduates) with more established scholars, the network encourages both groups to benefit from working in a long-term co-operative intellectual environment.\n\nThe seminars will produce the beginnings of a new synthesis in which the cultural and social meetings of the inter-war English countryside can be understood from a variety of perspectives. This will open the way for a new research agenda across the Arts and Humanities as well a providing a challenge to the conventional and contemporary notions of decline and failure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23144</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E502741/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
