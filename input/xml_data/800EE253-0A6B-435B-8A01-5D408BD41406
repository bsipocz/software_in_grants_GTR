These facets depend on proteins called glutamate receptor ion channels (iGluRs). iGluRs, more specifically AMPA and NMDA receptors, are indispensable for the conveying or regulating the transfer of information between nerve cells at contacts called synapses. Recently, a large number of mutations have been discovered in the genes giving rise to NMDA and AMPA receptors. Some of these mutations cause mental and seizure disorders. However, many others occur in healthy individuals and are often referred to as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). These genetic changes modify critical parts of the iGluR protein but their effects on the function of iGluRs and synapses are unknown. We need to understand how these genetic changes impact synapse function, cause mental and seizure disorders and modify the action of drugs targeting iGluRs. 

The aims of this project are: 1) To identify human SNPs of potential significance to AMPA and NMDA receptor function and drug action; 2) To determine to what extent mutations and SNPs in AMPA and NMDA receptors alter synapse function in health and disease; 3) To evaluate interactions between AMPA receptor SNPs and drugs targeting AMPA receptors. The research will be carried out within Sussex Neuroscience at the University of Sussex (UoS). Aim 1 will be achieved using publically available molecular datasets and variety of computer-based approaches to identify SNPs with potential impact on iGluR function. Aims 2 and 3 will be achieved in the lab by replacing native iGluRs with the human iGluR mutants or SNPs in nerve cells of cultured mouse brain slices and measuring the impact of genetic changes in iGluRs on properties of synapse function or the effectiveness of AMPA receptor-targetting drugs. Parts of aims 1 and 3 will be achieved in collaboration with the Translational Drug Discovery Group (TDDG) based at the UoS, who are developing a drug that targets the AMPA receptor with an outlook to treating cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. 

The project will make key contributions to our understanding of how synapses work. In addition, this project has two likely clinical benefits. First, it will detail iGluR-linked disease mechanisms to support genetic counseling of patients who have iGluR mutations and associated brain disorders (autism, mental disability and epilepsy). Second, the project will evaluate the effectiveness of iGluR-targeting therapeutics. Drugs acting allosterically to modulate AMPA receptor function continue to be of intense interest in drug discovery. For example, the Translational Drug Discovery Group (TDDG) at the University of Sussex (UoS) has received a &amp;pound;4 million grant to develop potentiators for the restoration of glutamatergic system function in mental disorders. Furthermore, the AMPA receptor antagonist Fycompa (perampanel) is now used in the clinic to treat seizure disorders. In this proposal, aim 3 will address how SNPs in human AMPA receptor genes alter the effectiveness of AMPA receptor drugs and the findings could guide personalised or stratified medicine in the treatments of these disorders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Glutamate receptor ion channels (iGluRs) are essential for relaying and storing information at excitatory synapses in the brain. A considerable number of disease-linked point mutations and non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human iGluR genes have been reported and deposited in public databases. My in silico research indicates that these genetic variants are distributed within sequences coding for functionally crucial domains of the iGluR structure but their effects on synapse function are unknown. We need to understand how these sequence changes impact on iGluRs to alter synaptic function and cause disease. In this project, I will investigate the effects of disease-causing point mutations and SNPs in human iGluRs on the basic functions of synapses and response to AMPA receptor-targetting drugs. Mutated AMPA NMDA receptors will be introduced by single-cell molecular replacement into CA1 neurons of cultured hippocampal slices from established floxed iGluR mouse lines. Receptor and synaptic function will be measured in excised patches and whole-cell recording respectively. The key goals of this project are:
1) To identify human genetic variation of potential significance to AMPA and NMDA receptor function and pharmacology using bioinformatics approaches
2) To determine how synaptic transmission is altered by genetic changes in AMPA and NMDA receptors and understand the synaptic basis of disease-causing mutations
3) To evaluate interactions between AMPA receptor SNPs and allosteric modulators</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outcomes of this research project will have a range of non-academic beneficiaries.

The General Public. About 1 in 100 people in the UK have epilepsy, with only half of these being effectively treated (https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/press/facts). Furthermore, every year 1 in 4 people experience mental health problems (http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-statistics/). As my proposal addresses the mechanisms and treatments of these diseases, my research could be of interest to the general public, who will likely know someone with one of these conditions. In my communication efforts I will take steps to make the general public aware about how laboratory science research makes fundamental contributions to understanding disease mechanisms and identify promising targets for drug discovery. In addition, projecting enthusiasm and promoting research to the public, in particular the next generation, is vital to attracting the brightest and best to the future workforce in life sciences and medical research. Ultimately, the general public will see the benefits from this (and other) translation research projects through their impact on healthcare service and drug therapies.

Healthcare professionals and health service. The research from this project will benefit health and well-being in two ways. Firstly, this project will detail disease mechanisms, which will provide information to support the genetic counseling of patients with iGluR-linked brain disorders. iGluR mutations have been discovered at an average rate of more than 10 new familial or de novo cases per year since 2007. Of the most prolific targets, the NMDA receptor GRIN2A gene has about 50 point mutations (de novo or familial) discovered in patients with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, epilepsies, speech or language dysfunction or melanoma. Second, the project will evaluate the effectiveness of AMPA receptor-targetting therapeutics. Drugs acting on AMPA receptors are beginning to reach the clinic. For example, the AMPA receptor antagonist Fycompa (perampanel) is currently used to treat partial seizures. I will also investigate how SNPs in human AMPA receptor genes alter the effectiveness of AMPA receptor drugs and the findings could guide healthcare policy and implementation of personalised or stratified medicines in the treatments of these disorders.

Industry and collaborators. I expect that my work on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their interactions with drug therapies targeting glutamate receptors will be of interest to those managing research and development in the drug discovery industry. I anticipate interest in findings that would relate to the impact of AMPA receptor modulators on synaptic function. Specifically, their is a potential impact of common SNPs in binding pockets on the effectiveness of AMPA receptor drugs to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission. During this project I will collaborate with the Translational Drug Discovery Group (TDDG) at the UoS to add another dimension to researching these objectives. The TDDG has recently commenced a 3-year Wellcome Trust-funded project to identify an AMPA receptor modulator suitable for treating cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. My work will complement and synergise with the TDDG and should provide valuable insights into the possibilities for patient stratification and/or personalised medicine once clinical trials commence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1135815</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sussex</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Computational chemistry to predict effects of human SNPs on AMPA receptor ligand-binding domain function and pharmacology</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB1A8C2B-96B1-4260-8EA7-9B3EE02F8C7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results from this collaboration indicate some SNPs could modify the binding of AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators.
