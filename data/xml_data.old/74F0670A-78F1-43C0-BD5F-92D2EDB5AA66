The report identified a number of challenges and identified that researchers with training in public engagement are both more likely to work with public audiences and partners, and more likely to deliver high quality engagement activities. 

This proposal addresses the prioritised challenge: 'Enhancing the take up of training and CPD for PER, and the quality of provision. What are the barriers which lead to low uptake of training and CPD in PER, and how might these be addressed?'

We will take advantage of a very recent change in our institutional context, which will enable us to embed enhanced training/CPD support for PER within a re-imagined professional development provision for researchers and academic staff. Resources are already committed within the institution to further develop a more distributed model of development that will draw on excellence and expertise residing in Faculties and Academic Units at Southampton. The project will bring together colleagues from the Public Engagement with Research unit (PERu), the newly formed Centre for Higher Education Practice (CHEP), and researchers and academic staff working within a cross disciplinary theme, in collaborative work to review training/CPD needs and then design and pilot new/enhanced development approaches and interventions. This work will catalyse the review, design, provision and embedding of PER training/CPD more broadly, as well as informing the broader CHEP mission to develop a distributed, collaborative model for researcher and academic development.

In the longer term, we aim to transform professional development at Southampton, so that development is seen as a co-created, co-delivered and co-owned enterprise that benefits all staff across the institution at all levels. PER professional development, as a result of this project, will be embedded, encountered &amp;quot;routinely&amp;quot;, valued, and impactful. These impacts will be transferrable across different disciplines, departments and across the sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In 2015, RCUK and Wellcome commissioned a report exploring what the sum of evidence tells us about the current key highlights, barriers and challenges for public engagement in the research and Higher Education sector. The report identified a number of challenges. This project is a response to one of the prioritised challenges, &amp;quot;Enhancing the take up of training and CPD for PER, and the quality of provision.&amp;quot;

Researchers with training in public engagement are both more likely to work with public audiences and partners, and more likely to deliver high quality engagement activities. Universities should endeavour to provide, and stimulate demand for, effective professional development support for PER. Professional development should be delivered in a range of formats that suits individual preferences and different disciplinary contexts. Development opportunities must be flexible, accessible and timely.

The key questions are, what are the barriers which lead to low uptake of training and CPD in PER, and how might these be addressed?

We will investigate these questions within the context of our institution, and work with the new Centre for Higher Education Practice to pilot interventions. Our aim is to integrate professional development and training for PER in our academic practice development programmes, so that PER is &amp;quot;routinely encountered&amp;quot; as staff progress through development across a range of contexts, and that development is available for staff at different levels of seniority. We will evaluate these interventions and publish a briefing document for dissemination across the HE sector which will include recommendations for next steps. 

The immediate beneficiaries of the project will be researchers at the University of Southampton, who will develop enhanced skills and experience in PER. As an institution, Southampton will develop increased capacity for PER professional development and a sustainable model for the future. In the medium-term, benefits will extend to researchers and institutions across the sector. Potentially within the life-time of the project, but more likely over time, as a cohort of well-trained researchers work with public audiences and partners, the mutual benefit of high-quality public engagement will be maximised.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46718</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019789/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
