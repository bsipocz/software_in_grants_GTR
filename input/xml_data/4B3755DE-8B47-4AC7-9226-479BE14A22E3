but uninfected children</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/K023446/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>BACKGROUND 
 
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem for children and adults. One of the characteristics of TB is that the bacteria that cause it can stay within the body for many years after infection, and re-activate and cause disease later in life. TB vaccine research is therefore complicated because people need to be followed-up for many years to see whether or not they eventually develop the disease. It's also unclear what sort of immune response is the most protective against TB, and therefore how best to design and test new vaccines. 
 
The World Health Organization is aiming for zero childhood TB deaths and to eliminate the disease by 2050. Identifying an effective immune response and markers in the blood that correspond to protection against TB, would dramatically speed up development and implementation of new vaccines, which is key to achieving these goals. 
 
TB IN CHILDREN 
 
Children are normally exposed to TB bacteria by a coughing infected adult living in their home. Children's responses vary. Some of these children become unwell with TB disease, others are healthy but infected, whilst a third group shows no signs of infection. Children who are healthy but infected are at risk of TB re-activating later in life and causing disease. 
 
We aim to answer the question: 
 
Why do some children exposed to TB show no signs of infection, whilst others in the same household become infected? 
 
To understand the protective mechanisms, this research will compare immune responses in blood from children in the Gambia: 
 
1. Children exposed to TB who are &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; 
2. Siblings exposed to TB who are infected 
3. Healthy children from the community 
 
By comparing &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; children to their infected siblings in the same household and to matched health children from the community, many factors that can influence TB, such as age, nutrition, genetic background, degree of exposure to TB and so on will be taken into account, enabling us to focus on specific questions. 
 
AIM ONE 
 
We will first confirm a previous finding that in laboratory testing, blood from &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; children is better at killing the bacteria that cause TB. This is important because it will show that there is a test we can carry out in the laboratory that corresponds to the clinical differences between the groups of children. There are several possible explanations for this difference. 
 
AIM TWO 
 
TB infects immune cells and can live within them. It is thought that if infected immune cells die in a carefully regulated process (known as apoptosis), the spread of TB is limited. If the infected TB cell dies in an uncontrolled manner (known as necrosis) the bacteria can multiply more easily and spread rapidly. We will use blood to see if immune cells from &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; children are more likely to die by apoptosis when infected with TB in the laboratory. 
 
The balance of chemicals that promote or suppress inflammation is an explanation for why some infected cells die by apoptosis or necrosis and potentially why some children are protected against TB infection. We will therefore measure the production of a range of these chemicals in blood in response to infection with TB in the laboratory. 
 
AIM THREE 
 
Having identified inflammatory chemicals that are implicated in protection against TB in children, we can investigate this further by adding specific drugs to blood infected in the laboratory and measure whether it affects killing of bacteria or the manner in which cells die following infection. This will help us to be more certain that what we have seen has a causative impact. 
 
POTENTIAL OUTCOMES 
 
The information gathered from this research project has potential to help test vaccines currently in production, guide development of new vaccines, and see whether addition of medicines that influence inflammation can be helpful in addition to direct anti-TB drugs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Why do some children exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) show no signs of infection, whilst others in the same household become latently infected? 
 
We aim to define protective host immune mechanisms against infection by M.tb through characterizing differences between clinical phenotypes in an established household case-contact platform in The Gambia: 
 
1. TB-exposed children without signs of M.tb infection (&amp;quot;protected&amp;quot;), 
2. their latently infected siblings (&amp;quot;susceptible&amp;quot;), 
3. age-matched but TB-unexposed community &amp;quot;controls.&amp;quot; 
 
We hypothesize that &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; siblings restrict mycobacterial growth more than their &amp;quot;susceptible&amp;quot; siblings and that this reflects cell death and linked eicosanoid pathways. 
 
Aim 1: To validate pilot data that &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; children inhibit mycobacterial growth more than &amp;quot;susceptible siblings&amp;quot; 
 
Methods 1: Whole blood reporter-gene tagged M.tb infection with calculation of growth ratios. 
 
Aim 2: To measure cellular and inflammatory differences in responses of blood from &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;susceptible&amp;quot; children to M.tb infection. 
 
Aim 2.1: To compare monocyte cell death modality. 
 
Methods 2.1: M.tb-infected monocytes will be evaluated for apoptosis by (a) Flow cytometry and (b) Cell-death detection ELISAPLUS immunoassay. 
 
Aim 2.2: To use an unbiased lipidomics approach to evaluate lipid mediator profiles. 
 
Methods 2.2: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) will quantify lipid inflammatory mediators. 
 
Aim 3: Manipulation of lipid mediators of interest in M.tb infection to provide mechanistic insight. 
 
Methods 3: Following analysis of Aim 2.2 data, selected drugs will be tested for impact upon mycobacterial growth, cell death modality and lipid mediators. 
 
OPPORTUNITIES 
 
The protective markers identified will aid vaccine evaluation, whilst the lipidomics opens avenues to investigate immunomodulation in TB.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>CHILDREN AT RISK OF TB
Children across the world are the primary intended beneficiaries of this fellowship proposal. There are manifold potential benefits for paediatric health. Markers of protection can provide a fundamental step forward in the development of a better vaccine to prevent infection and disease in TB, thereby helping to meet the goals of zero childhood TB deaths. Understanding the role of inflammation, and using a discovery-generating approach such as lipidomics will further the rapidly burgeoning field of understanding susceptibility to TB. Furthermore treatment of TB may be advanced with immunomodulatory adjunctive treatments to directly anti-tuberculous therapy. 

ADULTS AT RISK OF TB
It is not only children who have the potential to benefit from this study, but adults too. Adults with pulmonary TB and a high bacillary burden are the primary mode of transmission to both children and adults. By understanding prevention of infection through this fellowship proposal, vaccines that prevent latent infection, and thereby subsequent reactivation in disease in adult populations will both prevent cases directly, but also prevent transmission, thereby having a dramatic effect upon TB epidemiology.

THE GAMBIAN AND WEST AFRICAN PUBLIC
The people of Gambia and West African region will directly and indirectly benefit from the MRC's investment in resources and people at the MRC Unit in The Gambia. This will come about through the skills development of those involved directly in working on the Fellowship, as well as indirectly through ancillary staff and broader economic impacts upon the community around the Unit. It will also contribute to the excellent track record of high quality research and scientific endeavour in The Gambia and the region as a whole.

THE UK 
Particularly in urban areas of the UK, both children and adults are vulnerable to TB and therefore will share in the intended health benefits. Furthermore, the country as a whole will benefit from the high profile investment and collaboration by the MRC into its long-established partnerships with West Africa, promoting the UK as an outward-looking and supportive international leader.

NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY-MAKERS
This Fellowship proposal is grounded in the research priorities set by the World Health Organization to meet their goals of zero childhood TB deaths and elimination of the disease by 2050. The research outputs generated will feed back into the policy-makers' arena through driving the research agenda, funding streams, and guiding vaccine development. 

INDUSTRY
Translation of markers of protection identified into a format that can be rapidly employed in clinical vaccine trials, and development of novel vaccines guided by protective phenotypes identified will be driven through academic collaboration with industry. 

MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL
This Fellowship proposal compliments all four components of the mission of the MRC through aiming to improve human health and wellbeing; training a clinician in scientific research at the highest level; improving the quality of life and economic competitiveness of the UK through protecting children in high prevalence TB urban areas within the UK and the benefits to industry; and promoting dialogue with the public through the communication plan. It also fits with the MRC's Strategic Aim One Research Priority Theme One - Natural Protection within Resilience, Repair and Replacement. It is also in perfect sync with Strategic Aim Three - accelerating progress in international health research. Through the funding of the CTRF and supporting a further collaboration with the existing centre of excellence, The MRC Unit, The Gambia, existing streams of support and investment by the MRC can be strengthened and combined.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234420</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Film has a unique capacity to fire the imagination, to make real the abstract, and to sweep the viewer alongside the protagonist on their journey. Movies provide an accessible, vivid and collective experience that triggers both shared emotions and contrasting perspectives. 

It therefore offers a remarkable opportunity to bring together disparate groups in a non-threatening environment enabling interdisciplinary discussion of shared experience.

We have been showing films from the Cinema of Childhood season and pairing them with interdisciplinary panel discussions about the Arts and Child Health. Partners have included The Royal Society of Medicine, Institute of Education, The College of Social Work, and Association of Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Mental Health.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3CF6ED7B-3E18-4FEA-BB93-927022528F56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Illustrative quotes from attending screenings followed by child well-being discussions:
 
&amp;quot;I thought the film and discussion were awesome... as I said, one of the best and coolest things I've done in London. I thought it was well-attended and the combination of a kick-ass panel and engaged audience meant for a really great conversation. Loved it. Thanks tons.&amp;quot; 

(From a professional working with blind children having watched The Unseen with her son):
&amp;quot;This is a fantastic film series and I would like to say thanks and congratulations for yesterday's event. 
It took a little persuading to get my son along but the experience inspired him to decide that we would walk home across the park from the Tube, with him leading me and giving an audio description along the way. I had to keep my eyes shut and did. This was a very interesting experience and made me realise that although I have dabbled with trying to do certain tasks without sight, that this was the first time I had been set the task of doing it for so long. Upon our arrival home he got me to make a cup of tea still sightless, and then set me to identifying certain things from the kitchen table still without sight.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;the only other time you'd get a group like this together is if it was a child protection case review&amp;quot; 

&amp;quot;the opportunity to reflect on childhood issues when there isn't direct professional involvement. It makes it both less real (and therefore easier to discuss), but also more real because film immerses you in the child's experience in a way that no clinic or ward encounter could ever do.&amp;quot; 

&amp;quot;the film-discussion format is a great teaching resource and a valid alternative to observing people (patients) in the clinic setting. It allows a much larger group than could be accommodated in a clinic, to discuss and form hypotheses or formulations about people's behaviour from direct observation. Getting people to think about what they have seen is a great way to train healthcare professionals and medical educators to develop a more psychologised practice. Essential in paediatrics.&amp;quot;

The training module is an up to date and scientifically sound material developed by the Childhood TB Program and spans the epidemiological, clinical, social and operational issues surrounding childhood TB with special emphasis on the Gambian context.

Reach4Kids Training targets Clinicians, Local leprosy/TB inspectors and other staff of TB clinics, Outpatient nurses, Reproductive and Child health staff, Community Health nurses and other healthcare workers who deal with sick children in their routine work in the Upper River, Central River, Lower River and North bank regions of The Gambia. Due to funding limitations, these areas were not covered during an initial training project of the Childhood TB team, which concentrated on health workers in the West Coast Region.

Training is delivered over 2 days as a series of didactic teachings, interactive sessions, group activities and role plays. Nearly 120 health workers have already been trained in the first round of training across the 4 regions. A second round will commence later in November and will cover other nominated health workers who could not attend the first round.

It is expected that the knowledge and skills acquired by health workers in this training will help them recognise and properly manage or refer more children sick with TB. This way, many more lives of children with TB will be saved and many more children will be prevented from having the disease in the first place. Working directly with the Government of the Gambia through the NLTP has placed this training grant in a vantage position to swiftly impact policy as the results and the impacts of the training are being shared in real time.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c102552a6c95.35152091</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.mrc.gm/the-tdr-childhood-tb-impact-training-takes-off-in-earnest/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Case accepted for Walter Marget Workshop, European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7CB670A-6F20-4364-A6EB-079A36E6BFE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Attending and presenting case to audience of young paediatricians specialising in Paediatric Infectious Diseases based on clinical experiences in The Gambia, where I was based for my clinical research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c01ced584553.84070290</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.espid.org/content.aspx?Group=education&amp;Page=espid%20walter%20marget%20workshop%20guidelines_updated%20dec%202016</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited to be Paediatric TB Network Representative on TBNET Academy in Armenia</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F12BAA38-57EF-4AA8-9515-A84D48B4B9C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to be the paediatric TB network representative on this TBNET training academy that takes place in Eastern Europe every year (where the burden of MDR-TB is highest in Europe)

3-Day Tuberculosis Academy especially for students, residents, fellows, doctoral students and post-docs (up to 3 years post exam).
A forum for young clinicians and researchers in the field of tuberculosis to exchange ideas and to learn from each other under expert guidance and mentorship. The TBnet Academy 2017 will take place in Yerevan, Armenia.

 

Please find the application form by clicking on the image below.

Deadline for application is 24th February 2017

The TBNET academy provides an excellent forum for 20 young European clinicians and researchers in the field of tuberculosis to exchange ideas and to learn from each other under expert guidance and mentorship. It is a very good opportunity for upcoming researchers to participate in a pan-European research network, to get to know colleagues in the same field from different parts of Europe and to plan future collaborations.
 
Everyone who will take part in the TBNET Academy will have an active role. Participants will be selected on basis of their motivation letter, research experience and career plans. They can choose among 5 categories:
 
1. TB Epidemiology
2. TB diagnostics
3. TB Prevention
4. TB treatment
5. Clinical pearls (case reports)
 
and will be asked to provide a state-of-the-art lecture on their topic or clinical case report together with colleagues from other countries. The presentations will be prepared under guidance of experienced mentors. Apart from keynote lectures and career development sessions there will be a teaching ward round at the national MDR-TB center and visit to the national TB laboratory.
 
The TBNET Academy is open for interested medical students who perform research in the area of tuberculosis or NTM diseases . Clinicans and scientists who apply should have had their last academic exam within 3 years of the application. Distributed representation of participants throughout Europe will be ensured. Participation in the TBNET Academy will be funded with travel/accommodation stipends up to the amount of 500 Euros per person. Travel and accommodation will be booked by the TBNET office for those 20 applicants who will be selected.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c019422ffce8.04700536</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced
