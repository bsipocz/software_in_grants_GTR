The aim of the project is to increase the flow of knowledge between scientists, government and the wider farming community in order to inform the management of bovine TB at a regional level. We aim to facilitate knowledge exchange in both directions between these groups, such that the farming community is given the scientific information and advice they need, while also ensuring that research and policy meet the needs of end users and has real impact. 

Why bovine TB?
Bovine TB is a chronic disease in cattle which is one of the greatest challenges facing the cattle and farming industry in the UK, particularly in South-west England. The disease has rapidly increased in recent decades and has a high cost to individual farmers and to the government.

Why do we need stronger links between scientists and the farming community?
To date the management of bovine tb has largely been undertaken at a national level and has been informed by research undertaken by government agencies and academic institutions. More recently there has been a shift towards a regional approach to disease management and to an emphasis on individual decisions within the farming industry. Bovine TB has been intensively studied by the scientific community and a wealth of data is collected by government and other institutions which could be used to inform such decisions. However, historically there has been a barrier to knowledge flow from scientists to government to stakeholders affected by this disease. Information is not always readily available to a non-scientific audience and research is not always undertaken with a focus on practical applications. As a consequence, the farming community have had to rely on other information sources (media and their own experiences), which are disconnected from scientific evidence base. This project aims to bridge the gap, such that scientific information and advances can be turned into real practical solutions, and so that the farming community is equipped with the information they need to manage this disease. 

What will the project involve?
They key to this project is communication of knowledge and the creation of collaborative relationship between scientist, government and other stakeholders. We will use the TB eradication groups as a forum to engage with key stakeholder groups (farmers / vets/ those in the farming industry) who are directly affected by the disease. By listening closely to these groups and engaging in regular meetings, we aim to identify knowledge gaps and avenues for future investigation and research. Through links with scientists and government we will then work with these stakeholder groups towards answering these questions and filling these knowledge gaps. Crucially, stakeholders will be involved in this process in a truly collaborative way, which ensures the production of scientific information and advice which is tailored to their needs and situation. Working with the University of Exeter and also within the Animal and Plant Health Agency, I will draw together a broad range of scientific expertise and data. I will act as an as an environmental analyst, co-creating the evidence that the TB eradication groups require to deliberate upon bTB control methods. Exact research areas will depend on stakeholder needs and requirements, but will likely focus on badger ecology/management and environmental correlates of bovine TB risk. By developing data, producing tailored information and investigating research questions which are focused on the needs of the farming community, this fellowship aims to increase the availability and 'impact' of science to improve the management bovine TB.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150298</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P006396/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A502D25A-BB70-4F74-844D-32A2BAD075A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Diseases</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
