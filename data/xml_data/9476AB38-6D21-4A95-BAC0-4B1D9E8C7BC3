Nitrogen is the major fertiliser required for crop production. In the recent past, nitrogen fertiliser has been added to crops in an inorganic form, as an ammonium salt. Ammonia is converted to nitrate by two groups of soil microorganisms in a process termed nitrification: ammonia oxidisers convert ammonia to nitrite, which is converted to nitrite by nitrite oxidisers. Ammonium is retained within the soil but nitrate is readily leached and can accumulate to high, polluting levels in groundwater used to supply drinking water. In addition, ammonia oxidation is accompanied by production of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, which is also produced by reduction of nitrate. Nitrification therefore leads to pollution and to significant losses of applied nitrogen fertiliser. Nitrogen fertiliser loss can be reduced by application of nitrification inhibitors with inorganic fertilisers or by use of fertilisers which release ammonia slowly, such as composted manure. Until recently it was believed that the most important soil ammonia oxidisers were bacteria. However, this view was overturned by the recent discovery of organisms belonging to another microbial domain, the archaea, which can also oxidise ammonia. These organisms belong to a subgroup of archaea, the crenarchaea, which are present in all soils but which have never been isolated in the laboratory. We therefore require cultivation-independent, molecular techniques to assess their presence and importance. These techniques show that ammonia oxidising crenarchaea are usually more abundant than ammonia oxidising bacteria and also appear to have greater activity. There is also evidence that they may prefer lower ammonia concentrations than bacteria. Inorganic nitrogen fertilisers generate high concentrations and crenarchaeal ammonia oxidisers may therefore have a bigger role in nitrification in sustainable systems, using organic fertiliser. To determine the importance of crenarchaeal ammonia oxidisers, we will use a combination of field studies, microcosms and physiological experiments to address four objectives. 1. Determination of the relative responses of bacterial and crenarchaeal ammonia oxidisers to ammonia concentration. 2. Determination of whether different fertilisers select for different ammonia oxidiser communities. 3. Assessment of conversion of different fertilisers by bacteria and crenarchaea. 4. Determination of contributions of crenarchaea and bacterial to ammonia oxidation in subsoils. 5. Determination of relative sensitivities of crenarchaea and bacteria to nitrification inhibitors. We will determine the abundances and activities of ammonia oxidising bacteria and crenarchaea in two field sites, with contrasting soils, that have been treated for many years with either inorganic N fertiliser or composted manure. Molecular techniques will be used to determine the population sizes of the two microbial groups. Activity will be investigated by quantification of the levels of expression of amoA, a key gene in ammonia oxidation that encodes part of the protein ammonia monooxygenase. The influence of different fertilisers and of nitrification inhibitors will be investigated using cells extracted from the different soils and in small-scale soil microcosms. We will also use molecular techniques to determine whether particular subgroups within ammonia oxidising bacteria or archaea are influenced differently by ammonia concentration or by nitrification inhibitors. The findings will benefit those in agriculture, environmental agencies and industry by increasing understanding of the roles of microorganisms in nitrogen fertiliser loss and the impacts of different microbial groups on nitrification in traditional and sustainable systems and in subsoils. The findings will also be important to researchers and environmentalists interested in the links between biodiversity and ecosystem function.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Nitrification leads to significant losses of ammonia-based fertilisers which can be reduced by sustainable strategies, including use of slow-release fertilisers or inhibitors. Our understanding of factors determining losses and benefits of alternative fertilisation strategies is based on the assumption that bacteria are responsible for nitrification in agricultural soils and that cultivated bacterial ammonia oxidisers represent natural communities. Molecular techniques have demonstrated much greater diversity than laboratory cultures and led to the discovery that non-thermophilic crenarchaea can oxidise ammonia and may be more important in controlling nitrification and fertiliser loss. There is a belief, and some evidence, that crenarchaeal ammonia oxidisers prefer lower ammonia concentrations. Their contribution to nitrification may, therefore, be particularly important in sustainable systems, using organic fertilisers, and in subsoils, where ammonia concentrations will be lower. The sensitivity of crenarchaeal ammonia oxidisers to nitrification inhibitors may differ from that of bacteria. This project will test hypotheses regarding the responses of crenarchaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidisers to ammonia concentration and the consequences for their contributions to soil nitrification. The influence of ammonia concentration and inhibitors will be investigated in cells extracted from soil and, in situ, by assessment of transcriptional activity. Long-term selection will be studied in field sites fertilised with inorganic or organic N, which will also be used to determine differences in communities with soil depth. Soil microcosms will be used to determine the influence of different fertiliser strategies on ammonia oxidiser activity, the contribution of different groups and the influence of nitrification inhibitors. The hypotheses will be linked by utilisation of quantitative data from different objectives to predict community structure and nitrification rates.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>329186</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>At this moment in time, this research is largely of academic benefit.

The nitrogen cycle is an essential global biogeochemical process, and the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite is a critical step. Not only is this a required natural process, but it is also primarily responsible for the loss of nitrogen-based fertilisers. The input of man-made fertilisers into soils now exceeds that derived from natural sources, and has major consequences in terms of pollution of water courses from nitrates and the generation of the greenhouse and ozone-depleting gas nitrous oxide. There is therefore a crucial need to understand the causes and organisms responsible for this process.



Ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) have been cultivated from soil for over 120 years, and it was these organisms that were thought to be primarily responsible for ammonia oxidation in soil. However, only 6 years ago, organisms belonging to completely separate evolutionary lineage, the archaea, were also found to perform this process. Surprisingly, ammonia oxidising archaea (AOA) are numerically dominant over their bacterial counterparts and there is therefore the possibility that these organisms are actually the major players in soil ammonia oxidation. The primary aim of this research programme was therefore to determine what the relative contribution of AOA and AOB was to ammonia oxidation activity and their role in nitrogen fertiliser loss.



Using a number of different experimental approaches, this research programme successfully determined that AOA and AOB have very distinct ecological niches, and crucially, have different roles in nitrogen fertiliser transformation (Verhamme et al, 2010, ISME J). Our research determined that the crucial factor appears to be the source of ammonia that fuels the activity of both these groups. AOA are primarily dependent on ammonia derived from mineralised 'natural' organic nitrogen and to a large extent ignore applied mineral ammonia. AOB on the other hand are primarily dependent on mineral ammonia, and it is therefore they, and not AOA, who are primarily responsible for inorganic nitrogen fertiliser loss. Organic fertilisers on the other hand (such as composted organic manure) select for the growth of both AOA and AOB. However, with regard to those organisms responsible for nitrate and nitrous oxide production, it appears that it is the AOB who are the dominant players in these processes.



As very little is known about AOA, a second major scientific breakthrough was determining the source of carbon used by AOA and using this to clarify their contribution to ammonia oxidation. In a high profile paper (Zhang et al., 2010, PNAS), we demonstrated that AOA, like AOB, utilise carbon dioxide rather than organic nitrogen. Using a technique called stable-isotope probing, we were able to demonstrate the dominance of AOA activity in soils receiving no additional nitrogen input.



A further scientific objective was to determine the role of nitrification inhibitors on both AOA and AOB. Nitrification inhibitors are applied to soils in many countries to slow down the process of nitrification and therefore retain for longer periods of time ammonia-based fertilisers in soil. Our results demonstrated that while AOA and AOB to a large extent exhibit the same sensitivities to nitrification inhibitors such as DCD and nitrapyrin, other inhibitors such as allythiurea do not have the same response, with AOA appearing to be largely unaffected unlike AOB. There is therefore potential for using certain inhibitors to inhibit the activity of AOB who are responsible for nitrogen fertiliser loss and potential polluting activities, while maintaining the activities of AOA who perform 'natural' background nitrification processes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work will be of direct relevance to those concerned with inorganic nitrogen pollution (nitrate pollution from fertilizer use, eutrophication, atmospheric ammonium deposition on natural habitats, declining soil health) including regulatory and legislative organisations. The research outputs will also be valuable to scientists attempting to understanding the major contributors to nitrogen cycling processes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BEB9A720-A64C-4AE8-A1F5-7C7A0DB2501C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-616569510.3039681779eacb6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3D4146B2-5B84-49D2-AC1E-219001A6E1A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Autotrophic ammonia oxidation by soil thaumarchaea.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/515f3b02b9b8ee5fe44d8cd4e5125fb7"><gtr:id>515f3b02b9b8ee5fe44d8cd4e5125fb7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang LM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03a03a2b4b166</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6C0F5E2C-CD69-417C-9118-664FFE251A18</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ammonia concentration determines differential growth of ammonia-oxidising archaea and bacteria in soil microcosms.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The ISME journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d7d31616b0b5dc336fd1c3cb33f31ea8"><gtr:id>d7d31616b0b5dc336fd1c3cb33f31ea8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Verhamme DT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1751-7362</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d025025677f4aa</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F022646/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
