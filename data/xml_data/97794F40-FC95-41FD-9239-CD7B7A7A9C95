Once plastic waste has entered the sea, the combined action of winds and tides leads to the fragmentation of larger plastic debris into microscopic particles. These microscopic particles have become so numerous, either floating in the ocean or accumulating in sediments and on shorelines, that they are emerging as a global conservation issue of high concern. 

We have been studying what happens when microplastics are ingested by marine organisms at the lower end of the marine food web, including zooplankton that swim and feed in surface waters and marine worms that live in sediments at the ocean bottom. In our laboratory studies, ingestion of microplastics alongside food items led to reductions in body mass and reproduction. After the particles had been egested, they sank more slowly in the water column. This is important because the biomass of zooplankton and worms (so-called secondary producers) and the sinking rates of faecal pellets, are extremely important for the cycling of carbon and other nutrients in the oceans, which in turn is central to supporting all marine life. 

In this proposal, we will build on these early findings to determine their significance for ocean life. We will study in detail how much microscopic plastic is actually being ingested by zooplankton collected from sites near to shorelines in UK waters. We will take samples from across a yearly cycle to understand how the abundance of plastic debris and its ingestion by zooplankton vary with seasonal cycles. We will study the factors such as size, shape and type of plastic that influence how much microplastic is consumed and the biological effects that it may have on organisms in the aquarium. 

We will enter these results into models of ocean functions to predict what sites, if any, are most vulnerable to microplastics contamination and where the densities of microplastics may become comparable to those of invertebrate prey items. We will then use models to predict the impacts of this contamination on important ocean functions, such as the types of animals present and the cycling of both carbon and nutrients throughout the water column. 

This project will provide important scientific results to improve our understanding of key ecological functions in the oceans, illustrate how our discarded waste materials may be capable of impacting on important ocean processes, and may highlight vulnerable sites or species that require special protection. This data will be of use to environmental managers and policy makers who are required by law to keep our seas clean and reduce the risk of direct or indirect harm to human and ocean health. Ultimately the results are important to everyone in society, and may help to build up a body of evidence to encourage us not to litter in the first place.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project has been designed with direct input from stakeholders involved in marine litter from the very start and is designed to have an impact beyond its immediate academic environment. Its influence will be principally within the academic disciplines of the applicants, ecotoxicology, molecular ecology and biogeochemical modelling of ocean processes, but will extend to the environmental risk assessment and marine sciences communities and the scientists and policy professionals concerned with environmental protection.

The main group to benefit from the results of this research will be ecotoxicologists who are concerned with understanding how environmental pollutants interact with living systems, and molecular ecologists who study the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity and its relationship with physiological function. Scientists in these disciplines will benefit from the specific information relating to microscopic marine plastic debris, its bioaccumulation, interaction with body systems and potential to influence large scale ocean processes. 

In addition, human and ecological risk assessment professionals concerned with the international regulation of chemicals and substances will be interested in the results, since the safety assessment of environmental substances requires a sound weight of scientific evidence on which to base regulatory decisions. To adequately assess the risks posed by marine litter and the chemicals that may be associated with it, we need to know about their inherent properties of the chemicals and polymeric substances themselves (hazard) and to what extent organisms come into contact with them (exposure). A better appreciation of the ways in which marine litter is processed by regulatory systems in the body and the wider influence that this may have at the population level presents a subject of huge potential interest and relevance. 

This will also be of potential interest to organisations such as the Food Packaging Forum which is a charitable, non-profit organisation established to identify and communicate high quality scientific information about food contact materials, their health implications and patterns of discard and recycling, since so much of the marine litter in the environment is derived from food packaging. Individuals in the plastics industries (through organisations such as Plastics Europe) and their associated groupings, such as the Global Polymer Innovations network and related Green Chemistry initiatives are all relevant and likely to be interested, since most manufacturers are very keen to work towards reducing marine litter and would be helped with directly relevant data on what impact it may be having

Finally, those charged with implementing policies designed to protect the marine environment will be interested in the results of our research. The Marine strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) Descriptor 10: Marine Litter (see pathways to impact for more details) is implemented through the OSPAR commission (Oslo Paris Convention) and ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Seas). OSPAR's research priorities relating to marine litter are coordinated through the EU Technical Review Group on Marine Litter (part of the OSPAR Environmental Impact of Human Activities Committee, EIHA). The MSFD requires that all EU member states consider how Good Environmental Status (GES) for that descriptor will be achieved by 2020. Thus there is a huge policy driver to identify how marine litter and microplastics in particular may be impacting on marine life and how to set realistic targets to control marine litter. (see pathways to impact section for further details of our policy interactions).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Filming was undertaken on-board Plymouth Marine Laboratory's Research Vessel 'Plymouth Quest' during pelagic and benthic microplastic sampling in the coastal waters around Plymouth.</gtr:description><gtr:id>03B072A0-95BD-4B13-AC71-112C18132F3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Some of the film clips will be used by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in their promotion for a circular economy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b7ecc9895762.71679920</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Filming of microplastic sampling</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of four films and lesson plans have been developed by Digital Explorer with scientists from University of Exeter and our research group at Plymouth Marine Laboratory.

The first targeted workshop hosted by the University of Exeter's Marine Ecology and Conservation Network focused on the issue of plastic marine litter. 32 individuals were brought together from a range of sectors with specific interests in the issue. The aim was to begin to formulate achievable actions &amp;quot;Dealing with the plastic problem: Cornwall as a world-leading example.&amp;quot; 
During discussions the over-arching topics covered were: 
1. The key unknown impacts - social, economic and ecological.
2. The possible solutions - what is already happening and areas where there is a need for innovation.
3. The opportunities and barriers to facilitating desired changes.
The group agreed that there was a strong will to progress this agenda in Cornwall but that there was a clear need for wider collaboration with additional sectors including tourism, retail and industry (production and waste management), particularly the fishing industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6ee1ed32ec2.10898320-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Organising meetings and workshops, production of final report.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Participation and presentations at workshops on the problems of plastic pollution and moving towards solutions and a circular economy.

The research and discussions on plastic in the oceans created an increased interest in marine biology and the problem of plastics, and has changed behaviours towards the use of single-use plastic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b7089ecf4a27.86132040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young women in STEM careers fair (Plymouth)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7D8E21C-E7E5-4942-B7A4-0D16AD592C22</gtr:id><gtr:impact>250 people registered for the event a nearly half and half split between young people and parents/guardians.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd45c0994373.29493128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>People's Postcode Lottery</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Ellen MacArthur Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>971A1323-A5AE-4FD1-AEED-02F38C6C1806</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b6efdd252ac1.63645762</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>88500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>GW4+ Doctoral Training Partnership - PhD student Rachel Coppock</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NE/L002434/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>2420BF76-E4CA-44B9-AAAF-7B6AD3493D47</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd77fcedba71.25271152</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>88500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>EnvEast NERC Doctoral Training Partnership</gtr:department><gtr:description>EnvEast Doctoral Training Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:end>2021-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of East Anglia</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>695D63C0-8117-4061-B7FC-0E4BFC190441</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b7dd7a7ee399.01727109</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>88500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>GW4+ Doctoral Training Partnership - PhD student - Sarah Nelms</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NE/L002434/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>97C95AD8-92BE-49B5-B66E-B723E180FCF6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd779b421455.85639405</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have been used to make a TV article for BBC Inside Out Southwest demonstrating the effects of microplastic pollution on marine ecosystems. Following the broadcast our research group have been asked to give talks and provide information including to the Woman's Institute. The WI have shortlisted eight resolutions for further debate, one of which is to take action to reduce the use of plastic microbead-containing products in their own homes and communities; to raise awareness of the problems associated with plastic microbeads; and to lobby manufacturers, retailers and see the UK Government following in the steps of the Netherlands and other countries in proposing a ban on the use of these products. Following information provided by us we know of local WI groups that have voted for this resolution. The national vote takes place later this year.

Findings from our research have been used to contribute to the POSTNOTE enquiry and publication on Marine microplastic pollution. In addition our findings were presented at the House of Lords reception in June 2016 and to the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee at Westminster in July 2016 during their discussion meeting on 'What should we do about plastics?'.

Results from the modelling work have been used within an article published by the Plymouth Herald that looked at the transport of pollutants out of Plymouth Sound and toward Whitsand Bay. Based on modelling tools developed during the project, evidence was also provided to Cefas and the Marine Management Organisation regarding plans to relocate the disposal site for dredged material from the Tamar Estuary.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8746C365-4894-4D98-A54D-5EA2A612F0C7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7907bafe78.37315834</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have found more evidence of the widespread impact plastic pollution could have on the marine environment. Tiny marine creatures called zooplankton readily ingest &amp;quot;microplastics&amp;quot;, plastic debris smaller than one mm in size. This plastic is later excreted within their faecal pellets. 
In the marine environment, normal faecal pellets help transport carbon and nutrients into deeper waters, helping the ocean store carbon and providing food for animals living within the water column. 
This new study showed plankton that ate polystyrene microplastics produced faeces that were lighter than normal and therefore sank more slowly. This could have an affect on the ability of the ocean to cycle carbon and nutrients. Also, because these pellets sink slower there is a greater opportunity for them to be eaten by animals, demonstrating that microplastics can be indirectly ingested by other animals who consume these faecal pellets.
In addition as part of this grant we have developed a particle tracking model as a tool to determine the distribution, accumulation and resident time of microplastics in the marine environment. The model has provided guidance to our field sampling campaign and has been used to trace the likely path taken by microplastics released from major cities around the South West UK. We have also built a model of the impact of microplastic ingestion on zooplankton growth and reproduction. In the final stage of the project, this will be used with the marine ecosystem model ERSEM to predict the possible impact of ingestion on the dynamics of marine microbial communities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The next step is to ascertain if these findings hold true in the natural environment, and if so to what extent.
The particle tracking model can be readily used to track the fate of plastics (or pollutants in general) in other areas, both locally and around the globe.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>486E2ECD-F24F-4571-B9A2-5C76C9CDA7D3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7fa96dc370.72517670</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Provided written evidence to Environmental Audit Committee Inquiry into the Environmental impact of microplastics</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B40B0E9B-9DE6-4A20-9DE4-137DC6BA295B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b548c5b161b8.68932853</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/environmental-audit-committee/environmental-impact-of-microplastics/written/31725.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Acknowledged in UK Government POSTnote on Marine Microplastic Pollution</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6A9BCC5-72B2-4497-BB73-4144C4B74F3B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b46273eb5296.76689877</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PN-0528?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=PN528#fullreport</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consulted on UK Houses of Parliament POSTnote on Microplastics in the Marine Environment (in preparation)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93B8782C-6DDE-4F51-B010-B4AEBC424F64</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c444a4cec6c0.32840632</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consulted on UK Houses of Parliament POSTnote on Microplastics in the Marine Environment</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6355D6C-0FD9-4847-91C7-EA7DC9CD192B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d5d0c5284642.84195298</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PN-0528</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>PyLag-tools provides a set of classes and functions to help with plotting and analysing output from the particle tracking tool PyLag.
