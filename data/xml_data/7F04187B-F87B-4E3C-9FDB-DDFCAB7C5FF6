Recent research also indicates that technology can be a powerful medium to support children with autism to communicate better.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project therefore draws upon four prestigiously funded and recently completed multi-disciplinary Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) projects entitled Reactickles, Somantics, COSPATIAL and ECHOES.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim is to work closely with children and teachers in six different schools to explore how these technologies can make a measurable difference to practice in the classroom.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The methodology focuses on a participatory approach using digital story creation and the creation of a wider TEL online community of practice where teachers, parents and other schools staff will be able to create and access resources to help them in their practice.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These resources will include an online workshop, guidance documents on how to use the technologies, with suggestions of how to link with the curriculum and with assessment. The online portal will be open to all schools with the aim to inspire, motivate and engage staff in using innovative technologies to meet the needs of not only children on the autism spectrum, but all children.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our ultimate aim is to make a difference to the lives of children and young people on the autism spectrum by exploring optimum conditions for learning for them. We have seen that technology, when used in the right way, can inspire and motivate children who can be difficult to engage and that technologies can be used in new and creative ways which can be of real benefit to these children. Our key stakeholders and research beneficiaries are therefore children and young people, but also their teachers and other staff who work with them. This project will support collaboration in which academics and non- academics will have the time and scope to build connections as they work together, thereby contributing to instrumental, conceptual and capacity building impact.

* Instrumental because we want to influence practice, in particular the practice of using technology in creative and exploratory ways to encourage social communication and social skills for children and young people;
* Conceptual because we aim to explore the intersection between general and specialist pedagogies and the boundaries of technology use in real-world classrooms;
*Capacity building because through the process of the work, we will be involved in increasing children's technological skills and learning as well as developing the technical and pedagogical skills of teachers. As researchers, we will also develop our own skills and expertise in the use of technologies and in addressing how to engage in successful knowledge exchange. Crucially, such knowledge exchange will also form the basis for future research applications to further extend this important field of knowledge and application.

Our work with teachers will contribute to their professional development and we will work with them to explore new ways of using technologies. This work will include dialogue about pedagogy as well as practical work on trying new strategies in the classroom. We will encourage teachers to report on their own practice and pedagogy as well as the progress of the children, and we will ask them to share this with us through the online portal where we will give feedback. Our strategy therefore also entails working with teachers to develop their evidence-based practice.

The work will benefit the wider social science community through the evaluation of this knowledge exchange strategy itself, elements of which can be incorporated in other knowledge exchange work generally. We will evaluate the process of value creation during the project by using Wenger, Trayner and De Laat's (2011) process and framework for evaluating value creation in communities. This work will be disseminated to the social science community through conferences, workshops, publications and the TLRP TEL community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55747</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a short video clip reporting on the Festival of Social Science event held at Topcliffe Primary School in November 2012.</gtr:description><gtr:id>85A58B4F-45E6-4C90-8AB3-86AA0623AC15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The clip has had over 200 views on Youtube.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9073901305.97539c9e91c0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Festival of Social Science Video News Report- November 2012</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVpG35MzoJQ</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a short five minute video clip which explains the Shape project.

The event attracted more than 100 visitors. During this event visitors had the chance to see children from two schools (Topcliffe and Minworth) use the four technologies and to try the technologies themselves. Additionally, they were introduced to the use of digital stories, a medium of disseminating research findings. Researchers from University of Birmingham ran workshops on how to make digital stories (e.g. basic elements, resources and tools) and showed some digital story examples from the 'Shaping the future of educational technologies today: from prototypes to practice' project. The children also showed how they use Max and Ben, two knee-high humanoid robots developed by Aldebaran Robotics. These were introduced to Topcliffe School in March 2012. The event sparked a lot of discussion, questions and feedback about how to improve the technologies further. 



More than 100 people visited Topcliffe School for the event. The visitors were a mixture of practitioners, parents, students, academics and local authority representatives. Some of them were from Birmingham and the West Midlands area whilst others travelled from far away to attend the event. It received very positive evaluations. 



The event had great media coverage nationally and internationally, with live Sky News coverage on the hour every hour throughout the day, and coverage on the NBC Today programme.

The event led to further collaboration with the schools and individuals on other projects, most notably the EPSRC funded Share-It project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8613270985.5337352b42c500</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wellbeing 2013 Birmingham City University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31E96FAA-7207-4819-94D9-8EE1AF90B6F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked questions and discussion.

Abbott's e-inclusion framework (2007) sees practices as arising as an interaction between digital technologies, people and contexts. In relation to the use of Digital technologies, teachers regularly re-purposed the technologies with which they were working, and used them in different ways from those envisaged in the original TEL projects. They responded to the specific needs of the pupils using their pedagogical content knowledge by scaffolding children's engagement with the technologies in different ways. The affordances of the technologies supported collaboration which the teachers explored and extended in their sessions. The digital stories gave teachers a platform for using technology as a conduit for observing, capturing and sharing individual acheivements. In turn these stories contributed to pupil centred planning and target setting. In relation to context, pupils' motivation in and enjoyment using the technologies highlighted the need for schools to be flexible in when and how the technologies were used. Flexibility was needed due to challenges with the technologies too; buy in from management and support at school level was crucial. Furthermore, the digital stories gave practitioners agency in the way other traditional methodologies might not; there was a range of experiences and views captured, with different levels of creativity and risk-taking; there were key differences between mainstream and special schools in the extent they were willing to take risks and focus on social communication. The work enhanced practitioner's ability to interpret and make sense of what they were doing. It contributed to giving them new understandings regarding their practice and helped them see and imagine their practice differently. The outputs are listed in the annexe.

These challenges took different forms in the various schools and included difficulties with implementing some of the technologies due to firewalls and safety settings; software and hardware compatibility issues and tensions regarding availability of equipment. This finding highlights how crucial it is for TEL research to address the practical usability of technology development in the real world from the outset. 

Once these constraints were overcome, and the technologies were used in the schools, staff highlighted that they extended the way in which they used technologies to support learning. Teachers in special schools embedded the technologies in their everyday work, and found it helped them become more finely attuned to the children and more able to identify children's strengths as well as difficulties. 

Digital storytelling proved to be a powerful method for exploring and encouraging TEL yet there were varying degrees of 'readiness' for taking on the new ideas and ways of working required by the project. Most teachers were innovative, expansive and willing to take risks by trying new things, whilst others were more conservative in their approach, less directly involved and more willing to let the research team take the lead. There were differences between mainstream schools and special schools in terms of the extent to which they felt comfortable in focusing on social communication skills through technology use and also in the way that they used the technologies. 

A key finding evidenced in follow up interviews with some of the teaching staff, was how the process of capturing experiences on video enabled them to appreciate the finer detail of interaction with the technologies that would typically be missed, and that reviewing the video helped them to build on these interactions and incorporate them into future sessions. 

As evidenced by the digital stories, the technologies were used to focus on the following skills and interaction opportunities for the children:

COSPATIAL: conversation skills; flexibility; confidence; collaboration with peers; fun and skill generalisation.
ECHOES: coping with change; attention span; joint attention; motor skills; speech development and fun.
Somantics and ReacTickles: conversation skills; social interaction/ e- inclusion; emotional regulation; joint attention; initiations of communication; motor skills; attention span/ engagement level; flexibility; academic; fun/shared enjoyment/ reward; self-awareness and creativity.

The Shape project provided a platform for reflection related to embedding TEL in classrooms. It provided both teachers and researchers with an environment in which knowledge could be exchanged in a collaboratively generative manner (through digital stories), as opposed to a reactive one. The project thus provided a context for quite different Knowledge Exchange (KE) than is often observed in TEL projects where the main concern is often to develop technologies from scratch and to evaluate them within quite limited timeframes. Shape focused on a stage that is fundamental to releasing TEL from the labs and into the real world, i.e. a stage at which the technology is trialled in specific contexts and with minimal involvement by researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project continued the work of a suite of research council funded projects which include ECHOES 1 and II (EPSRC/ESRC TLRP programme; Shape (ESRC Knowledge Exchange) and Share-It (EPSRC In the Wild).

Knowledge and outcomes were developed with practitioners often (although not always) taking the lead in this respect and so this project has been about knowledge co-creation. Our dissemination of the methodology of the project and the concept of co-creation has the potential to contribute in an important way to very timely debates about evidence-based practices in the teaching profession. Specifically, by working collaboratively in knowledge co-creation, we think there could be stronger possibilities for research to have a real impact on practice. The Shape digital videos have been used as case studies to articulate the experience of children and young people with autism using technologies in meaningful and imaginative ways. By showing the technologies in learning contexts, the digital stories have enabled teachers reviewing the videos to envision possibilities for many other children. The research has reached new audiences, for example being used in adult education in one of the most economically deprived areas of the South Wales Valleys, with approximately 50 adults with profound and multiple learning difficulties accessing the technologies and using digital storytelling to gather data and review progress. The Festival of Social Sciences event in 2012 reflects the impact that Shape had on teachers and their subsequent enthusiasm for continuing the involvement in developing the technology further and in finding the best methods of embedding them in their everyday practice.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E5E07285-50B5-42B7-93B8-34536640D3F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many other researchers have expressed interest in this way of working.
