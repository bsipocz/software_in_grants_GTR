Where are those 'critical points' in a text where the translator or interpreter's decision may make a real difference to the interpretation and reception by the target audience? What are the factors that affect these decisions? This project sets out to investigating this by going beyond general questions of 'power' and 'ideology' that have occupied translation theorists for the past decade and where the exact the signs of the translator or interpreter's subjectivity are sometimes tenuously identified. This project will instead investigate in detail the ways in which meaning is dynamically negotiated and communicated between writer, translator and reader. It employs new tools of linguistic analysis from applied linguistics (notably evaluation and appraisal theory) that offer the possibility of a more systematic, comprehensive and replicable analysis of the various linguistic expressions of this negotiation. The focus of this project is therefore on identifying and modelling the process of how translators evaluate arguments in a text, on the linguistic signals that indicate this evaluation and on the potentially subjective value systems that are in operation. As well as giving greater insights into the translation process, the findings will have important applications for translator training and for professional translators working with sensitive texts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The first beneficiaries will be the academic beneficiaries: those working in text analysis applied to translation, and those working in descriptive translation studies, in cognitive studies and in translator and interpreter training (see Academic Beneficiaries). The importance of this last group is that the applications of the research for training will mean it will also directly influence the trainees, that is, students on the very many MA (and undergraduate) programmes in translation and interpreting. Since the results will be relevant across text type, genre and language, the potential number of such beneficiaries is very large - thousands of trainees per year across the world, who will then enter the translating and interpreting professions with enhanced awareness of a crucial aspect of the intercultural communication in which they are involved. Furthermore, the research will also be useable on continuing professional development and other courses run for professional translators and interpreters by organizations such as the Chartered Institute of Linguists and the Institute of Translating and Interpreting in the UK. Also, since it will be available in book form, it will also be accessible to professionals and others for self study and for others working in intercultural fields (project managers, managers of translation and interpreting services in large organisations, etc.) interested in learning more about the practical impact of translating and interpreting.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57255</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Accessible summary of findings in The Linguist</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>845BC363-6567-4E16-8AA1-A3A349A37C3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article received several comments and discussion from readers.

In particular, to investigate where translators or interpreters most 'intervene' and bring their subjectivity, and possibly their latent ideology, to the task. The study was based on both a series of experiments and on research into sources left by translators: draft manuscripts which show the revisions made at different stages in producing a text; comments and queries on online translation forums; multiple translations and interpretings of the same text, where the different choices made by the different translators might indicate different value judgements. The scenarios which were investigated were political speeches (an in-depth study of multiple simultaneous interpretings of President Obama's inaugural address), technical translation (interviews with professional translators and an examination of queries and responses on online translation forums), literary translator drafts and correspondence (using rich but under-used material at Princeton University and the Harry Ransom Center, Austin, Texas) and multiple translations of literary and technical extracts produced by MA trainee translators at Leeds. A model of analysis was borrowed from systemic functional linguistics, specifically appraisal theory, which links specific word choices to the values expressed by the writer or, in our case, translator.



Key findings were that the critical points of translation often concerned technical terminology (even in literary texts) but that they depended on the text-type: for example, professional translators noted that in marketing material they often had more problems with the different conventions of directness between the two languages and cultures. Two important findings related to all text types: (1) Word class seemed to play a role. Concrete nouns (e.g. table, man) were generally less prone to variation, while there was greatest variation in potentially ambiguous adjectival forms where the translator needs to decide whether the text is descriptive (e.g. decreasing) or evaluative (e.g. decrepit). (2) Although the presence of evaluation did not vary greatly between source texts and their translations, there was a notable change in the intensity of evaluation in all text types - intensifying adverbs such as extremely, well, scarcely etc. tended to be omitted or downplayed in translation (and particularly interpreting), as did what are known as 'non-core' words (e.g. wield might be translated as used, or harnessed as made use of). The latter has led to the recommendation of a category of 'indirect associative' evaluation which is a refinement for the model of appraisal theory when applied to translation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the research are interesting for the advances they provide for translation theory but they also have practical applications, helped by their wide dissemination in book form by a major publisher (Routledge, Summer 2012). In particular, they will be useful in informing the training of translators and interpreters and in continuing professional development for more experienced professionals. The latter was assisted by a summary article published in the The Linguist, which is sent to all members of the Chartered Institute of Linguists and is freely available online. The findings might also be useful for other professionals, such as lawyers, politicians and authors of publicity material, for understanding the processes by which values and messages are communicated in translation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6264A23C-9E38-4187-B398-83371F707D89</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2162479965.167567377603332</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>80347F78-42D8-4246-BCDE-50F4821AAA2E</gtr:id><gtr:title>New directions in discourse analysis for translation: a study of decision-making in crowdsourced subtitles of Obama's 2012 State of the Union speech</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Language and Intercultural Communication</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3c58d4b44f290e7f82ad655faa1cc09c"><gtr:id>3c58d4b44f290e7f82ad655faa1cc09c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Munday J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03e03e37677bb</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6A381D78-908B-4B8D-8DC9-221BE4E35A9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The expression of attitude in translation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses, Special issue on 'Evaluative Uses of Language: The Appraisal Framework'</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3c58d4b44f290e7f82ad655faa1cc09c"><gtr:id>3c58d4b44f290e7f82ad655faa1cc09c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Munday J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545cac4b1a5dd5.06034553</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>588F769E-1A6C-446B-8358-2D9B74E3A31E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluation in Translation: Critical Points in Translator Decision-making</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4bc620778ef850c5db7895298330d33"><gtr:id>b4bc620778ef850c5db7895298330d33</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Munday, Jeremy</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-57769-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_55516449783bf85f30</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H036733/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BC807E7B-C08E-46F6-9E44-E65554CFBA4B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E66DC80-F20F-4AC2-915A-AF46F5C6ED14</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interpreting &amp; Translation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
