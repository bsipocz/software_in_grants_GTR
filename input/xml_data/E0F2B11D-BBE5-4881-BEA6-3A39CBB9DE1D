The plastid has its own genome, separate from that of the nucleus and the mitochondrion. Many biosynthetic pathways are controlled by proteins located in the plasmid organelle and since the proteins are from a bacterial origin are not homologous to the proteins of higher organisms and so are potential drug targets. The particular pathway we are studying is the formation of iron-sulphur clusters which are essential to the function of many proteins. This involves a study of the Suf proteins. We use a variety of biophysical methods to investigate the proteins themselves and how they interact with each other.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>ATPases and GTPases are involved in a wide variety of biological processes. We have previously studied the Ras family of proteins which are involved in cell signalling and dynamin which is involved in endocytosis. We are currently focusing on the proteins expressed by the suf operon. They are believed to be involved in iron-sulphur cluster assembly. In the malaria parasite, they are found in the plastid organelle which is vital for the parasites survival. This means that there are prokaryotic biosynthetic pathways occurring in the eukaryotic parasite and are possible targets for drugs. We use a wide variety of biophysical techniques to study the proteins. For hydrodynamic studies we mainly use either sedimentation velocity or equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation methods but also light scattering and size exclusion chromatography. We study the kinetics of their mechanism by transient kinetic methods including stopped flow and quenched flow methods. These allow the direct observation of the interaction of proteins with each other or of the formation and decay of intermediates in an enzymic mechanism. To make these studies we use a fluorescent analogue of ATP, mantATP in which the ribose moiety of ATP is modified with the N-methylanthraniloyl group.||We have shown that SufC is a slow ATPase. Initially, it binds ATP weakly; this is followed by a conformational change and the cleavage of protein-bound ATP to ADP and Pi. occurs. We have shown that SufB interacts with SufC and promotes the cleavage step and stabilises the ADP bound state. SufB and SufC form a heterotrimer containing two molecules of each protein. SufD also bind to SufC but we have so far been unable to detect any effect on its ATPase. SufC and SufD form a heterodimer.|The eventual aim is to study the interactions of all of the Suf proteins in order why ATP hydrolysis is involved in iron-sulphur cluster assembly in the malarial parasite.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1995-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>880539</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U117527308</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
