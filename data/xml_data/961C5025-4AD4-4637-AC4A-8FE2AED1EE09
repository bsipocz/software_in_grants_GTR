The UK, particularly London and other large cities, has some of the highest rates of TB in Europe. Single, multi-and extensively drug resistant infection is increasing but few new drugs are in development. New treatment approaches are required. TB is a disease of poverty and patients often have other coexisting infections. Much is known about TB in HIV but little about the effect of concurrent worm infection on disease. However, worldwide such worm infections are very common and have been present for centuries before the arrival of HIV. Our preliminary data suggests that it may make TB infection more serious.

This project will investigate, in patients and in cell models, the consequence of worm infection on concurrent TB infection. In particular, the macrophage, a cell that is key in defending humans from TB, will be investigated. How worm infection alters macrophage function will be determined as this may be critical in driving inflammation and tissue destruction and hence clinical symptoms in TB patients. Much of the clinical disease due to TB is caused not by TB itself but by the human immune response to TB which leads to tissue damage and clinical illness. In this project, the regulation of macrophage production of substances called MMPs which can destroy tissue will be examined in detail. The overall aim is to understand the immunological mechanisms that lead to TB disease in the presence of worm infection with a view to opening up new approaches to therapy for use in diverse patients with TB disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Tuberculosis is more prevalent in areas with high rates of helminth coinfection. Helminths may alter macrophage phenotype influencing innate immune responses. Preliminary data gained during my Walport Fellowship in Peru shows that helminth infection alters pro-inflammatory phenotype, including gene expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). There is limited understanding of the impact of worm infection on TB-specific innate immune responses, particularly in terms of secretion of MMPs by differently polarised macrophages. Elucidating mechanisms behind differently activated macrophages has implications for our understanding of tissue destruction in TB. 

On the basis of my own and other preliminary data, I shall investigate the hypothesis that helminth infection drives macrophage-dependent immunopathology in human TB. Specific aims are to investigate effect of helminth infection on M1 and M2 macrophage activity in patients with TB. Secondly, I shall dissect mechanisms regulating such M1/M2 macrophage responses.

I shall recruit patient/control subjects with/without tuberculosis +/- helminth infection in Lima and the Amazon jungle in Peru. In addition to collecting demographic/clinical data, I shall purify PBMCs, generate M1 and M2 macrophages and stimulate them with PPD from TB or the helminth-antigen chitin. Pro-inflammatory &amp;amp; MMP activity will be analysed at the level of gene expression by qPCR, secretion by luminex and surface expression by FACs. A longitudinal assessment shall also be performed to investigate changes in immune responses when helminths +/- TB disease are treated.

Concurrently, I shall investigate regulatory pathways in differentiated M1/M2 human macrophages using techniques including phosphoprotein multiplex array, specific chemical inhibition of paths including PI3K and AMPK and specific siRNA inhibition. Understanding the mechanisms of parasite-TB interactions may identify potential targets to decrease inflammation in TB</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>My involvement in this project will aid my development as an academic clinician. I will become proficient in numerous laboratory and logistical research related skills. In addition the experience of training and managing a research team in a resource poor setting will help foster capacity building. For example whilst gathering my preliminary data in Peru I trained local research scientists in whole blood processing and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) extraction. The two way process of learning and teaching will not only benefit myself but also my future junior colleagues. 

Improved understanding of the immunopathological mechanisms relating to macrophage mediated tissue destruction in TB has the potential to unlock novel therapeutic targets. Therapies that attenuate tissue destruction in TB could have a positive impact on both TB related morbidity and mortality. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved the pathogenesis of tissue destruction in wide variety of systemic conditions including pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Understanding of the biology of MMPs may therefore be of interest to researchers in a wide variety of specialties. Furthermore clarifying the association between helminth infections and TB may have implications for mass screening &amp;amp; treatment of helminth infections that are commonly asymptomatic. 

TB is global public health priority as demonstrated by its inclusion within the millennium development goals. Additionally helminth infection is regarded by the World Health Organisation as a neglected tropical disease and as such any link connecting helminth infection to TB would be of great interest within the field of global development. Given the emergence of drug resistant TB the demand for new therapies is likely to increase and the pharmaceutical industry may be interested to take advantage of any novel therapeutic targets. The potential social and economic benefits of improved TB treatment would be felt not just in the UK, but worldwide where deaths approach 2 million per year.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>273525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N001192/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
