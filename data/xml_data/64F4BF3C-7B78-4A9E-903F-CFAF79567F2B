The tradition began in France in the middle of the twelfth century, with verse romances based on works of classical literature (the 'romances of antiquity'); before long, stories from Celtic sources were also being rewritten by Old French poets, the most famous of these being legends associated with Tristan and King Arthur. The most celebrated of these poets is Chr&amp;eacute;tien de Troyes, who wrote five extended narratives in the 1170s and 1180s, and has come to be regarded as the father of Old French romance. Over the last fifteen years, a colleague and I have been challenging this view: we believe that the ground-rules for romance were developed not by Chr&amp;eacute;tien de Troyes, but by the anonymous author of a poem known as 'Partonopeus de Blois'. The story of a young man who becomes the secret lover of a mysterious woman (who is actually the empress of Byzantium), is estranged from her, but eventually wins her back by defeating all his rivals in a three-day tournament, this skilfully-written romance combines elements of ancient history with Celtic tales and topical allusions to people and places in the real world. We have published a body of evidence suggesting that 'Partonopeus' first appeared around 1170 (not in the 1180s, as previous scholars had argued), and that it had a profound influence on Chr&amp;eacute;tien de Troyes and the other twelfth-century writers who set narrative fiction on the course that eventually brings us the novel. \n\n'Partonopeus de Blois' exists in a number of different versions: there are two separate accounts of what happens to the hero's greatest rival, and some manuscripts contain a sequel (the Continuation), while others end with the marriage of Partonopeus and his beloved Melior. In 2005, my research team published an electronic edit of 'Partonopeus' that brings together the full text of all the different versions, to allow specialists to study their inter-relationships and try to work out what the 'first edition'' of this important poem was like. My proposed research involves completing a book about 'Partonopeus' that brings together the results of years of detailed study of its structure, sources and handling of literary themes, and combines these with insights made possible by using the electronic edition. This book will propose the first complete account of how the different 'editions' of the poem were created (there were at least five, spanning the late twelfth and the early thirteenth centuries). It will also show that 'Partonopeus' is even more closely linked to the politics of its time than has previously been thought, providing new evidence to suggest that this apparently simple love-story includes references to the great news stories of its day, including the murder of Thomas Becket and military expeditions in the Middle East. The book contains the first in-depth study of the Continuation, which will explore how and why a follow-up to the first story was composed: I suggest that 'Partonopeus' was hugely influential in establishing the idea that romance is an open-ended form, whose story-lines can be taken up and developed in new directions after they have gone into circulation, in much the same way that modern films can generate sequels, prequels and reworkings of 'completed' narratives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>At the time of application, it is difficult to identify direct, immediate impacts of this research for beneficiaries other than academics or students in the humanities, since the principal outputs (a specialist monograph and a conference paper) are clearly designed to meet the needs of these constituencies. Postgraduate students at Sheffield (PhD and taught Masters) have already benefited in a number of ways: I have shared new insights from intensive study of 'Partonopeus de Blois' with research students currently working on this text and others that are related to it; I have also revised elements of a module on medieval intertextuality as my understanding of the techniques of rewriting has developed. This kind of direct positive influence on the student experience is likely to continue for the lifetime of this project, but longer-term, indirect impacts beyond academia can also be envisaged.\n\nSuccessful completion of this research will enable me to carry forward knowledge and experience into my next project, namely the preparation of the first modern English translation of this text. This translation will be designed to appeal to both academic readers and the wider public (Penguin Classics are a possible publisher). Because of the language barrier, the general reader in the English-speaking world currently has very limited access to medieval French romances, despite the fundamental role that they played in shaping a key genre of Western literature and in setting the terms of subsequent debate about concepts such as romantic love, the quest for identity and the relation ship between the individual and society. The number of accurate, well-contextualised translations in non-specialist imprints is growing, but the sheer variety and vitality of twelfth-century fiction still remains largely hidden from those outside academia.\n\nYet there is widespread public interest in the material culture of the Middle Ages (witness the popularity of living history) and a healthy appetite for modern fiction with a medieval setting. One of my research team on the 'Partonopeus de Blois' electronic edition project has just published the first of a planned series of medieval detective novels, drawing on the specialist knowledge she acquired as an AHRC-funded Research Associate.* Improving access to medieval fiction itself is a logical next step. Romances such as 'Partonopeus' form the basis for what I call 'emotional archaeology' (the title of my inaugural lecture, now available as a podcast on HumBox). While material artefacts can tell us much about the culture of the past, only the stories that people told one another allow us to drill down to their hopes and fears, their desires and preconceptions, their sense of humour, and the many other aspects of being human that leave little or no trace in the archaeological record. Bringing those stories to a wider modern public can only enhance understanding of the sophistication of medieval European literature and thought, and of the cultural constants that link us to this part of our heritage.\n\n*Catherine Hanley, 'The Sins of the Father: A Mediaeval Mystery' (Quaestor2000 Publishing, 2009); the sequel, 'The Bloody City', will appear in 2010.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H037950/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
