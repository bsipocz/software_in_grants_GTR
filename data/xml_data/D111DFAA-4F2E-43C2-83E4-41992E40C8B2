This project considers the extent to which, and the leading dimensions along which, the returnee can impact positively on the source country, and in turn how the sending country can maximise its benefits from temporary migration by supporting the returnee. This dynamic relationship in turn informs the incentives of migrants to stay temporarily rather than permanently in the host country, and to become directly a driver or contributor to economic development in the source country. Hence, resulting in a win-win-win situation for migrants, sending countries and receiving countries. Our main findings are:
-There is a positive role of temporary migration on migrants: they accumulate savings which increase their probability of becoming entrepreneurs and setting up businesses. They acquire skills overseas which allow them to gain wage premiums, relative to non-migrants upon return. They also transfer ideas and norms that impact on the economic and political outcomes observed in the home country. Hence, this suggests that return migration reduces credit constraints faced in developing countries and allows for brain circulation and gains for sending economies.
- There are several challenges that are limiting our understanding of the actual impact of return migration. The biggest obstacle is the lack of data on return migration. Given the non-random nature of emigration and return, reliance on non-representative sample of returnees is problematic. Thus, there is a need to ensure that census data and representative surveys such as LSMS and LFS collect systematically information on previous location 5 years ago to capture returnees and also data on members of the household who are overseas at the time. 
-The second challenge is for policymakers. The right mix of policies is required to maximise the benefits of return migration. Facilitating investment by reducing the red tape and providing information on investment possibilities to migrants and returnees should be promoted. Given that return migrants tend to be willing and more likely to embark on setting up projects/businesses, there is a room for encouraging and directing their investment. Also, investors need reassurances about their rights and the enforcement of contracts. Moreover, there is a need to provide information on areas of investment to encourage migrants' investment. Finally, migrants can play an important role in job creation in their home countries through their investment if they are enticed using the right financial incentives such as tax holidays to set up business and create jobs.
-Overall, our project highlights that return migrants are an important potential resource for developing sending countries, such as Egypt and Morocco, that so far has not been fully utilised.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>-The biggest obstacle is the lack of data on return migration.

A refresher sample (financed by our ESRC/DFID research project) was added to the 2012 wave to allow a more detailed measure of migration trends, determinants, consequences and return migration in Egypt. A new refresher sample of 2,000 households over-sampling areas with a high density of migrants was added. In addition, two new modules (one on return migration and the other on current migration) were designed by J. Wahba and added to the ELMPS2012. 

The 2012 round of the survey provides a unique opportunity to ascertain the impact of the momentous events accompanying the January 25th revolution on the Egyptian economy and labor market and on the lives of Egyptian workers and their families. The Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey of 2012 (ELMPS 2012) is the third round of this longitudinal survey, which was also carried out in 2006.

The ELMPS is a wide-ranging, nationally representative panel survey that covers topics such as parental background, education, housing, access to services, residential mobility, migration and remittances, time use, marriage patterns and costs, fertility, women's decision making and empowerment, job dynamics, savings and borrowing behavior, the operation of household enterprises and farms, besides the usual focus on employment, unemployment and earnings in typical labor force surveys. In addition to the survey's panel design, which permits the study of various phenomena over time, the survey also contains a large number of retrospective questions about the timing of major life events such as education, residential mobility, jobs, marriage and fertility. The survey provides detailed information about place of birth and subsequent residence, as well information about schools and colleges attended at various stages of an individual's trajectory, which permit the individual records to be linked to information from other data sources about the geographic context in which the individual lived and the educational institutions s/he attended.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7472821D-04AE-4185-BB91-C7F1682B3D35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Citations of Publications that used the study:
