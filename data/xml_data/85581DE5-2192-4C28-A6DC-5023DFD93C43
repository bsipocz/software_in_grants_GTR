For the last three years, 'lad cultures' and associated reports of inappropriate sexual harassment, violence and trans/homophobia in universities, have been the focus of much debate for the UK media, educational leaders and Government policy makers. There is now a considerable body of research documenting 'lad cultures' in universities. Existing research has led to better awareness of the need in universities to have policies, training and communications campaigns to emphasise appropriate forms of masculinity and to police inappropriate behaviours where necessary. Concerns have also been raised about inappropriate behaviours from young men on SNS through 'lad culture' related hashtags, with increasing reports of misogynistic trolling against women and homo/transphobic abuse. Against the backdrop of these concerns, this research will contribute additional data from, and about, SNS sources, so as to develop a wider understanding of the role of SNS in 'lad cultures' as part of contemporary young masculinities in the UK, and help facilitate discussion and training about appropriate masculinities on SNS. 

The research adds to our understanding of 'lad cultures' by exploring how behaviours associated to 'laddism', are represented, consumed and (re)produced as part of young masculinities on the SNS platforms of Twitter and Instagram. It examines these platforms through discourse analysis of interactions in popular 'lad' related hashtags, to create a picture of how the elements of 'lad culture' which cause concern, fit with other modes of SNS expression related to 'laddism', such as 'banter', humour and sport. The research goes beyond the simplistic and often polarised descriptions of young masculinities in 'lad cultures' given in media reports, to develop a nuanced picture of the associations made to 'lad culture'. Through qualitative research (focus groups and interviews) amongst SNS users, it will seek to understand how they experience posts and images related to 'lad culture'. Many university based 'lad cultures' are made up of predominantly middle and elite class white men. However, when we trace 'lad culture' in the UK historically, to the 'new lad' made famous by Loaded magazine in the 1990s, and anxieties about 'laddism' in schools in the 1970s, 'lad culture' hailed from the working classes. The media is still replete with representations of working class 'lads' from Youtube's Dapper Laughs, giving fellow lads tips on how to 'pull', through to the continual objectification of women expressed by Gaz Beadle and Scott Timlin from MTV's Geordie Shore (2011-2016). The research therefore also considers if class differences create different or similar discourses, visual formations and experiences of 'lad cultures' on SNS. To facilitate debate about what is appropriate masculinity in the particular context of SNS, and to create meaningful and appropriate impact from those discussions, the research will be conducted in conjunction with three community based charity project partners, each with an interest in a key strand of the research in terms of their own strategy, policy and training plans: Goodlad Initiative, promoting and training around positive and appropriate masculinity; Survivors Network, helping those who have experienced sexual abuse and violence; and METRO, tackling homo/transphobia and offering support around gender and sexual identity. The charities will offer expertise, links to young people, and will work with the project to develop training around appropriate and positive masculinities for their users, staff and other community groups. The research will yield a vital data set for academics, policymakers, Government, universities and the media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project is designed to have considerable impact upon stakeholders, and those who are the subject of the research, above and beyond immediate academic beneficiaries, as follows: GoodLad Initiative (GL) will develop their strategy, policies and specific sections of their workshops that focus upon appropriate and positive masculinity in social networking sites using the new research. GL will specifically benefit from understanding young people's views on 'lad cultures' on SNS including particular scenarios experienced by all genders and sexual orientations that could be used as anonymised role plays or discussion points. Thus, users of GL will experience the impact of new insights into the way 'lad cultures' are viewed on SNS and will be able to reflect on their proximity to or distance from these situations. 

Survivors Network (SN) propose to use the research to inform their strategy and policies around experiences of 'lad cultures', harassment, bullying online, physical sexual harassment and violence to plan its approaches, information provision and appropriate training for its staff Thus, SN can understand the specific issues on SNS and consider how people from all genders take part in a 'lad culture' that can lead to sexual harassment and violence. Ultimately it will be those seeking advice from SN about online and offline harassment who will be impacted by the outcomes of the research, via the interventions of SN as an intermediary. METRO is an equalities charity promoting diversity and wellbeing through youth, mental health and wellbeing services. METRO aim to better understand issues that can affect wellbeing in relation to gender and sexual identity to inform their own strategy and provision of services in the area. METRO will benefit from understanding issues of inclusion and exclusion for LGBTQI+ people in relation to 'lad cultures'. Thus, its users will benefit and be impacted by provision of information and training about changing masculinities in the UK and how to negotiate discourses of masculinity in relation to their own gender and sexual identity. 

Beyond these immediate project partners, wider impact is envisaged, which will implicate the broadcast and print news media, SNS companies (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google, LADbible), Government policy makers, professionals working with young people, sports and community groups working with young adults through the availability of new knowledge about the nature of 'lad cultures'. The project will provide a broader and more nuanced view of how 'lad cultures' are reproduced and the types of discourses that dominate conversations, from those that have been associated with sexual harassment and homo/transphobia, to other versions of the 'lad' associated to sports, friendship and leisure. Representatives of these groups, will each be advantaged by direct dissemination of the results through the following means: 

1) All project partners will receive copies of the research and work in conjunction with the research team to produce training materials for their own use. 
2) These materials will also be more broadly disseminated through website availability, project partner and university networks, and SNS shares. 
3) Briefing papers targeting relevant Government committees, businesses, sports associations and teams, the NUS, universities and other relevant community groups will be produced. These will include visuals of 'lad culture' conversations to make the research accessible to the media and wider non-academic organisations (see 'Pathways to Impact' document). 
4) Project partners, university welfare leaders, policy makers and the media will be invited to a launch of the report at a 'Young Masculinities and Social Networking Sites' conference. 
5) The project and its results will be promoted through SNS and to the media through posts and press releases. 
6) All data will be stored by the UK Data service on behalf of the ESRC for public access.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>206324</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P010628/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
