Treatment regimens which are highly effective under controlled trial conditions have been available for many years but need to be given for at least 6 months. Many patients fail to complete treatment since they feel much better after 2-3 months treatment. Shorter and simpler regimens are urgently needed. Giving drugs in combined tablets rather than separately may also improve the chances of a successful outcome.||The CTU is currently conducting two international multi-centre trials and has recently completd a third one which assesses the effectiveness of combined tablets in the first two months of treatment when four drugs are given compared to giving the same drugs separately.||The other two studies are assessing a new drug for tuberculosis, moxifloxacin, to see whether it can enable treatment to be shortened from 6 to 4 months which would have considerable advantages both for the health services in developing countries and the patients. In one of these studies treatment after two months is given intermittently in combination with rifapentine, a long acting derivative of rifampicin, one of the standard anti-tuberculosis drugs.||In addition to the studies in drug sensitive disease the CTU is preparing to start a trial in multi-drug resistant disease using a regiemn which has been developed and implemented with considerable success in Bangladesh.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There have been no new anti-tuberculosis drugs for over 40 years; many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing increases of 4-5 times the numbers of cases of tuberculosis reported 20 years ago, largely as a consequence of the HIV-AIDS epidemic. Ther is also a growing problem with multi-drug resistant disease (MDR-TB). The CTU is currently involved in conducting two clinical trials of tuberculosis regimens, assessing new drugs. They have recently completed one comparing fixed dose combinations versus separate drugs All of the trials are multi-centre international studies with sites in the developing world.||Study C is an evaluation of a four-drug fixed dose combined tablet for the initial intensive two month phase of treatment for pulmonary TB; if treatment is given in combined tablets it is likely adherence will be better and failures due to drug resistance less likely to occur. Patients receive ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide, given as either combined tablets or separate tablets. In the continuation phase all patients will receive rifampicin and isoniazid, in a fixed dose tablet, three times a week for 4 months. The primary endpoints are 1) the combined rate of failure at the end of treatment and relapse by 30 months and 2) the occurrence of serious adverse events any time during chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints include sputum culture results at two months (after initiation of chemotherapy).|The REMox and RIFAQUIN trials are assessing the possibility of shortening chemotherapy from 6 to 4 months by substituting moxifloxacin for one of the drugs in the standard regimen. Mouse studies have suggested that substituting moxifloxacin for either ethambutol or isoniazid is likely to enhance the rate of culture conversion. Data from studies in humans have shown there is a correlation between the culture results early in treatment and the likelihood of subsequent relapse. In REMox the two experimental regimens in which moxifloxacin has been substituted are both given for 4 months and compared in a non-inferiority design to the standard 6 month regimen.|RIFAQUIN is also a non-inferiority trial which includes rifapentine as well as moxifloxacin as an experimental drug. Rifapentine is a long acting rifamycin and the two intervention regimens are one in which moxifloxacin are given once weekly in the continuation phase in a standard 6 month duration regimen and one in which the two drugs are given twice weekly in a 4 month duration regimen (2 months intensive phase and 2 months continuation phase). In both REMox and RIFAQUIN the primary endpoint is failure during treatment or subsequent relapse.|A protocol is currently being developed to assess a treatment regimen for MDR-TB; this regimen has been used with considerable success in Bangladesh and needs to be evaluated in other geographical settings.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1324000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12023/19</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
