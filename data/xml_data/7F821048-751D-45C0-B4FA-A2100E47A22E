The Grace &amp;amp; Green Story
By 2013, we'd had enough of feminine hygiene products that were suspected of causing more harm than good to our environment. Our search for a solution to find something that was effective, natural, sustainable, yet still convenient and accessible for women, proved fruitless. Unable to find a product on the market that met our standards, we set about investigating the topic: firstly, surveying large numbers of young girls and women (to see what was important to them in sanitary products); investigating and researching into various environmental materials that are best at being an effective adsorbent; applying green and ethical independent thinking and innovation into everything we do, from the packaging, to where we source and manufacture our products. This has led us to create ?Grace &amp;amp; Green?. 

The name says it all. ?Grace? stands for respect, good will, bringing honour and credit - a harmonious integration of your body, mind and spirit with the way of nature. ?Green? is not just a colour. Since the beginning of time it has signified growth, rebirth, and fertility, and today it more popularly known as a symbol of ecology, the environment, and universally associated with nature.
The simplest most elegant definition that we think best fits what we do being: creating with compassion for people and planet.

We don't just stop there. We respect our customers as smart, sustainability-minded, health-conscious individuals. We respect our environment, by offering biodegradable, recyclable and refillable packaging to lessen the burden of waste. And we respect people, by seeking Fair Trade ingredients and employment practices, producing the finest natural products we can, as ethically as we can. 

Feminine hygiene protection. Your way.
Whether women prefer a digital or applicator tampons, pads or panty liners, we have the feminine hygiene protection young girls and women want and need all made with the high quality, natural ingredients they deserve. We want to develop our products using the finest raw ingredients on the planet. Naturally made, chemical and fragrant-free, providing amazing effective results.

We will closely monitor every stage of the process, from growing to gathering, producing, packaging and distribution - using the lowest amounts of water and minimal carbon footprint. As you hold our products in your hand, you will get the vibe that we care. You will notice that the packaging whilst being biodegradable and recyclable, is unapologetic for being great in design and look. We will offer a long-term travel product dispenser (also made out of bamboo) which are not only refillable, hand-bag friendly, they are also chic and beautiful in look and design. Both are an industry first. 

What Motivates Us? No more business as usual.
Grace &amp;amp; Green is dedicated to discovering the latest research related to the issues that move us, exposing the truth and reality of menstruation around the world, and spreading awareness and educating all who express an interest. 

We want to restore consumer faith that you can have safe, reliable feminine hygiene products that are healthy for you and healthy for the planet. As far as we see it, it has got to be win-win for both us and the planet or we're just not interested.

Clearly, responsible corporate behavior could solve most of today's social and environmental problems. At Grace and Green, we strive to be the leader in developing a new, conscientious corporate model.

We are purpose driven.
We believe that it is possible to provide products that are safe, effective, natural, affordable and sustainable.
We believe that it is possible to make significant positive impacts [social, environmental and economic] throughout the production, packaging distribution and use of our products.

We will visibly, measurably and enthusiastically make a difference by giving where change and impact happens. We believe that it is possible to successfully achieve sustainability, by working in collaborative partnerships with organisations that help advance the issues and causes we believe in. 10% of our pretax profit will go back into supporting organisations in developing countries. 

As an ethical for-profit company, we are confident that profit is good, because of the impact it makes to help change our world.

Keeping it simple. 
We feel that getting past confusing terminology and hype allows us to focus on what really matters, and that has let us bring together the whole package: sustainable feminine care for active, health and environmentally conscious women and young girls.

If you are into fresh, local and organic; 
and if you care about what you and your loved ones put in your bodies; 
and how the production of those products impact this amazing planet;
and you?re interested in how menstruation affects other women and young girls around the world; 
and if you want a product that works;

doesn't harm the Earth; 
and even has a positive social impact.
