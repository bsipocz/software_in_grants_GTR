participatory engagement and policy development</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/L000709/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The purpose of this fellowship is to establish and develop best practice for knowledge exchange across interdisciplinary projects in different hazard environments and contexts. My goal is to work with researchers and project partners to promote information-sharing between disciplines, and to build relationships that enhance international cooperation in the event of a disaster. This will be achieved through facilitating data sharing and data management best practice, attending meetings, and working closely with project researchers and partners. I will also work across IRNH projects to engage with the research teams and work with the consortia to identify key end users of the research findings, and to process outputs into usable formats for these groups. To promote best practice in knowledge exchange across disciplines, I propose to work with the other KE fellow to establish an interdisciplinary network and a workshop for interdisciplinary practice. This network and workshop will bring together researchers, practitioners, policy makers, students and others to share knowledge of the interdisciplinary process, and to facilitate the development of best practice. This knowledge exchange will inform the research process of the IRNH projects.

Both IRNH projects will focus on working with identified communities at risk, either from earthquake or volcanic hazards. In order to translate knowledge and to influence policy and practice beyond the boundaries of research, and to achieve measurable project impact, a variety of end users will need to be identified and engaged in the research process. These will include: community members, practitioners, researchers and policy makers. To facilitate the flow of communication and information between researchers and stakeholders, particular emphasis will be placed on two areas in order to increase project impact: to promote and evaluate the uptake of knowledge in local communities at risk, and to disseminate knowledge across a wide network of end users by developing policies from a sound evidence base.

At a local level I will work between researchers and local communities to engage with stakeholders and to develop trust through establishing long-term relationships. To achieve maximum impact at a local level, I propose to work alongside the STREVA project and focus on working with local partners and stakeholders in the trial volcano locations (St Vincent, Colombia and Ecuador). Local engagement and shared generation of knowledge will be achieved by working in a participatory way with local communities and partners, and methods would be transferable to any hazard location. I will work in collaboration with social scientists, and interview and focus group methods will be used to engage with stakeholders at two stages in the project. Initially, in order to identify stakeholder needs and capacities, and to identify any barriers to increasing resilience locally. This would be used to inform the STREVA project researchers of where their work will have the most impact. At a later stage, preliminary research outputs will be fed back to local stakeholders, to discuss and refine findings with them. This will start the process of embedding research outputs into practice. After an agreed period of time I will return to the workshop locations to assess project impact at a local level, using agreed measures of success that will be dependent on the project outputs. 

At the policy level I will collaborate with the other KE fellow, the Impact Advisory Group, the PURE Programme Network and policy makers both in the UK and globally, in order to develop policies and frameworks that are grounded in the research findings. The collaboration will facilitate the translation of research results into accessible policy guidelines. Liaison and attending conferences of global initiatives such as the UNISDR will further disseminate the findings of the research and communicate these at the policy level.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>247857</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Unidad Nacional para la Gesti?n del Riesgo de Desastres (UNGRD)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Colombia, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Unidad Nacional para Gestion de Riesgo (UNGRD)</gtr:description><gtr:id>EECE7C38-A374-4F52-8DDF-4C62E08D0E25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>STREVA Colombia workshop in October 2014</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544648a93a6389.06499825-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In February and August visits UNGRD provided links with the Red Cross that facilitated our meeting with them, they gave presentations about their work, and an MOU is now under-review between UNGRD and the British Geological Survey (BGS) to facilitate collaboration.

Further, they attended the rest of the workshop and brought students who acted as note-takers during the focus group sessions in Armero-Guayabal. They will send us the notes.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>To design the KE technical discussion activity in Social Science methods I talked extensively with SGC about what they wanted from this event, and where to start the learning from. We decided to start at the beginning, with a basic introduction to social science methods. Having met with a contact at UNGRD with links to the University of Manizales, and obtaining further contacts in the social science department there from UNGRD, (who have recently signed an MOU with University of Manizales) I coordinated contact between a STREVA researcher (Teresa Armijos) and the University of Manizales. As a result of this, instead of Teresa and I designing social science methods workshop materials (which we did anyway as a back-up), the University offered to host the 2 days of pre-workshop KE technical discussions free of charge, and made a proposal to deliver the social science methods workshop themselves. This is exactly what we wanted: to build relationships between local institutes so that SGC could seek social science support from a local university, without creating dependence on an overseas project (STREVA). This is a longer-term capacity-building strategy. There are ongoing plans within STREVA to continue to work with the University of Manizales in data-gathering for research into social vulnerability in upcoming research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Colombian Red Cross</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Colombia, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Red Cross, Colombia</gtr:description><gtr:id>003C1407-5CA5-4595-94CF-510A35F21C00</gtr:id><gtr:impact>STREVA workshop in Colombia 2014</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544652f1f3f9e6.32640743-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Caldas branch of the Red Cross provided a vnue for 2 days of the workhop in Armero Guayabal and some members of the Red Cross accompanied us to Cerro Machin to share their experiences from the 'forensic' volcano (eruptions at Nevado del Ruiz) with those in the 'trial' volcano (Cerro Machin, not erupted for many years).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We ran the STREVA workshop in Colombia, bringing the regions of Caldas and Tolima together, with emergency managers, local Red Cross, local communities and national government bodes UNGRD and SGC.

This will bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss inter- and transdisciplinary best practice. 

A key aim of this workshop is to foster a supportive community of researchers and practitioners working in inter- and transdisciplinary practice, by drawing from our collective experiences and working towards shared understandings of good practice. A proposed output of the workshop is a working document that reflects some key ingredients for success, and key challenges to be mindful of, building from the experiences, perspectives and reflections of those attending the workshop. The workshop will be participatory and attendees are invited to share their thoughts on how we may foster an active and engaged community of researchers and practitioners working in this space. 

A starting point for discussions will be to work from data gathered with the Strengthening Resilience in Volcanic Areas Project during my current fellowship. Seeking further input and strengthening the evidence.

This is intended to form a staring point to set up a working group in international best practice on this topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc209db11db8.66769891</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Teaching undergraduates at Kingston University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE5FB56F-E881-4A55-AF4D-A97A65017A3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lectures in 'applied Disaster Risk Reduction' at Kingston University, drawing on knowledge from my research in volcanic and small island contexts, as well as earthquake and tsunami case studies</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc1ee37b2926.91312522</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IRNH KE workshop series</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D89AD3F0-8CDC-4709-940E-A66144BF12AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Myself and Susanne Sargeant ran the first in the series of KE Increasing Resilience to Natural Hazards (IRNH) workshops on 9 July 2014 at UCL on the topic 'engaging communities and decision makers without recent hazards experience'. There were 17 participants in total, including Susanne and myself and UCL note-takers. Last-minute changes sickness/schedule conflicts) meant that a couple of participants could not attend, but there were 5 EwF researchers and 8 STREVA researchers present, as well as Peter Sammonds, and an invited speaker from Kings College London. The format was participatory, with some introductory updates from each project PI, and update of KE progress and activities then moving into participation and discussions. Feedback forms captured some learning and very positive feedback, with all participants that completed the forms saying that they either 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' that the workshop met their expectations, and captured the elements of learning gained by the consortia from the event. The form also included as the most and least interesting parts of the day to inform our KE learning for running future events. Many participants said that they'd like to attend future events. Overall the event was a huge success, and we received a lot of positive feedback verbally as well as that captured on the feedback forms.

The second IRNH workshop ran on 27 February 2015, and was held at ODI in London. The workshop involved 18 participants, 6 from EwF, 6 from STREVA, 2 KE fellows, IRNH strategic advisor Peter Sammonds, Chris Noyce (ESRC) and two invited speakers: Matt Foote from MSLIM (insurance sector) and Joel Gill from Kings College London. We additionally had 1 student note-taker from KCL. The topic for this was &amp;quot;Challenging the risk = hazard x vulnerability paradigm and the role of secondary hazards in DRR&amp;quot;. This topic was voted on by participants from both consortia projects and was the most popular of a series of topic suggestions that were derived from the feedback forms after the first workshop in July and through dialogue with project researchers. Again the event went extremely well. It felt like a very different day to the last workshop, making the format participatory but deliberately different to keep things fresh and interesting, but it was equally rewarding. We received much positive feedback during the day, and collected feedback forms (as previously) to capture learning. Notes were taken by an external student note taker again, and this worked well. Susanne and I will write this up into a workshop report, as before. We also plan to publish a commentary piece in collaboration with the projects on this workshop topic.

This event went extremely well, and we received very positive feedback from the participants from across EwF and STREVA, both in-person and reflected in the post-event feedback forms. All of the written feedback from participants included that they either agreed or strongly agreed that the event met their expectations. In general learning points were mainly centred on the value gained from sharing experiences across the two projects.

St Vincent, education conference (held in March 2015).
Since the STREVA workshop in January I have kept in contact with a woman from the University of West Indies Open Campus. I met with her during the workshop, to discuss STREVA and opportunities to assist with impact and education. I was introduced by a Red Cross contact on the island, who I had met at the workshop. 

Following the meeting at UWI Open Campus my contact suggested that perhaps a conference held on island about disasters could be held, and that she would like to include volcanic hazards in the conference as a result of hearing about STREVA. 

I have intermittently spoken with her, supporting the idea, and providing contacts of people on the Island who she could work with (Red Cross, NEMO and UWI DRR Unit in Jamaica). These institutions were all present at the St Vincent STREVA workshop and who I had contacts for. I passed on their details. 

On 17 July my contact sent through a Call for Papers for this conference. The idea has developed into a full conference event, to be held in March in St Vincent. The conference is co-run with NEMO and the Red Cross. 

I have forwarded the flyer to STREVA and encouraged their attendance and presentations at the event to show our support. I have requested any inputs for funding ideas, as my contact asked for funding suggestions.

This has been locally owned and led, but encouraged and assisted in making connections through my KE role. A flyer for the conference is attached. Along with an email chain showing our dialogue since January 2014.

STREVA applied for additional funding to run a bolt-on workshop to discuss ashfall impacts, which has been successfully funded through NERC. The initial 'country conference' has enabled STREVA to add-on further activities in-country to bring stakeholders (including utilities companies) together to discuss how a future volcanic eruption may affect them, and how they might reduce their risk, this time in the context of ash fall hazards.

Through my attendance of Policy talks to learn more about how to engage with policy-makers, I helped Jenni Barclay (STREVA's P.I.) to write introductory letters to large policy organisations in the Caribbean region to invite them to attend and participate in the STREVA ash hazard workshop in March. Jenni said that she has received positive responses from many of those contacted.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CBCC5FBA-8053-4183-945A-DFA6828E88BA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544629054ed879.40207999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I undertook KE fieldwork for initial stakeholder engagement to broker relationships in Colombia for the STREVA project and gain an understanding of the context (actors, as well as existing risk and resilience research/projects in-country). Susanne Sargeant and I undertook this work together and we co-authored a KE report from our joint work in Colombia, shared with STREVA before we left Colombia, to deliver the findings of our meetings with stakeholders quickly to the project. We discovered that due to many complexities of working in Pasto, the Observatory partner would prefer that we worked elsewhere in Colombia. We were further informed by many differing perspectives gained from a variety of stakeholders during our fieldwork. 
I have continued to be involved in Colombia work. I took part in another Colombia pre-workshop trip in August 2014 with Sue Loughlin from BGS (STREVA WP5) and Jeremy Philips from Bristol University to build on these initial relationships, and to develop further relationships to facilitate and inform the research process in Colombia, building up to a large workshop to launch the STREVA project research in Colombia in October 2014. This stage involved co-design of the upcoming workshop, building from the first understandings developed in February. Following this trip, in the UK I liaised with STREVA researchers about what worked well in past workshops, to inform the design and to meet the research needs when designing workshop activities. In October we ran a sucessful workshop in Colombia, involving many different stakeholder groups, different communities affected by Nevado del Ruiz volcano and shared learning between this, and the 'trial' volcano setting Cerro Machin by including a community leader from Cerro Machin in the workshop and then travelling to Cerro Machin with people from Armero-Guayabal area who had experienced the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in 1985. Each activity was designed to facilitate mixing between disciplines and institutes, and each was co-designed in collaboration STREVA-SGC (Observatory). We held pre-workshop KE technical discussions in social sciences, lahar modelling and hazard mapping following the findings of earlier trips where we found that capacity-building in these areas was desired by our partners, so we built these-in. Workshop activities included: fieldtrips (Nevado del Ruiz and Cerro Machin), introductory talks and volcano observatory tour, focus group discussions (recovery and learning from past eruptions at Nevado del Ruiz), feedback and reflection sessions, and final learning summary/where-to-from-here discussion.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The KE report from the first trip in February informed the selection of the forensic volcano (originally chosen to be Galeras), but which was then changed to Nevado del Ruiz as a result of the in-country findings. This initial engagement, and reporting, received very positive feedback from STREVA, with the PI describing this work as ?shining a light on Colombia? for them. 
All of this work led to a successful co-designed workshop in Colombia in October 2014, at the same time building in-country inter-institutional relationships, building capacity and developing shared understanding and learning from the past for a more resilient future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B875B663-49E4-4D43-8020-ECBF58E9FD90</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544627e036c259.79970434</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited contribution to HFA2</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38CC9FDF-D9CF-453F-B0F8-83323001D4DF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544660b9a22e82.33495303</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This methodology will develop to inform resilience-building approaches, and learning how to affect, and assess, change at a local level.

I have developed a 'baseline' of information gathered in St Vincent, to serve as a starting point for future evaluation and learning about the observable (and many won't be observable) ways in which the project has generated impact at a local level. To gather this information I took part in the STREVA workshop in St Vincent and stayed in St Vincent after the workshop in order to meet with stakeholders, working closely with the Governance work package to hold meetings and some informal interviews. We met with 9 stakeholders during this time, mainly from Ministries within Government for land use planning, transport, education... as well as the Red Cross. This provided much information about the context in St Vincent now. I have subdivided the information into the work packages of STREVA, as a way of trying to distil and make sense of the varied baseline information, and to aid change as I track forwards. 
I also have baseline information for Colombia from fieldwork in February-March, August and the STREVA workshop in October, and process into the same format as St Vincent. 
I plan to return yearly to case study areas to try to see what I can to trace change, mainly by undertaking interviews with risk management stakeholders and partners (organisational and institutional level within each region only, I don't have time or resource to look at individual/community level in each case study area) to gather 'stories of change'. This will identify attributions of change, descriptions of impact (or not) an underlying reasons for any changes. This informs any study aiming to build resilience and achieve impact at a local level, beyond only attaining 'impact' within academia (i.e. peer-reviewed publications).</gtr:description><gtr:id>A6598E39-D110-4B49-9930-41B0AF2CE0C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In development, will evolve over the fellowship</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544663be54daa4.44648875</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Documenting impact on-the-ground in STREVA case study areas</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Understanding how a consortia project learns to work in an interdisciplinary way, as the project learns, modifies in approach, as the researchers learn together and work in an interdisciplinary way, and how the project integrates stakeholders needs and wishes. This documents the 'learning journey' of a complex project, serving to inform future collaborations in how to work more effectively. I use a mix of approaches including: developing Theories of Change with Researchers for each of the case study areas (can be repeated over time to document change in thinking and strategy); surveying researchers and partners about their wants/needs of the project and the research goals in an 'outcome expectancy' survey form (can be repeated for each case study area and/or over time to document changes); learning interviews conducted with researchers (repeated annually) to reflect on their learning journey through the interdisciplinary research process.

This approach is more likely to document changes as they happen, to inform steps towards working in an interdisciplinary way, and steps towards 'learning' as a project. This all feeds-in to understanding interdisciplinary practice, and to developing guidelines for interdisciplinary best practice at the end of the fellowship.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF665BA8-43A6-4C28-BBFF-2C8C54B68A48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In development - feedback given the the project as each of these data-gathering efforts are analysed to inform and shape the project along-the-way.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5446629b2925c9.22244976</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Documenting learning and change within the STREVA project</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DAC0F953-2595-44A1-902F-FF598F4C57F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reporting on the Seminar - Risk Interpretation and Action (RIA): Decision Making Under Conditions of Uncertainty</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Australasian Journal of Disaster and Trauma Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/136cb256160f370659271d8597ab49b4"><gtr:id>136cb256160f370659271d8597ab49b4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>The World Social Science Fellows on Risk Interpretation and Action</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54465fe6767c79.24350589</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/L000709/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6DEB3C9-18A0-4A06-87C5-8C347DF98C60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>63F3D26F-05D5-477D-9F77-C6C8AC47C7DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Research approaches</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
