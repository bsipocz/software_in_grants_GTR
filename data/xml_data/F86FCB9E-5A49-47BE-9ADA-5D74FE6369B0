In this uncertain and unpredictable context, we require new approaches to understand complex pathways into and out of poverty, directing attention to poor people's collective capacity to bring about transformative change i.e., their agency, as constituted by social networks and relations with nature, and mediated by science and technology. Our aim is to develop the concepts and methods of an innovative 'relational agency pathways approach', drawing on theories from Science, Technology and Society studies and the 'pathways approach' to poverty reduction and social justice, which emphasise interactions between social, technological and environmental change.

We will develop this new approach to understand diverse pathways out of poverty for smallholders and the landless in agriculture, in two arenas. First, we will study how small farmers and farmworkers adapt new technologies on the farm, as their cultivation practices are transformed due to technological and environmental change. Second, we will study how farmers turn a harvested crop into a commodity for the market, negotiating their relationships with credit providers and traders. Both these arenas played out dramatically under the 'Green Revolution', from the 1960s onwards, when technology, markets and government support were used to intensify agricultural production. 

The first geographical focus of our work will be on the North Arcot region of Tamil Nadu, India, a classic exemplar of the Green Revolution in Asia, where extensive historical data since the early 1970s are available. Collaborating with our co-investigators at Madras Institute of Development Studies, and collecting new life history data in the field, we will map long-term agency pathways into and out of poverty constituted by changing technologies, natural resources and social worlds, as lived by people of different genders, classes and castes. We will test the approach in Machakos County in Kenya (in collaboration with our co-investigator at African Centre for Technology Studies), where several attempts have been made to get a Green Revolution off the ground, but none have been sustainable. In addition to relying on archival data and collecting life histories using ethnographic engagement with the study's participants, we will use a workshop format to collect data on how people evaluate diverse pathways out of (and into) poverty along a range of criteria derived from conventional indicators of welfare and well-being as well as those designed by the participants themselves.

To communicate our approach in other low-income contexts, we will develop a training programme for junior researchers. There will be broad-based participation from researchers, policymakers and farmers throughout the project, and we will organise a final workshop in Kenya, which will bring these participants together in a safe space for collective learning, where our findings and approach can be confronted with their different knowledges and experiences.

We will present our work in academic and policy forums, produce policy briefs and web blogs and a short documentary film (to engage with audiences beyond academia and policy). We see our research to be of interest to at least five groups: a) government institutions attempting to intensify smallholder agriculture through better use of natural resources and new technologies; b) rural development organisations (including non-governmental ones), active in organising initiatives for poverty alleviation; c) academic researchers working on agricultural sustainability and poverty issues in the global south; d) environmental NGOs at international and grassroots levels; e) farmers' associations such as the East African Farmers' Federation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our impact approach rests on four pillars of co-production, accessibility, innovativeness and relevance. In the context of efforts to achieve a sustained Green Revolution transformation in LICs, this project will recast farmers' agency from being a problem, to being constituted by relational processes in ways that allow them to escape poverty. Central among the intended end-beneficiaries of this project are poor people in rural areas, including the farmers and workers whose agency has been under-recognised by existing programmes. Our project will contribute to new approaches for realising these benefits for poor people in rural Africa and India by revealing policy-relevant lessons drawn from the successful transformations observed in North Arcot (Tiruvannamalai and Vellore districts). The immediate beneficiaries therefore are regional and national public policy-making institutions in Africa and India, international agricultural development organisations/initiatives, smallholder farmers' associations, and civil society organisations in both regions (see Pathways to Impact for a list of names). 

To maximise the relevance and potential for instrumental impact from our research we will ensure that beneficiaries' needs and priorities are taken into account from the beginning. The inception workshop in India will be attended by the project advisory committee from India and Africa, who will help frame the research with the core team, ensure relevance and define interest in policy networks. The inception workshop will involve selected stakeholders in co-designing the project's outreach strategy through the use of an adapted Participatory Impact Pathways Analysis (PIPA) as used by the ESRC STEPS Centre. This will map networks of stakeholders, articulate knowledge about their relationships, networks, pathways of influence, attitudes and interests, and identify potential ways to communicate and engage with them. This in turn will inform communications and engagement strategies and messages, including the use of existing digital platforms, papers, briefings and meetings. The project's Advisory Committee (see Pathways to Impact for membership) will provide further guidance on how our research can meet policy and other decision-making needs at continental (African Union), regional (East African Community) and local (civil society organisations, reached through our advisors) levels. Co-production of knowledge throughout is a vital component. The use of Multi-Criteria Mapping (MCM) in India and Africa will identify under-recognised priorities, values and visions of diverse possible pathways out of poverty among a diverse set of stakeholders. The final workshop of the project will be held in Kenya and will involve researchers and other policy-linked stakeholders from Africa and India, and members of the advisory committee. As well as project findings, a documentary film will be shared, presenting the findings in a persuasive, memorable and accessible medium.

To build a lasting legacy from the project and reach wider audiences, a series of academic outputs (Working Papers and journal articles) will be shared via a strategic alliance with the ESRC STEPS Centre and Future Agricultures Consortium, alongside blogs, opinion pieces, methods summaries, the film and other digital outputs. This includes using targeted mailing lists, dedicated and high-profile space on existing websites, and social media to encourage engagement with the project among wider academic and practitioner groups. A final training workshop for junior researchers will allow the research impact to live on beyond the end of the project. This workshop will launch and use a relational agency pathways approach training manual. The project design enables sharing of perspectives, learning and capacity to take place between our researchers, advisors and wider users between India and Africa, also opening potential pathways for further interactions and projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>409878</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Inception Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>60E98136-1717-4896-AB70-8FEC7B496788</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Report: Inception Workshop (16-17 February 2017, MIDS Chennai)

This report presents a summary of the discussion at the project's inception workshop held in Chennai, as well as steps ahead in the work plan of the project which was updated after the workshop. The workshop was attended by the project's advisors and a small number of other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. During the workshop, the project team made presentations on the background of the research and its underpinning questions as well as the conceptual approach and methodology to be used. The presentations sparked a round of rich discussion and feedback from the advisors and other stakeholder. This feedback led to substantive deepening of research planned in the project.

Research background
In the 21st century global poverty poses significant new challenges. Complex mixes of climate change impacts, resource conflicts, politico-religious wars (with large-scale refugee displacements) and growth-inequality nexuses work in tandem with structural mechanisms of social exclusion and unequal exchange to pile new vulnerabilities on the historically marginalized. This entanglement of social and economic structures with new risks and uncertainties demands new approaches for apprehending poverty, as a dynamic and complex process constituted by evolving networks of relations between humans and between humanity and nature, mediated by science and technology. In this workshop, we aim to focus on and discuss the outlines of one such theoretically informed and empirically grounded approach, which we call the 'relational agency pathways approach'. 

This approach aims to build on: a) conceptual insights on agency, constituted by relations between humans and non-humans, from Science Technology and Society studies, particularly Actor-Network Theory (ANT) (Callon 1986; Latour 2005); and b) the ESRC STEPS Centre's pluralistic 'pathways approach' to poverty reduction and social justice, which emphasizes interactions between trajectories of social, technological and environmental change (Leach et al. 2010). In order to develop this approach empirically, we aim to use historical time series data from village studies carried out during the so-called Green Revolution (GR) in North Arcot region (Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts) of Tamil Nadu in South India (Gathorne-Hardy et al. 2014; Harriss-White and Harriss 2007). Analysis of these longitudinal data will be complemented with life histories methods from anthropology (Crapanzano 1984; Kothari and Hulme 2004). The empirical aim is to reconstruct contrasting pathways into and out of poverty for people in different social positions.
 
Developing the approach in Tamil Nadu, we aim to test it in Machakos, Kenya. The aim of the empirical testing work in Machakos is to generate lessons about GR transformations in Kenya which has undergone a very different set of pathways as compared to South India. The testing process will be used to adapt and extend the relational agency pathways approach to facilitate its adaptation for use in diverse contexts. Overall, we aim to enable a reciprocal exchange between the conceptual (ANT, pathways approach) and the empirical (longitudinal data, new data from the field), in which the North Arcot and Machakos empirical material 'speaks back' to help re-build the concepts and methods (Jensen 2014).

Feedback from stakeholders at the workshop
Following presentations on a brief literature review of the East African GR experience, on the outlines of a relational agency pathways approach, on the historical overview of data collection in North Arcot, and on methodologies to be adopted in the project, discussions between the advisors (and other stakeholders) and project researchers highlighted several points of attention. These points include:
1. Suggestion made to draw on literature from West Africa, for instance the corpus produced by scholars at Wageningen University (NL), using technography and other farmer/practice-centred approaches. 
2. Pay more attention to approaches to technology in agriculture, used by some CGIAR institutes such as ICRISAT. The overall framing of such institutions are different from other multilateral ones and may provide a more complex picture.
3. Older debates in agrarian studies (and poverty) in India are far removed from the conceptual underpinnings of the relational agency pathways approach. In this context it is important to situate the project's conceptual framing in relation to the existing literature, for opening up avenues for exchange and learning.
4. Need to take into account structural disadvantages faced by farmers within a policy framework driven by the agenda of pushing people out of agriculture, as sometimes mandated by the World Bank. The National Skill Development Council report says that 18% population in agriculture has to be reduced. While salaries of public sector employees have gone up exponentially there are only minimal increases in minimum support prices for farmers. Is it a deliberate strategy to push people out of agriculture? This might be done incrementally, as governments might collapse if it is done abruptly. If policies are reframed, people will not need to move out of agriculture. Agriculture cannot be sacrificed beyond a point.
5. In Kenya, two thirds of the land is semi-arid and therefore more suited for livestock rearing than agriculture, but development policy appears to prioritise agricultural development. Might it be important to bring pastoralism into the picture, particularly in Kenya part of the study?
6. Need to fully elaborate, before fieldwork, how will life histories be used to map agency of relational complexes? How will they be able to capture structures obstructing people's ability to act?
7. Is there a possibility of accounting for lack/loss of agency within the project's framework? The example of demonetisation in India is cited which is a classic example of how hegemony in the Gramscian sense unfolds, as there is a lack of protest despite material deprivation.
8. How will the relational agency pathways approach to be developed in this project speak to older debates on poverty, while appreciating that there are critical differences between African and Asian contexts of poverty? This needs to be spelled out, even if some earlier definitions of poverty as universally applicable have been highly problematic and contested. Also, the way poverty is defined by institutions, states and development experts often differs from community definitions of poverty.
9. It might be worth examining if and how upward mobility manifesting in the form of access to new housing, ownership of mobile phones, and motor vehicles may be accompanied by decline in some dimensions of well-being such as nutrition due to loss of 'traditional' food cultures?
10. Might it be worth examining the role played by 'pro-poor' populist policies and public distribution system played in Tamil Nadu? More broadly, it might be important to appreciate how structural relations of caste and gender shape access to resources and goods.
11. Evidence shows that since the 1990s there has been an increase in real wages. Does this mean that the landless may be better off than small/marginal farmers?
12. Would it be useful to outline the genealogy of ANT (one of the bases of relational agency pathways approach) - what conversations were scholars such as John Law and Bruno Latour entering? Which theoretical frameworks were they building on/ or challenging?

Post-workshop plan
In response to the feedback provided at the inception workshop, the project team has prepared an interim work plan, particularly in relation to the India part of the project. Tasks associated with the work plan are listed below:
a. Literature review on relational approaches to poverty (dynamics), including work on social capital and social exclusion, while making connections to relational agency (of the poor) and agrarian transformations associated with the Green Revolution: coordinated by M. Vijayabaskar (CoI, MIDS) and Joanes Atela (CoI, ACTS)
b. Conceptual outlines of the Relational Agency Pathways Approach, while accounting for performativity (of economics and poverty lines) and linking up with older structural approaches (as well as structuration): coordinated by Saurabh Arora (PI, SPRU) and Ajit Menon (CoI, MIDS)
c. Reviewing the literature on North Arcot's Green Revolution history and poverty, including an overview of data collected by Professor Barbara Harriss-White (BHW) and others since the early 1970s: led by BHW (Independent Consultant, Oxford)
d. Reviewing the wider Tamil Nadu (TN) agrarian context, also to aid in selecting 24 life history 'cases'. Literatures on agrarian policy in TN (as well as at the national level); caste-based politics and political economy of vote banks including redistribution of various types (northern TN; gender, power and labour (TN); agrarian movements (TN); technological change in Indian agriculture: led by Divya Sharma (Research Fellow, SPRU), supported by Saurabh, Barbara, Ajit and Vijayabaskar.
e. Overview of research methods including Life Histories (in anthropology and development studies, Critical Junctures (also focussing on instances of non-functioning of technologies and institutions); Multi-Criteria Mapping (MCM): led by Divya Sharma (supported by the PI and CoIs).
f. Aligning the conceptual and the methodological to be able to address poverty issues identified in Points a, b, c and d above. This alignment must be able to address &amp;quot;multiple interconnected agrarian and non-agrarian economies&amp;quot;; various 'phases' of the GR in terms of state and market participation as well as farmers entanglements with newer technologies (continuous GR?); trends in gendered labour participation; impacts of caste politics and public distribution systems; rise of parallel local-level governance institutions such as SHGs (including any role they might have played in agricultural extension); and changes in market infrastructures (including contract farming, procurement agencies, influence of Minimum Support Price). Ultimate aim to capture most of these dynamics in the field through the mapping of relational life histories.

About the PIPA
The PIPA session was the final half-day activity of a two-day workshop involving researchers of the project and members of the Advisory Committee, drawn from India and Africa. We aimed to draw on the experience of the project's advisors and researchers to build on the intentions outlined in the project's Pathways to Impact (see proposal), articulate potential routes or opportunities to engage with actors, networks and processes, and set the wider context for this engagement. 
The structure used in the workshop was as follows:
? Discuss and agree the vision of the project, as it relates to societal impact - including the problem being addresses, and the project's aims in engaging with particular groups
? Elicit a list of key processes (including policy processes), events and networks with which to engage 
? Undertake a mapping exercise to identify actors with whom the project might engage, and discuss their roles and how to reach them
? Discuss some tools for monitoring and evaluation (this took place on the following day, with the core project team).
The PIPA should be seen as a longer-term approach which includes this initial workshop, as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation, periodic review and adaptation throughout the life of the project. 
More information about the STEPS Centre's approach to PIPA and experience of it can be found in this short summary on the STEPS website, which includes a list of recommended further reading.

Vision of the project
This vision is drawn from the original proposal to DFID and the concept note for our inception workshop in February 2017. This represents a broad set of aims for the project, including the given feedback at our inception workshop, which should be further refined to ensure they're in proportion with the resources we have at our disposal.
This vision was discussed and broadly agreed before undertaking a mapping exercise to identify actors with whom the project might engage.
Problem formulation
? Current dominant approaches to rural poverty reduction are either methodologically individualist or structuralist, focussing on transformation of productive and institutional structures as well as individual behaviour, through adoption of modern efficient technologies and rational ideals. 
? The agency of social actors, especially poor people, is underplayed. Poverty reduction programmes do not sufficiently take account of relations between/among social actors, ecology and technologies, how these relations are formed and changed, and the implications for pathways out of poverty

Our aims:
? National and international agencies &amp;amp; programmes (e.g. CAADP, National Task Force on Agriculture) involved in agriculture in India and Kenya (and elsewhere) use ideas &amp;amp; evidence about relational agency more in their thinking, planning and practice.
? Political parties, who have strong influence over policy making for agricultural development, understand more about the actual desires and needs of farmers and landless labourers. 
? Research organisations use and adapt/scale up the approaches we develop to better understand how to tackle rural poverty, and these insights further inform policy &amp;amp; practice. 
? Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), including faith-based organisations, use these insights &amp;amp; approaches in their advocacy &amp;amp; support for farmers, landless workers and their families. Through CSOs and the media, we influence industry associations and private companies to listen to farmers'/landless communities' concerns.
? Smallholder farmers associations are engaged in debates about how farmers relate to technology. 
? We (the project team) develop new concepts &amp;amp; skills and build our capacity to use them in further collaborative projects. 
We recognise that our project can only make a contribution to these aims, and that other activities and processes will also help or act as barriers to achieving them. As we cannot predict outcomes with certainty, we will track our engagements and efforts, using the original PIPA exercise as a reference point. 
With that in mind, there follows a list of key relevant processes, events and fora identified in the workshop which the project should bear in mind in its engagement activities.
Key processes and events of relevance to the project
National or global events
? 2017 (August): elections in Kenya. These include regional elections. 
? 2018: World Development Report, usually published early in the year. The theme for 2018 is education as a driver for development.
? 2019: Elections in India

Processes 
? Budgeting processes at country level

Events to use as engagement opportunities
? Farmers' Union meetings - for listening to farmers' concerns (India)
? Machakos Agricultural Show (Kenya)
? Annual CAADP Partnership Platforms (Africa). 2017: 31 June - 2 July 
? AU Science &amp;amp; Technology meeting in Cairo, July 2017 (via Mohammed Kyari)
 
Key networks and fora to engage
These may be useful points of contact in reaching larger networks.
? State Planning Commission - via MIDS
? Network for Rural and Agrarian Studies
? Meetings of Ministers of Agriculture/Economic Affairs. Go through permanent secretaries, via the AU system - first point of contact would be Dr. M. Kyari.
? East African Commissions - go via David Wafula.
? Association of African Universities - a key channel for spreading information via the academy in Africa - go via Dr M. Kyari.
Socio-ecological factors 
? There is a drought at the moment in Tamil Nadu. People's responses to the research may be affected.
? A rise in farmer suicides in TN was attributed to the drought.
? Among consumers, there is rising interest and demand in organic food. 

Actor mapping: reflections on mapping exercise and notes from discussion 
Background
Part of the PIPA process involves an exercise where the participants place coloured circles on a large sheet of paper. Each circle represents an actor or institution. This is followed by an opportunity to group them to show commonalities or pathways of influence. 
Colours are used to denote broad 'types' of actor (e.g. research institutions/NGOs/donors/media) while recognising that sectoral boundaries are not fixed. In the end the colours were not consistently used, but give a rough idea of the balance between different sectors. An Excel table (see below) gives more detail of the sectoral differences.
The aim is to articulate a shared understanding of actors to set the context for research and impact for the project. 
The map is not an end in itself, and explicitly recognised as being incomplete, but is there to enable discussion and act as a visual reminder when it comes to reviewing the PIPA later on in the project. 
 
The following notes summarise the discussion that followed the mapping (see attached images in separate files for full size). 
In the stakeholder map a loose distinction was made between organisations and actors at national levels (India and Kenya), and an international level - while recognising the interactions between them. Because of time constraints, networks of relationships were not mapped in detail - instead, actors were mapped largely by sector, but we talked about relationships and pathways of influence during an open discussion over the finished map.

Notes on actors: behaviour, networks and routes of engagement
International actors
Large donors and international organisations (CGIAR, DFID, GIZ, UN, DFID, FAO, AU etc) are known to meet together (e.g. breakfast meetings) to co-ordinate or discuss work 
Other large campaigning organisations (e.g. Oxfam and ActionAid), who may be outside that immediate circle, would still have policy and advocacy people who would aim to influence the international donors. 
India
We discussed the need to include landless advocacy groups and organisations in our mapping of actors and recognise their importance.
Dalit Land Rights Forum is a landless advocacy organisation - most of the others are farmers' groups. Makaam is an NGO but works with landless people. It is an association of NGOs.
As for farmers' organisations, Devinder Sharma (a member of the Advisory Committee present at the discussion) convenes Kisan Ekta, the largest Indian collective of farmers' unions with a membership of 65 organisations. As an advisor to the project, he would be a primary source to connect with farmers' organisations. Devinder Sharma would also be able to help us to connect with newspapers and television media.
For reaching out to the Indian research institutes listed, MIDS would be a key channel - able to send out briefing papers etc. and recognised by other academic institutions as a source of evidence. 
For providing evidence to policy-makers, the Standing Parliamentary Committee on agriculture is a key body - they hold consultations which we could contribute to.
Africa
For the African Union, Dr Kyari suggested that he could help the project to approach the AU.
In the Kenyan context, Joanes Atela (ACTS) suggested that regional-level organisations are a good way to reach political parties. There are regional research organisations that can convene policy debates (eg the members of the Africa Sustainability Hub - ACTS, ATPS and SEI Africa). For Kenyan actors it's easier to go through strategic regional bodies given their histories of engagement with policy makers.
Kenyan institutions are usually very open to attending a discussion - though whether this leads to action on the ground is less predictable. The challenge is to move from a policy being adopted on paper, to action. 
One organisation to spearhead / champion messages within a sector (Kyari).
You can try to message all, but meanwhile work more intensively with a 'champion'. 

Note on group composition
The discussion included more advisors and researchers from India (between 10-12) than Kenya/Africa (3), and this may have been reflected in the number of stakeholders identified for each country in the mapping exercise.
Influence and attitude mapping / review process
Because of time constraints, we decided to prioritise a discussion of potential policy spaces and methods of engagement, and to omit the detailed discussion of attitudes and influence that would normally be part of the stakeholder mapping exercise. It was suggested that the project team discuss power/attitudes at a later date, after interacting with some of the stakeholders identified. This will be part of a scheduled review of the PIPA, where we will update it, assess progress and identify new opportunities, as described in the project proposal.

Next steps
Once this initial report has been reviewed by the group, the Impact, Communications &amp;amp; Engagement officer will undertake a further prioritisation of actors and policy spaces, refine initial priorities for engagement and draft a longer-term communication plan. This will refer to the wider research plan and be created with inputs/feedback from the project team.
Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation
A table has been created to record engagements and interactions with actors during the life of the project, with details of outcomes. 
These will be used towards the end of the project to show the response to our evidence, and construct informal 'impact stories' showing our influence on policy, capacity and debates. 
This table is shared on the Sharepoint platform and all researchers on the project will be able to contribute to it directly.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c665b76c1a57.70637348</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5355E50C-6C8F-4CCE-A50A-9A8039D233A7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Methods Vignettes: Life Histories</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a1f1a540a17df651a48404e1a0a7b139"><gtr:id>a1f1a540a17df651a48404e1a0a7b139</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Arora, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c93799395222.60090507</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N014456/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
