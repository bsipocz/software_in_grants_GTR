Extension</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/N002474/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Env-Rad-Net was set up in November 2012 to engage and enhance UK scientific research in the grand challenge areas of: (i) radioactive waste geodisposal and contaminated land management, (ii) nuclear decommissioning, and (iii) nuclear incident / accident preparedness and response. To do this, the network specifically sought to develop uptake and use of STFC central facilities (namely the Diamond Light Source (DLS); Central Laser Facility (CLF); ISIS; and the STFC Scientific Computing Department (SCD)) within the environmental radioactivity research community. The use of state-of-the-art techniques at these facilities would then provide much needed underpinning science to meet these grand challenges. Over the past 2.5 years the Env-Rad-Net has engaged the UK's research community to make a step change in the use of STFC facilities for environmental radioactivity research. This has included hosting and supporting network events; increasing the capability of STFC facilities to analyse radioactive samples; providing technique and safety training to 100+ researchers; funding projects to initiate new research at STFC and international facilities; bringing international best practice and experience to the UK; and engaging with industry/government agencies. These activities have catalysed the rapid development of environmental radioactivity research on STFC facilities. However, to maintain momentum, and further grow capability in this area, more work is needed. We seek to extend the Env-Rad-Net to ensure added value and provide a lasting legacy. We will do this by: (i) delivering a small research project scheme to further develop the community's size and expertise, and to continue building experience and capability at our associated STFC facilities, (ii) delivering / facilitating targeted networking and training activities that are designed to grow the network and enhance knowledge transfer (iii) working closely with STFC facility scientists and the National Nuclear Users Facility (NNUF) scheme, to inform and shape future large scale infrastructure developments at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) that are relevant to the network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE EXTENDED NETWORK

1. Industry / Implementers

Site License Company's (SLC), Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and Radioactive Waste Management (RWM) Limited: Many SLC's are responsible for contaminated sites, UK Decommissioning and Radioactive Waste Management activities are overseen by the NDA. NDA-RWM Ltd. is responsible for implementing the geological disposal of UK Higher Activity Wastes, and they are currently developing the UK geodisposal safety case. Staff members from these bodies are part of the existing network and they are strongly supportive of the requested extension. During the Env-Rad-Net extension we will act to strengthen extant links, e.g. via RATE and through other networking activities, as this provides a ready path to impact and knowledge transfer (KT) in our 'grand challenge' research areas. 

National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL): NNL is a government owned, contractor-operated company. It is responsible for supporting the UK's strategic nuclear R&amp;amp;D and for developing specialised, high-level skills in the nuclear environmental sciences. Several NNL staff members have participated in the Env-Rad-Net and will maintain their activity in the extended network. Further, a key member of the NNL team (Dr Joe Small) will continue to serve on the Network's steering panel. 

2. Regulators

The Environment Agency is the regulator for radioactive waste discharges and disposals in England. It maintains a high level of interest in research and development related to environmental radioactivity and its impact and has links to the network. Network members also have policy links to geodisposal (DECC, CoRWM), new nuclear power (DECC and BIS), nuclear security (FERA) and nuclear incident response (GDS). Engagement will all of these bodies ensure two-way knowledge transfer and impact.

3. Wider public

Across the network, we have a strong track record in public engagement (see PTI). 

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE EXTENDED NETWORK?

1. Industry / Implementers

SLC's, NDA, NDA-RWM Ltd. and NNL will benefit from the enhanced capability, and knowledge generated by the network. Further, at a higher level the network will directly address issues affecting environment and energy, and more specifically will produce new research that can be used in underpinning management and implementation issues across the UK nuclear portfolio. In addition, the enhanced research capability within the community and at the STFC facilities developed by the network will provide a new and valuable capability for research undertaken or commissioned by these organisations. 

2. Regulators

The release of radionuclides from nuclear sites, nuclear security, and safe management of nuclear wastes and the subsequent mobility of radionuclides in the environment are subjects of intense public concern. At the same time, radioactivity spans the remit of many research councils and government departments. By consolidating the network between STFC facilities and the wider nuclear environmental science community, we will assist in developing a refreshed, highly capable research base in this area. It is clear that a healthy research base will provide capability in providing independent scrutiny in forward plans for geodisposal, low-level waste disposal, and for contaminated land and nuclear legacy management. This capability will be crucial in implementation of these significant managerial, technical and environmental challenges over the coming decades.

3. Wider Public

We will participate in outreach events to inform the public about research activities in this nationally important research area. These activities will contribute to informing the public about ongoing environmental radioactivity research in the UK, helping to enhance their knowledge base and contributing to the overall national discussion associated with the network's grand challenges.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Earth and Environmental Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Optical imaging of environmental Np speciation</gtr:description><gtr:id>81360EB5-88C5-434D-8604-5BFF1B653EFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Th project has been awarded an EPSRC grant (see further funding).

Ascertaining and predicting the migratory behaviour of actinide fission products in natural and engineered environments is imperative for the long-term safety assessment of radionuclide contaminated sites and nuclear waste repositories, meaning understanding the long-term storage behaviour and mobility of radioactive elements is crucial to the UK's nuclear problem. The problems associated with environmental release of actinide ions have stimulated numerous studies into the bioavailability, biotransformation and mobility of actinide species. However, almost all studies rely on X-ray absorption techniques, which are limited in concentration, spatial and temporal resolution. By contrast, one and two photon (confocal) fluorescence microscopy has the unique ability to attain much greater spatial and temporal resolution, including 3D image mapping. We have previously shown that uranyl(VI) biosorption, internalisation and reduction with metal reducing bacteria (Geobacter sulfurreducens) can be visualised in real time in the absence of probe dyes with the one and two photon luminescence imaging facility at LSF. We now wish to extend these studies to the more radioactive ion neptunium. However in order to achieve this, specialized triple containment housing for the microscope needs to be constructed.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project was supported by the Env-Rad-Net small project fund.

The UK has high and intermediate level radioactive wastes containing large quantities of neptunium and plutonium. Currently, it is UK Government policy that these wastes should be contained within a Geological Disposal Facility (GDF). Within a GDF, sorption to minerals will be one of the key factors limiting the release of radionuclides to the biosphere. If the environmental behavior of transuranic elements, such as plutonium, are to be predicted a molecular scale understanding of their speciation is essential. High intensity X-rays generated by synchrotron facilities can be used to probe radionuclide speciation via X-ray Adsorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Currently, it is possible to perform XAS on low-level Np samples at the Diamond Light Source (DLS). However, the high radiotoxicity of Pu isotopes makes analysis at synchrotron facilities challenging as comprehensive safe systems of work and dedicated sample cells are required. Hence, there is currently no UK capability to analyse higher activity samples and those containing Pu isotopes. Therefore, the key aim of this project is to develop the procedures and sample cells that are required facilitate analysis at the DLS. Further, this new capability will be used to probe the behaviour of neptunium and plutonium in systems containing relevant minerals.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project was supported by the Env-Rad-Net small project fund.

The formation of cataract in humans due to occupational or accidental exposure to acute ionising radiation is well documented. However, little is known about the effect of long-term chronic exposure through the life span of organisms exposed in the natural environment. A recent study of voles at Chernobyl (Lehmann et al. Scientific Reports 6; 2016), apparently found significant increases in cataract incidence at cumulative doses as low as 10 mSv. This generated significant media coverage and, if true, would represent a major challenge to current radiation protection regulation. Key flaws in this study, however, were the method of field sample preservation/preparation, and the subjective nature of the lens opacity measurement.

The purpose of the proposed study is to further develop methods for stabilisation and preparation of fish lens samples to measure any ultrastructural changes to the constituent crystallin proteins within the lens fibre cells caused by environmental radiation damage. We will also collect fish lenses from lakes contaminated by the Fukushima accident to complement samples we have from Chernobyl. To analyse these unique samples, we plan to use the low angle X-ray diffraction beamline (I22) at the Diamond Synchrotron. This will provide highly sensitive data giving objective and quantitative results.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project was supported by the Env-Rad-Net small project fund.

Legacy disposal sites contaminated with radionuclides, such the Little Forest Legacy Site (LFLS) in New South Wales, Australia require long term management strategies. Due to costs and potential spread of contamination, in-situ containment/stabilization of radioactive wastes is often preferred to excavation and reconditioning. Using novel colloidal silica based grouts to immobilize radioactive wastes is a promising option due to its low cost, low injection viscosity and chemical inertness. However, little is known about the impact of the grouting process with these grouts on the geo-mechanical properties of the soil and wastes, and the environmental behaviour of radionuclides. In this project we will use X-ray Computed Tomography to investigate the geo mechanical properties of model soil and wastes and the behaviour of radionuclides of interest (e.g. Sr, Cs, U) before, during and after grout injection and setting. Finally, these experiments and analyses will be complemented by experiments performed with materials/solutions from the LFLS in order to inform on the best strategy for radioactive waste immobilization.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project was supported by the Env-Rad-Net small project fund.

Through collaboration with researchers from Kyushu University, Japan, we seek to build on work at the University of Manchester (UoM) concerning 'hot' particle characterisation and weathering in environmental systems (NERC NE/M014088/1, 2015-2018; AWE/EPSRC studentship, 2016-2019). Specifically, we will develop sample preparation facilities at the UoM for synchrotron based micro-focus and nano-probe characterisation of heterogeneous, radioactive samples. Such facilities do not currently exist in the UK other than for work with low-level U samples. To commission this new facility, we will prepare a range of novel Fukushima-Daiichi and Chernobyl hot particle bearing samples for characterisation at the Diamond Light Source (DLS). The sample preparation capability will then be made available to the wider nuclear research community, providing a long-term Env-Rad-Net legacy.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project was supported by the Env-Rad-Net small project fund.

Iron metal is an inherent component within the nuclear fuel cycle and over extended timescales, it will corrode to produce both reducing conditions and a range of iron (II/III) bearing oxides. In radioactive waste storage and disposal steel containers will be used to store a range of wastes which will contain heterogeneous materials and may be grouted. In addition, iron metal or &amp;quot;zero valent iron (ZVI)&amp;quot; is proposed as a treatment for radioactively contaminated land. Here, nanoparticulate ZVI is introduced to the contaminated subsurface and allowed to corrode and react with mobile radionuclides such as U(VI) and Tc(VII). Here, we will explore reaction of U(VI) and Np(V) with corroded steel coupons under a range of solution chemistries to explore: (i) the nature of the corrosion products; (ii) the distribution of radionuclides on the corroded steel surface; and (iii) the relationship between radionuclide distribution and speciation and the different iron corrosion products.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project was supported by the Env-Rad-Net small project fund.
