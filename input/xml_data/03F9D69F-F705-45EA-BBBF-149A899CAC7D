The subsequent damage to blood vessels and the downstream blood supply can lead to critical organ failure. In some cases of vasculitis there is an associated antibody that can be detected in the patients' blood, directed against components within the white blood cells and called anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies or ANCA. A particular feature of some cases of ANCA associated vasculitis (as well as other autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis) is the formation of granuloma. These are inflammatory aggregates of white blood cells, in which individual cells have transformed themselves by joining together, we believe in an attempt to better clear a provoking insult- although in autoimmune diseases it is not always clear what the provoking factor may be. These granulomas are the hardest disease manifestations to treat as they frequently relapse and appear to respond less well to standard treatment regimens. Why these granuloma form, why they persist and how they can be better regulated are the questions we hope to address in this proposal. 

We have generated a model of granuloma formation in a laboratory setting, using the component white blood cells that make them up, and have found that we can replicate the changes found in patients' tissues. We established that one of the proteins in the white blood cells, against which the ANCA react, may be the provoking factor promoting granuloma and now wish to investigate this further, by dissecting out the mechanism of granuloma formation and better understand the factors that regulate them. We believe that this will lead to novel and more successful ways of treating these disease features and could have more widespread applicability beyond ANCA associated vasculitis, for management of a host of other diseases in which granuloma are a prominent feature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal will use a novel PR3-mediated in vitro granuloma model to investigate granulomata formation in AAV patients and attempt to translate this model to an in vivo setting. Our specific aims are to:
1. Define cellular requirements for PR3 induced granuloma formation. We will isolate PBMC and serum from AAV patients with PR3- or MPO-ANCA, with or without evidence of granuloma, healthy controls(HC), and patients with sarcoidosis. We will compare giant cell(GC) and granuoma formation in these groups using purified monocytes, monocytes with purified CD3 T cells, and whole PBMC, to understand the impact of B cells. The studies will be repeated using cells from HC or PR3-ANCA patients in the presence of PR3 or ATP with or without a P2X7 receptor antagonist to investigate whether this compound may represent a novel potential therapeutic target for granulomatous disease.
2. Defining the role of ANCA or the PR3-inhibitor alpha 1 anti-trypsin(A1AT) on granuloma formation. The granuloma model will be repeated using cells from GPA patients with or without ANCA and HC, in the presence or absence of purified LPS-free PR3-ANCA IgG, MPO-ANCA IgG, control IgG, diverse anti-PR3 mAb, or A1AT to test the effect on granuloma formation.
3. Examining if there are differences in gene expression between different multinucleate GC which mirror those found in tissue granuloma. Using different stimulation conditions with PR3, IL-4, ATP and concanavalin A, we will generate GC, isolate their RNA and microarray them to investigate differences resulting from the stimuli and compare them to GC isolated from patient tissue.
4. Can PR3-induced granuloma provoke disease in vivo? We will test the impact of persistent PR3 antigen expresion in C3HeB/FeJ mice known to be susceptible to development of necrotising granuloma and in vasculitis susceptible WKY rats. We will coat polystyrene beads with/without human PR3 or MPO, embed them in Matrigel and place them into different rodent tissues</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this research project will be both academic and clinical. On the academic side, the key discovery will be to better understand basic mechanisms mediating granuloma formation in autoimmune diseases, with specific emphasis on systemic vasculitis. Data will be of considerable interest to a wide variety of medical specialities including nephrology, immunology, rheumatology, ophthalmologists, ENT and respiratory physicians, as well as other specialities in which autoimmune disease feature heavily. Furthermore, these studies may have significant clinical impact, helping to define risk factors for granuloma formation that may allow preventative strategies to be developed for subsets of patients, as well as potentially defining new treatment regimens based on antagonising pathways that underly granuloma formation.

In addition to the academic and clinical impact this work could have significant economic and societal impact. Although individual autoimmune diseases may be rare, overall autoimmunity is common, affecting in one form or another up to 15% of the population, and granulomatous manifestations are a common feature of many such conditions. Autoimmunity is reported to be the second highest cause of chronic illness and as such consumes significant healthcare resources. It leads to many complications impacting on many diverse providers. There are further economic costs incurred in managing the considerable disability resulting from prolonged immunosuppression therapy which is required for the frequently relapsing features of disease. The ability to define high risk groups who may benefit from particular preventative therapy or require more intensive monitoring or treatment may allow us to deliver more rational care while minimising the adverse effects of therapies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>248371</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6709CDEB-EE00-4A89-B2F5-D7CA49567778</gtr:id><gtr:title>Diagnostic and management challenges in Goodpasture's (anti-glomerular basement membrane) disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1a7f9ba341f2cc3577197315056e4cdb"><gtr:id>1a7f9ba341f2cc3577197315056e4cdb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Henderson SR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0931-0509</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa944713a5ae4.89758815</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>569C7A7F-040D-4F51-A2C1-32782A3F3CE9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Practical Nephrology: A User's Guide to Kidney Disease</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/68567252c7a2759f6a54010a8ce0251b"><gtr:id>68567252c7a2759f6a54010a8ce0251b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scott R Henderson</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>GdokmUAFwhc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7BD69EC8-FC6E-45F5-BAB0-9CBDACDD2301</gtr:id><gtr:title>Occam's razor or Hickam's dictum?
