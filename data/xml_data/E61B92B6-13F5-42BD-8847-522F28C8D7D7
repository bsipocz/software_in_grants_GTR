It not only dramatised the war of information but also made visible a whole series of networks in the culture of communication that were usually invisible in peace time. The MoI had to adapt rapidly to a series of internal pressures and external circumstances, and did so with limited resources. Its organisation was partly the product of employing what was to hand and, when necessary, improvising: 'Make Do and Mend', therefore, is particularly apt. Located in Senate House, the MoI created a vast amount of publicity material, employing artists, writers, journalists, researchers, and film directors to devise films, radio programmes, posters, books, and exhibitions. The MoI also assisted other ministries in the production and distribution of publicity materials, including the Ministries of Food, Health, the Board of Trade, and the War Office. The MoI also encouraged private firms to publish informational material. The control of paper supply gave the MoI considerable power over a publishing industry suffering from acute shortages. The MoI's Censorship Bureau was responsible for the censorship of newspapers, journals and books. The Bureau required significant intelligence-gathering capacity, and good working relationships with newspapers and publishers. All these procedures were fraught with practical and ethical difficulties created by the exercise of overt censorship in an open society at war with a series of closed societies. As the model for the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's 1984, the MoI's influence continued to reverberate, but not just as metaphor. The difficulties of striking a balance between openness and social cohesion are subjects of fierce debate to this day.
The project will address some of the historical and cultural problems raised by the MoI by using the discipline of publishing history which, for the first time, is being applied systematically to government institutions. Publishing history investigates the relationships between author and publisher; between publisher, printer and bookseller; explores the nature of the relationship between reader and book; and also describes the ways in which reading materials survive in libraries and archives to influence the next generation. The complexity and range of our subject however obliges the discipline to move up a gear and embrace the broader subject of which it is a part: communication history. This studies the transport of materials (e.g. pamphlets, posters, handbills, exhibitions) and the transmission of all sorts of information through a wide variety of media (e.g. radio and film).
The project will analyse an extensive array of primary resources including materials available at the National Archives (TNA), the Imperial War Museum (IWM), BBC Archives at Caversham, Senate House, and Mass Observation at the University of Sussex. Additionally, this decade is the last in which those who were actively engaged with, or affected by, the MoI during the period will still be alive in significant numbers. There is still the chance to interview them and create an oral history resource that will otherwise be lost to us.
In addition to a comprehensive, scholarly history of communication, the project will make all the materials from our investigation available on the Web in the form of 'MoI Digital' which will consist of a virtual archive, containing all the material we have worked on, and a museum that explains MoI by use of striking examples from the archive, 'guided tours', and the facility to create personal collections by 'drag and drop'. The project will thus present its findings in a highly accessible way that will interest teachers, students, journalists, broadcasters as well as large numbers of the general public. Additionally we shall organize a physical exhibition in either Senate House or the Imperial War Museum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Interest in the project will certainly stretch well beyond academic circles. We aim to serve the needs of the wider public through the creation of MoI Digital and an exhibition. The website will include a chronology of the MoI, an extensive prosopography, information about Senate House, and a catalogue of the productions of the MoI. The museum element of MoI Digital will present a number of examples of MoI pamphlets and posters, as well as clips of radio and film programmes. 
Support for teaching: The project will benefit secondary schools and universities across Britain. Teachers will be able to draw on the website's biographies of notable authors or artists employed by the MoI, or direct students to war-time documentaries; they could illustrate their classes and lectures with posters created by the Ministry of Information and presented as part of the museum element of MoI Digital. Pupils will be able to use the website for their presentations and essays on the Second World War - always a popular subject - as well as for projects on individual authors or titles, or on art and artists. Additional local oral history projects could be undertaken by school pupils and university students which, posted on our blog, would help augment the project. Both schools and universities will be able to draw on the substantial resources available via the project's MoI Digital archive.
The third sector: The project will also benefit the archives and libraries which house collections related to the MoI or to WWII more generally. The scholarly history will make extensive use of the records of the MoI; the project will also explore the holdings of the British Library to uncover some of the publications of the MoI, and also the archives of publishing houses to illuminate the relationship between the Ministry and the book trade. The project will also draw on the records of Mass Observation, and the Reading Experience Database, hosted by the Open University. The history will therefore help to articulate a multitude of resources and make these collections more usable by academics in a wide range of disciplines. By displaying a significant collection of the MoI's publicity materials, particularly the posters and pamphlets in MoI Digital, the project will also extend the reach of TNA to researchers outside London, and, indeed, outside the UK. The project may also have an opportunity to provide material that will augment the digital collections of the National Archives and the Imperial War Museum, and thus support their efforts to conserve the originals.
The media: The Second World War is still vivid in the popular imagination, and interest in the Home Front is growing. Programmes on the subject on TV and radio are common, and feature films still frequently draw on WWII for plots or settings; and local newspapers and radio stations frequently feature older local residents who have a wartime story or experience to relate. For this reason the oral history project will generate a lot of interest both nationally and locally. MoI Digital will provide a wealth of textual and graphical material that could be used to contextualize this coverage. 
Policy-makers: The MoI was controversial - nevertheless it had considerable impact both in the UK and abroad. Politicians, civil servants, and others currently concerned with explaining the decisions and acts of local and national government to the public will learn something through studying the successes and failures of the UK's first government-supported public relations unit. 
Local communities and the wider public: The project will help support local museums and collectors wishing to put their collections of Second World War memorabilia into a broader and more intelligible context. The prosopographical study that will be part of MoI Digital will prove an invaluable resource for family and local historians. This will help to encourage the public to engage further with its cultural heritage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>782409</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A presentation to the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing (SHARP)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4FC8D7C0-8502-4AE8-ADAD-B36A0D16D32A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was considerable discussion and suggestions that links might be made to colleagues working in similar areas in Italy and Germany.

This talk was designed to be combative and provoking, and it succeeded. I was surprised only by the fact that many more agreed with the new proposals than I had expected.

1. The interpenetration of commercial organisations (such as publishers and advertising agencies) and the MOI, particularly in terms of the graphic style of printed outputs, public relations strategy, and the running of multi-media campaigns.

2. The size of its printed output both at home and abroad. The MOI was clearly one of the largest international publishing systems operating in the UK in the 1940s. Its most popular UK publications sold in their millions, and its most successful title sold over 14 million copies over a four-year period.

3. The partial but extensive occupation of many commercial premises in the UK by the MOI.

4. The speed with which feedback was available to the MOI through the Home Intelligence Reports (daily for the first six months of the War, then weekly to the end of 1944).

5. Its extensive use of Wartime Social Survey reports for longer-term planning of campaigns

6. The number of London-based small-scale ministries of information created for various governments in exile (including the Polish and Chinese governments). 

7. The discovery of the watershed year of 1942 during which the MOI consolidated its position, stabilised its relationship with the people and the government, and began to function with increasing success.

8. The remarkable level of public approval of the MOI by 1944-45.

9. We are exploring the substantial contributions made by commercial graphic artists to the extensive output of visual materials by the MOI, including posters, book covers, comics, and postcards.

10. We now understand the complicated system of film distribution and presentation delivered by the MOI both in the UK and abroad (particularly in the USA).

11. Our knowledge of the ways in which the MOI operated in Latin America has expanded hugely, particularly in relation to framing the anti-Nazi debate in terms of religious freedom. This was promoted by claiming the UK's tolerant and positive attitude towards Catholicism, and demonstrating that Catholics in the UK were part of a united front against the Axis Powers.

12. The ways in which the MOI helped mortgage the UK's political and cultural future by arguing, in many of it publications aimed at Latin America and Africa, that it favoured self-determination and the emergence of nation states (perforce tacitly accepting the anti-colonial argument).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We intend to pursue these further; but it is already clear that we have mapped out a number of areas that will deserve further exploration, not merely by historians, but those interested in social policy, in communications, and the creative economy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4EE5F6F7-F1CB-4D86-85D9-ECF866E738D4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56daf3c64cfb79.44427192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.moidigital.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The MOI's Home Intelligence reports (daily for the first few months of the War, afterwards weekly to the end of 1944) gave an account of public opinion, current rumours, and morale; on occasions they provided direct evidence of the public's response to the MOI's activities. The information was gathered from each of the MOI's regional centres, and from London. This almost real-time feedback was augmented by a series of longer-term, more analytical reports in the form of 'Wartime Social Surveys'. The daily reports were reprinted [Paul Addison and Jeremy A. Crang, _Listening to Britain_ (London: The Bodley Head, 2010)] but no other part of this extraordinary exercise in collective self-consciousness has been made readily available. After extensive negotiations with TNA, we have been given permission to have all this material re-keyed. This will mean that it will be completely string-searchable. At first this resource will be mounted on the project's intranet but, by the end of 2017, it will be publically available via the MOI Project's website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9343A9A5-5C5A-46FB-AA89-1741336D5DE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Access to such a substantial amount of contemporary reporting will allow historians of the mid-twentieth century, local historians, family historians, and the general public the chance to search for people, events, publications, regional matters, and crazy rumours speedily and accurately - something that would not be the case had we simply digitised the typescript. We think that this will do for the mid-twentieth century what the records of the Old Bailey did for those interested in the social history of the country in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dad678386e53.56913418</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Re-keying the Home Intelligence Reports and Wartime Social Surveys of the MOI</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is yet another part of the database of all MOI outputs.

However, it also employed people on part-time contracts, and brought others in as consultants. Unlike most other ministries and government agencies, the MOI was not exclusively run by civil servants: publishers, writers, poets, film directors, musicians, composers, exhibition designers, and commercial artists were employed extensively, and this created an extraordinary social and cultural mix. Apart from the most famous (e.g. Kenneth Clark, John Betjeman, Mervyn Peake), most are not known. We are in the process of creating a prosopography of all the names we come across in our work on the primary evidence. We have, for instance, discovered a telephone directory of August 1942 which has been transcribed, but more commonly names emerge from lists of departmental staff, management diagrams, and individual correspondence.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B4C41BF8-610B-425F-84E0-5AFD51A03A61</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We shall be able to trace the career of named individuals as they moved across sections or rose (or fell) in the hierarchy.

The dynamics of innovation, the driving force of individuals and groups - as they form alliances to push an idea or promote a campaign - will be more easily seen as we identify more people and locate them physically in the building and socially within the MOI's organisation. We shall be able to judge the relative success of sections as their staff numbers increase or decrease. We get quite a few enquiries from family and local historians about individuals and their possible links to the MOI. By the end of the project we shall be able simply to refer them to the on-line MOI Prosopography, which will be completely searchable.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dadbdd0cb2a4.38270307</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Prosopography of those working in and for the Ministry of Information</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We are in the process of digitising materials from TNA records which are then OCR'd, and then string-searched to produce an index which will prove a powerful tool for exploring large quantities of text speedily and comprehensively.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A25FBC10-0B12-4391-85A1-3DE72846A8B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These are early days so the impact is modest, but it will grow rapidly.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54608df163ef47.73561084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Materials from TNA</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Employing 1930s plans of Senate House, and a 1943 telephone directory of the building, we are reconstructing the layout, the location of various divisions of the MOI, and the location of key individuals within the building.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2DBEED13-05C7-4617-8A7A-A7F49E677956</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is in its early stages but we hope eventually to make all this information freely available using a graphic interface on the Web.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54608ee608d877.62778727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Senate House groundplans and directory</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We are collecting data about individuals and groups, the locations they occupied, the decisions they took, and the consequences of those decisions in terms of policy and products (such as pamphlets, books, posters, exhibitions, broadcasts, and films), and the reaction to these in terms of reports from Mass Observation and Home Intelligence weekly reports.
