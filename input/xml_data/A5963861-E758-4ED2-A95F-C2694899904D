I work on statistical network models, which are basically mathematical descriptions of patterns of interactions between discrete entities such as friends on Facebook, or in my research, human genes.

Every cell in your body has the same set of genes - but the reason that a cell on the end of your finger looks very different to a cell in your brain is that different sets of genes are switched on and off in the finger compared to the brain. In other words, we have a set of finger-specific genes, and a set of brain-specific genes, and by switching these genes on and off at the right time the cell is able to gain the correct physical characteristics for its location in the body. This switching on and off of genes is itself controlled by the influence of other genes.

Friends on Facebook group together naturally, and so do genes which interact with and influence each other. Just as friendship groups can change and develop over time, so can these interacting groups of genes. So when these gene groupings change in an organism, it's often reflected in some physical change, which might be healthy (for example natural growth), or unhealthy (for example unnatural growth, like cancer).

My research is particularly focused on understanding mechanisms like these, by which genes control healthy growth in the brain, and on the close connections between this sort of healthy growth, and unhealthy growth in cancer. We hope that by understanding these healthy mechanisms better, we can also shed light on these deadly diseases. So understanding more about these microscopic mechanisms controlled by our genes is very interesting in itself, but it can also help us to understand more about serious illnesses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Understanding interactions between genes and their transcriptional regulators is a fundamental question in genomics. Network models are a natural way to represent groups of these interactions. Transcriptional regulation in terminally differentiated cells is characteristic of cell type and environment, and changes in these regulatory interactions are inherent to disease progression. 

Biomedical science in the high-throughput genomic age has, for over a decade, been developing ever more innovative ways to collect increasingly vast quantities of data. However, the statistical techniques to represent, analyse and interpret such data still lag behind the means to generate them. In particular, there remains a lack of good computational statistical methods to analyse time-varying biological networks, i.e., methods which take account of dynamic changes in gene-regulatory interactions as cells are specified and change state. I will address this point, by developing novel time-varying statistical network methodology, to represent and analyse dynamic genomic interactions in neural development and related oncogenic processes. These models will be implemented as efficient computational algorithms, and will draw on a range of different data-types. They will be implemented as straightforward, freely available and well supported software packages for easy adoption by end-users in basic science biomedical research. 

In carrying out this research programme, I will develop models at the interface between biology and statistics, in a project involving collaborations with leading names in both fields. In doing so, I will answer important biological questions, and make new computational statistical tools available to others working in the biomedical sciences.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Quantitative skills (including mathematics, statistics, and computation applied to 'omics' data) are identified as an MRC Skill Priority (http://www.mrc.ac.uk/documents/pdf/mrc-strategic-skill-priorities/ ). My work will have a direct impact in this priority area. I will develop novel mathematical / statistical / computational methodology, tailored to a specific 'omics' application. I will develop new models of how genomic regulatory structures are set up in development and rearranged in disease: time-varying statistical network models are an ideal approach to this problem. However, there is currently a lack of accurate, computationally efficient methodologies of this type, tailored for this application.

In order to fulfil this research agenda, I will need to develop specific skills. Developing these skills during this MRC fellowship will have a big impact on achieving my ultimate career goal, of becoming an international expert in building novel computational statistical methodology for large-scale genomics studies. This skills development will increase my understanding of specific biomedical science topics (particularly the molecular biology of development and oncogenesis in the neural lineage). This skills development will provide me with practical knowledge of the techniques used to collect the data I will model, which will be invaluable in understanding the sources of uncertainties and biases in these data. This skills development will continue to build my expertise at the interface of the biomedical and mathematical sciences.

My work will directly benefit experimental and computational biologists who will make immediate use of the novel methodology I will develop. This will begin with the collaborators named as project partners. While the research I carry out will be focused on development and oncogenesis in the neural lineage, it is likely that this work will be able to be successfully applied to analysis of 'omics' data gathered in relation to equivalent healthy and pathological processes in other physiological systems. In this way, the impact will be extended to collaborations I will initiate during the period of the fellowship. Ultimately this impact will be extended still further to the wider research community via peer-reviewed publications in leading journals, and through publicly available free software which is straightforward and intuitive for end-users. The methodology which I will develop will also be of interest to the wider statistical science community, as development of time-varying network models is a frontier research area in that field.

Impact on society will result from this work via healthcare, in the form of increased understanding of the processes which lead to serious diseases, in particular cancer. During the course of the fellowship I will investigate genomic drivers of the progression of cells through developmental and oncogenic processes, and the mathematical and computational technologies I will develop will allow many others in the biomedical science community to carry out similar investigations. Understanding more about these processes has the potential for impact relevant to a range of diseases. For example in oncogenesis, the cancer stem cell model has been shown to be relevant to tumourigenesis in a range of physiological systems, and forcing cancer stem cells to differentiate greatly reduces their tumourigenicity.

I have specific plans for public engagement, particularly focused on presenting research ideas in a developing country. In this way, I intend to inspire others to take an interest in cutting-edge science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>274742</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P014070/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
