In truth, a considerable proportion of Tibetan religious literature is de facto produced collectively, rather than individually. Much is also recycled, often through the potentially transformative medium of memorisation. Larger disciplines, notably medieval Hebraic studies, have in recent decades arrived at sophisticated understandings of the interactions of memorisation and written text, and the communal construction along an anthological model of anonymous literature by scribes and scholars acting as 'tradents'. Yet, in the absence of such work in Tibetan Studies, Tibetanists still generally present the untenable convention of a single authorial attribution, as though describing modern Western literature. This solecism is especially acute when applied to mystically revealed literature (gter-ma), a very powerful genre in Tibetan religion, where close analysis shows much of it to be de facto collectively produced. Previous study of revelation (gter-ma) has focused heavily on the initial and sometimes theatrical revelatory process of the individual visionary, generally unreflectively crediting him with sole authorial status of the resulting texts. We propose to contextualise this by focusing on the laborious 'backstage' processes of the subsequent editing, writing up and later expansion of the revelation. This crucial and tightly controlled procedure, which typically draws upon a large amount of pre-existing literature, requires a skilful balance between innovation and tradition. It can often employ several greatly learned people gradually to transform what might often only be a very rudimentary text revealed by a mystic, into a large scale finished literary product ready for public consumption. \nOur project will be the first ever such investigation into what revelation and authorship actually entail in Tibetan Buddhism, and as such, it is long overdue. We intend to take as a case study the extremely influential revealed literature on the tantric deity, rDo-rje Phur-pa, produced by Dudjom Rinpoche (bDud-'joms 'jigs-bral ye-shes rdo- rje, 1904-1987). Dudjom was a visionary revealer himself and a prolific scholar who wrote or edited texts for a number of different revelatory traditions, including his own and those of his predecessor, Dudjom Lingpa (1835-1904), as well as his elder contemporaries Zilnon Namkhai Dorje (Zil-gnon nam-mkha'i rdo-rje, born c. 1867) and Drakngak Lingpa (Drag-sngags gling-pa, 1871-1936), and on the invitation of the Bhutanese, those of Pema Lingpa (Padma gling-pa, 15th-16th century). He also codified the transmitted textual heritage of the rNying-ma school, and he produced one of the most vibrant and popular Tibetan revealed ritual traditions today. The focus on this single polymath thus encompasses not only the Dudjom revelatory tradition but three quite separate revelatory traditions also, which may provide contrasting cases. The example is particularly accessible to us because of the availability of the texts, and because we are able to consult the first generation of Dudjom's inner circle of students. To analyse minutely the components of this revealed literature and to expose the many and often laborious processes of its gradual maturation will help provide a much truer picture of the broader principles and practices in the creation of new Tibetan scriptures. Since contemporary Tibetan revelatory methods preserve features of great antiquity that were used in India and many other parts of Asia, this research may also contribute to understanding the vast genre of Buddhist scriptural revelation in general, and will mark the first in a series of such investigations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate impacts on 1. Contemporary Tibetan &amp;amp; Mongolian communities 2. Educational NGOs 3. Global Buddhist communities 4. Media, local communities, wider public. \n\nThe Society for the Wider Understanding of Buddhism (So-Wide) &amp;amp; Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies (OCBS) are Oxford-based global NGOs in which the PI has a major role. We will host presentations, audio and video (possibly contributing to a documentary) recorded by the professional unit of the PI's Balliol College, to go out on Oxford's section of iTunesU, So-Wide, OCBS, Voices from Oxford, Mongolian &amp;amp; Tibetan sites, &amp;amp; media outlets.\n\n1. Our work could significantly impact contemporary Tibetan &amp;amp; Mongolian understandings of their own cultural heritage &amp;amp; appreciation of the creative independence of their traditional literatures, so often caricatured as unoriginal translations from India or China. gTer-ma covers the full gamut of indigenous literature - much biography, mythology, geography, history, medical texts, are explicitly gter-ma. No adequate account of indigenous Tibetan thought is conceivable without understanding gter-ma. With Tibetans and Mongolians redefined as Chinese minorities or seeking a post-Soviet identity, assertions of indigenous cultural creativity assume great political import. Our work can impact by indexing the vibrancy of indigenous literary production: Dudjom was the greatest gter-ston of the 20th century, major historian of his time, &amp;amp; compiler of the rNying ma bKa' ma Canon.\nThe leading culture hero of modern educated Tibetans is Gendun Chopel, whose most momentous work was compiled posthumously by a student under Dudjom's guidance. Dudjom also wrote the introduction, supplied the paper, and arranged publication, so that some of the dominant dGe lugs school accused Dudjom of distorting the work, which appears more rNying ma than dGe lugs. Without directly addressing this huge controversy, our study will certainly clarify Dudjom's styles of literary intervention, of key interest to Chopel fans. \n\n2. Many educational NGOs work in Tibetan areas of the PRC &amp;amp; Mongolia. Better understanding of indigenous modes of creativity can help them, given the major contemporary renaissance of gter-ma revelation. Our output will be freely available to key players - Trace, Rabsal, etc - in an easily understandable digest, to accompany extended output.\n\n3. A major unresolved ambiguity troubled Buddhism from its inception, and remains contentious: was Buddhist scripture solely the historical Buddha's words, or did revelations of later Buddhist masters have equal authority? Ongoing scriptural revelation has been a major force in Buddhism for 2000 years, yet is not accepted universally. De facto, most of Eastern and Northern Buddhism comprise the revelations of later masters - often disguised as the historical Buddha's words to retain credibility even amongst their own followers, let alone the Southern Buddhists who reject them as heresy. Controlled methods of revelation evolved around the first century CE in India, but were later banned in China, and disappeared from 13th century India, nowadays remaining alive only among the Tibetan rNying ma. Today, with all strands of Buddhism face to face, mutual understanding is imperative, &amp;amp; modern education demands modern historical understanding. Our work permits assessment of this very controversial issue in Buddhist history, in the light of real evidence. \n\n4. A documentary on cultural creativity in Tibet and Mongolia is possible. We will also offer public discussions with experts in other faiths, debating the variety of revelation in different faiths, centered around a discussion of the contrast between Abrahamic &amp;amp; Buddhist understandings of revelation. In Tibet, revelation is predicted, structured by convention, collectively managed, &amp;amp; owes as much to deeper levels of spiritual truth believed to b</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>332341</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wallace UCSB Living texts and open canons in Buddhism</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38E3863E-8C91-4317-9E05-5703D70C4A8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture presented to the Religious Studies departmental colloquium, University of California, Santa Barbara, attended by potential and actual postgraduate students, and participants in academic research.

Such texts are known as 'Treasure' (gter-ma), and those who discover them are known as 'Treasure Revealers' (gter-ston).
The Treasure system has attracted previous scholarly interest, but so far primarily focused on the person of the Treasure Revealer, or general features of the Treasure system. None has yet addressed the more laborious but necessary task, of minutely examining, within historical and cultural context, what was actually revealed, the Treasure texts themselves.
We undertook this task, taking as our case study works relating to a famous C20 Treasure Revealer, Dudjom Rinpoche, who contributed to several other Treasure traditions as well as his own powerful lineage. This corpus contains Treasures revealed over the last five hundred years, a highly representative sample.
Our findings challenged previous understandings:
[1] Past studies assumed Treasure to be quintessentially innovative, the prime mechanism through which Tibetan religion takes new departures. However, the texts we inspected are better described as highly conservative. We found newer Treasures to be repetitive of previous Treasures or other pre-existing texts, frequently reproducing whole sections verbatim. Only very rarely did they innovate, and even then, only marginally. While individual styles of writing and dialect were accommodated, actual content predominantly conformed to established precedent.
[2] Past studies have assumed as a point of departure the creative self-expression of an individual Treasure Revealer at a particular moment. Yet the Treasures we analysed are better described as communally authored, often over long time-spans. Mostly, they are neither authored individually, nor at any one moment, and can remain open to further redaction or evolution by different hands over many generations.
[3] Previous studies envisaged Treasures as typologically separate and different from conventionally composed sacred texts. Yet we found the two genres, in literary construction, contents, and purport, not much different at all.
[4] When new Treasures do show innovations, however marginal, they tend to be smoothed out by later editors seeking to integrate them with long established communal practices, thus retaining only few distinctive elements. Here too the communal dimension proves predominant.
[5] Unique features of new revelations may be initially held back, before being integrated into later ritual compilations, including those of different Treasure lineages, should a Revealer span several lineages.
Our conclusions are based on detailed, forensic, sentence-by-sentence dissections of several famous Treasure texts. This 'hard', systematic approach enabled precise quantification of where in the previous literature each passage of Treasure text had been borrowed from. This proved amongst the most important aspects of our findings. Patterns of textual borrowings were not random, but deeply meaningful, even potentially creative of new social realities. They reflected rich networks of religious affiliations covering large expanses of space and time, occasionally augmented by further cross-fertilisations of disparate religious lineages. These little-known networks are of considerable importance to understanding how Tibetan Buddhism functions within society.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have found that most Nyingma tantric ritual literature of whatever genre is modular in nature, and secondly, a considerable proportion of the same modules are shared by several genres alike, be they Treasure (gter ma), Transmitted Literature (bka' ma), canonical tantric scriptures (rNying ma'i rgyud 'bum), or compositions and compilations of named authors. This sharing of the same modular structure, and also of so many of the same textual and ritual modules, lends a certain homogeneity to all the different tantric ritual genres. For these reasons, we believe our investigations into authorship in Treasure literature point to similar issues regarding authorship within Tibetan tantric literature as a whole, and beyond that, to varying degrees as yet unknown, in other genres as well. 
Thus, our work is of potential applicability to those working in Tibetan and Buddhist studies focusing on literature of other genres. It asks the fundamental question, what is authorship in Tibetan religious literature? Our findings seriously challenge the widespread contemporary Tibetological practice of unreflectively attributing works to single authors at specific moments, as though the modern Western model could so seamlessly be transposed onto pre-modern Tibet.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D9C2A267-5584-4CD4-A8F3-4BC4B6AA4ABC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5459079715caa7.81315701</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage,
