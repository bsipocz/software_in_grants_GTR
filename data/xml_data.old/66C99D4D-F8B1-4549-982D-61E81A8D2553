reference</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J01950X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>RefNet proposes an EPSRC research network advancing the interdisciplinary study of reference by linking communities that have so far tended to work in near isolation from each other. 

Reference is the process of making sure that a user/receiver can identify an entity - for example a person, thing, place, or event. Reference can be accomplished through language, but also through for example pointing, gaze, highlighting, and combinatons of the above. Reference can be considered the &amp;quot;anchor&amp;quot; of communication, and as such it is crucial for practical applications, from robotics and gaming to embodied agents, satellite navigation, and multimodal interfaces. 

RefNet will foster collaboration between researchers in Computing Science and researchers in Psycholinguistics, and between researchers and practitioners in industry and the public sector. Through the study of reference, RefNet will build a wider interdisciplinary skills base for research on communication that will be of crucial importance at a time when computing science is becoming closely interlinked with other disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main purpose of RefNet is to change the way in which research communities interact, and the way in which they are able to influence, and be influenced by, practical applications.

Reference is a key mechanism in communication, &amp;quot;anchoring&amp;quot; words to things, people, events, times, places, etc. Understanding reference is therefore an important aspect of human knowledge. RefNet will contribute significantly to this understanding, though its skill building activities (e.g. the Summer School, bursaries, lab visits), and through improved interactions between Computational Linguists and Psycholinguists. In many cases, understanding will take the form of precise quantitative models.

Reference plays a crucial role in many practical applications of computing science, such as multimodal interfaces, Geographic Information Systems, spoken dialogue, gaming, Satellite Navibation, and robotics. RefNet will help the design of these applications by offering the sophistication of computational psycholinguistics. Confidence in the potential for RefNet to succeed in this regard can be gathered from the support letters (attached) from AT&amp;amp;T, Nokia, and Data2Text. 

Reference also plays an important role in daily life, including situations where errors can be fatal, such as emergency medicine, where protocols for spatial reference (e.g., to explain where on a mountain the victim of a mountaineering accident lies) are still error prone. A better understanding of reference and direction giving could improve such protocols. If this were to happen, lives would be saved, for example because quick and accurate direction finding is often crucial (e.g. in rural areas).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56387</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bremen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research stay of Timothy Meo (Rutgers) with Vivien Mast (Bremen) for exploration in perceptual and dialogic grounding of reference</gtr:description><gtr:id>40598B32-2F98-41B3-9691-4853685E06D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Integration of software.

Examples of these skills are eye-tracking, algorithmic models, bayesian reasoning, and mixed-effects modelling. The summer school is an attempt to introduce and discuss these techniques, focussing on the production of referring expressions as an example. The summer school focusses on the linguistic phenomenon of reference production because it is one of the best examples of the convergence of the above-mentioned disciplines.



The Summer school contained 5 courses (Algorithms; Eye-tracking; Statistical techniques; Linguistic theory of reference; the acquisition of reference), which will be delivered sequentially to allow each participant to take part in every course. 5 invited speakers have agreed to give evening lectures. One month after the start of registration, more than 70 people have applied to take part in the summer school; 55 were admitted.

The most important impact of this activity was that 55 young researchers were able to learn about the latest theories and techniques relevant for their work; these include algorithmic modelling, eye-tracking, mixed effect models, and so on. They were also given ample opportunity to learn directly from each other and from the 15 lecturers involved in the summer school. And yes, plans were made for &amp;quot;future related activity&amp;quot; (the most appropriate of the options offered by the menu below).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2730898403.3119850cd43290</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/RefNet/events.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RefNet Round Table event in Aberdeen</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF473278-0BA1-4504-97C6-C843B1FBF350</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The core of this event was a symposium to which 13 invited key researchers, from all over the world, and from both computer science and the social sciences, came to Aberdeen to discuss the emergence of predictive models of comprehension and production, and the increasing use of neuro-scientific methods. These two topics have great relevance for reference (which is the main focus of the project). They were chosen as the themes of the Round Table event because they have much wider significance across the cognitive sciences, and because they are topical.

Additionally, we accepted a number of posters (following an open call) detailing recent research that sheds light on these themes; these posters were visible throughout the event and discussed during a special session. 

The event concluded with a 2.5-hour discussion about future cross-disciplinary research projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99540256220.11205560</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.matt.qa/refnet/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Production of Referring Expressions: bridging the gap between cognitive and computational approaches to reference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>010B6A1D-488E-4518-AC90-2A52B44CBDF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event, which took place on 31 July 2013 in Berlin, built on two earlier workshops on reference to link computational work on reference with work on the same topic by other cognitive scientists.

The general quality of the papers presented was high. Two developments were of particular interest:
1. Contributions that apply Bayesian methods to reference production for the first time
2. In-depth discussions concerning the appropriateness of the experiments that were done.

After the workshop, interest in RefNet has grown considerably. THis is especially clear from the requests for funding for lab visits that we have received in recent weeks. The workshop ws also notable for linking algorithmic and experimental work with neuro-cognitive studies, a novelty in our area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1727311733.8561560cd42fca</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/refnet/index.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings disseminated via RefNet are being used extensively by other researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7237090B-B824-477B-A1FF-45C47022AD01</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54647a7faf6c15.02304999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have learned a lot about how computer scientists and experimental psychologists can work together effectively to construct detailed and empirically well-founded models of human behaviour.

Also, it is time to investigate how the lessons learned in the study of reference carry over (or compare with) other areas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>855AE4F8-038B-4237-A7E6-5728CCFE54E4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463983b9c0238.12141882</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>An extensive list of publications relevant to the study of reference, from all areas of Cognitive Science.</gtr:description><gtr:id>275C5884-6237-490E-B63B-12C766595D79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work is being used in many areas now, including the automatic generation of captions to photographs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58860bd8516f68.28706211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A Living Bibliography</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/RefNet/publications.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0AD113B8-D383-4320-85B4-7DFEBF62F53E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Computational Models of Referring: a Study in Cognitive Science</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/df11c6d9c2ebb1af67818416d7d769a7"><gtr:id>df11c6d9c2ebb1af67818416d7d769a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kees van Deemter</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-262-03455-5</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5886052442d775.85792417</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A947D72C-6967-4958-BF81-28D73C543C60</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reference and the facilitation of search in spatial domains</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Language, Cognition and Neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1abd830f6b5ce4908d38aca13f5e3b5c"><gtr:id>1abd830f6b5ce4908d38aca13f5e3b5c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Paraboni I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dee6c35681d0.61615094</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE705866-729F-4A76-824C-2665FB198B9B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Computational Models of Referring: A Study in Cognitive Science</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b46d79e998961f06dea789cf20bef352"><gtr:id>b46d79e998961f06dea789cf20bef352</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Deemter Kees Van</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780262034555</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d99f4e151fe3.41388865</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71ADCCA3-6729-4400-B3E2-A4767E7E7DBF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Editorial: Models of Reference.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1915cc86df036c9480bfcc29428bbdd7"><gtr:id>1915cc86df036c9480bfcc29428bbdd7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van Deemter K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-1078</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa163ee007502.33550222</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FC6BCA14-0947-4AAA-AE38-970E23D7B052</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reference production as search: the impact of domain size on the production of distinguishing descriptions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognitive Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/857cde9c09928065284111f29db63c5d"><gtr:id>857cde9c09928065284111f29db63c5d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>A.
