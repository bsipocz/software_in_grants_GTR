Food industry and the SMEs will benefit through application of the harmonised detection methods and technologies, as well as consumers, through high quality and safe foods. IFR leads on Personnel Exchange and Mobility which aims to assess best practice on issues related to researcher exchange and mobility with the intention of defining rules and criteria for implementing personnel exchange and mobility within the MONIQA network. Experiences and best practice from ongoing NoEs EuroFIR and NuGO will help shape the initial plans and activities for MONIQA. IFR will work closely with the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences (Vienna) and National Research Council (Rome).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>170050</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The European Commission funded MoniQA for five years (2007-2012) with the expectation that sufficient momentum
would be achieved to ensure some form of sustainable presence, adding-value to the initial investment. To this
end, a business model was developed including monitoring and exploitation of intellectual property to secure
future financing, and the legal agreements necessary to create an independent non-profit-distributing Association,
established in Austria, were sought from the consortium. Launched in 2011, the MoniQA Association comprises
some original partners - some are prevented by the legal statues from joining any organisation offering commercial
products or services - associate members, and new organisations from amongst the various stakeholder groups such as analytical laboratories, food manufacturers and retails, research organisations and government departments.
The mission of the MoniQA Association is to facilitate international research collaboration, and enable services and
products for food safety and quality assurance. Members will also contribute to the development and validation of
analytical methods, and provide training/ continuing professional development (CPD), consultancy services and
socio-economic impact assessment through the Association.
The MoniQA Association was registered as a non-profit-distributing association (Verein) in Vienna (AT), and is subject
to the laws of that jurisdiction, in August 2011, and was launched at the 3rd MoniQA International Conference in
Varna (BG) on 29th September 2011.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>459D9F57-BBAE-4C73-87AA-C9027725DE04</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54623ed73506a8.94802773</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Monitoring and Quality Assurance in the Total Food Supply Chain (MoniQA, www.moniqa.org) was a EU-funded Network of Excellence (NoE) working for safer foods by harmonising worldwide food quality and safety monitoring and control strategies. It was coordinated by ICC (International Association for Cereal Science and Technology, www.icc.or.at) and focussed on validation and setting of performance criteria for analytical methods with an emphasis on rapid methods and emerging new testing technologies, and their applicability and reliability in routine testing. At the onset in 2007, 155 scientists from 20 countries joined the consortium, which increased to more than 500 experts from some 40 countries. The consortium committed its knowledge and resources to providing reliable information and globally agreed standards, and a more rational approach to future regulation through socio-economic impact assessment. Outputs have affected existing food research, European industry and SME competitivity, policy and trade-relations, and consumers.
It will continue to impact these sectors through the MoniQA Association (www.moniqa.org), which was launched in August 2011 to advance global collaboration in food safety and quality assurance, facilitate research and consultancy, and serve stakeholders' needs globally.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The mission of the MoniQA Association is to facilitate international research collaboration, and enable services and
