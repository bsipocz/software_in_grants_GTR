Perennial crops grown for biomass production, such as Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow and the exotic grass, miscanthus, are a renewable energy source which is carbon neutral, because the quantities of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere on combusting the crop are equal to those absorbed by photosynthesis during crop growth. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Future policies are likely to encourage plantings of biomass crops, particularly as they provide new opportunities for farmers. Biomass crops differ from the annual arable crops and grassland they are likely to replace, in the habitat they provide, in their life cycle, growth characteristics and general appearance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is important to understand the impacts of changing land use to biomass crops in order to optimise the gains and minimise any potential downsides. Using two UK regions as study areas, this project will examine the sustainability of SRC willow and miscanthus relative to arable crops and grassland by comparing rural economics, social acceptability, landscape character, water use and biodiversity. The results will provide scientific tools for assessing where energy crop plantings can be placed for achieving maximum benefits.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>894503</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation and debate on biofuels at the Cheltenham Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28E9B5DC-7E7C-4536-8D66-F03FB7BD9A4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not easy to judge but some press reports

However, policy changes, rising concerns over the economic viability of energy cropping and increasing awareness of possible impacts on food security, water and other environmental issues, have checked the growth of the bioenergy and biofuel industries. Scientifically-based approaches which enable policy- and decision-makers to examine the possible impacts of different scenarios of energy crop plantings are urgently needed. For this to be satisfied, a robust evidence base and holistic approaches which enable integration across the different social, economic and environmental disciplines are also required. The UK interdisciplinary Relu-Biomass project focussed on filling in knowledge gaps though targeted research on the impacts of SRC willow and Miscanthus on visual appearance, social acceptability, biodiversity, hydrology and rural economics and has developed two approaches to provide integration and decision-making tools: GIS-based constraints mapping and Sustainability Appraisal. Continual engagement with stakeholders is an essential component of the project and in future, the expectation is that the tools will be utilised in planning expansion of energy crop plantings in the UK in ways which maximise positive impacts and minimise negative ones. Relu-Biomass biodiversity results are being used to revise the UK Energy Crops Scheme and advise policy on energy crop plantings by Natural England and Defra. They were also used by the NFU as evidence for including SRC as an option in the Campaign For the Farmed Environment.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>30EA4458-8D54-426A-B1CC-6616092FA7BB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544cc6c7e1fb02.52887928</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project investigated the implications of increasing the area of perennial biomass crops Miscanthus and short rotation coppice (SRC) willow in the UK. GIS was used to map variations in Miscanthus yield across England and, then to mask areas where the crop would not be grown due to constraints on land use (e.g. designated areas). Top grade land (classes 1 and 2) were excluded as most existing biomass crop planting is on agricultural land classes 3 and 4.The study showed up to 2 million hectares could be grown without impacting food production significantly or affecting other land use. A survey of 24 sites across England revealed that compared to conventional crops: Field margins of SRC willow and Miscanthus crops have more butterflies of conservation interest; Pest species of butterflies were less abundant; There were more weeds and a greater range of invertebrates in willow, compared with Miscanthus; SRC willow is likely to have a positive impact on the abundance of both farmland and woodland birds. There are however certain scarce, declining or otherwise important species that may be negatively affected;The effects on bird populations from growing Miscanthus are less clear. Measurements of water-use at commercial field sites showed: The rooting depth of SRC willow and Miscanthus is no greater than deeper rooting annual crops; The water-use of SRC willow is similar to that of a cereal crop, higher than permanent grass and lower than that of mature woodlands; Water-use of Miscanthus approaches that of woodlands; The net effect of converting land to biomass crops will depend on the previous land-use, the soil type and climate.Public surveys using computer generated landscape view before (top) and after (below) Miscanthus planting showed that most members of the public were not particularly concerned about the appearance of these new crops and thought that they would fit in well with the current agricultural landscape. People were more concerned with lorry movements and where biomass processing units and power stations would be built. Wider margins, smaller, scattered fields (rather than large blocks of planting) and local small-scale end-uses were slightly more favoured than other planting options. A wide variety of factors were found to affect farmers' decisions on whether to grow energy crops. Profitability was the most important factor. Impacts of the crops on farmers' existing systems and their attitudes to risk management, market volatility and environmental issues were also important.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Relu-Biomass biodiversity results are being used to revise the UK Energy Crops Scheme and advise policy on energy crop plantings by Natural England and Defra.
