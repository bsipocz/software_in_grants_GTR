Through analysis of government reports the research critically analyses the mechanisms of power and techniques of government used to inculcate norms of ?good mothering? into society. The project examines the role of both the state and the voluntary or ?third? sector in regulation. It also presents evidence about the ways in which abortion was accessed illegally in the community. This work is one of the first archival studies to reconstruct the experience of women accessing abortion illegally and to explore female subcultures of resistance. A significant aim of this post-doctoral project is to draw links between a contemporary politics of behaviour as evidenced by New Labour?s policy innovations in the areas such as public health and parenting and state policy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Therefore the research aims to add to contemporary theorisations about the nature, extent and efficacy of state power. In addition, the research explores the effect of regulation on the individual; specifically the effects of regulation upon women.&lt;br /> &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73317</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Currently, the findings have been used in an academic setting.

- a new theoretical idea - maternal governmentality - this refers to the way in which women, because of their reproductive capacities, were singled out for behavioural surveillance and reformation. The grant has uncovered how this regulation could occur in the form of voluntary and state maternal and child welfare initiatives. These initiatives aimed to make women into better mothers in the interests of the British race. This research has been written up into a journal article in the Journal of Historical Geography.



- new data on working-class healthcare and the provision of illegal abortion in industrial communities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This part of the research uncovered the ways in which working-class communities were slow to embrace biomedicine and instead relied on local and alternative healing cultures such as herbalism and spiritualism. Within these local alternative cultures, the project uncovered the provision of illegal abortion by a trusted local practitioner. This research places the abortionist within the working-class community. The case study of one practitioner revealed that illegal abortion was one of a wide range of services, from the irregular such as fortune telling, to the orthodox, such as midwifery, that she offered. This project has been written up into a journal article which was published in 2013.



- methodological and ethical reflections on using sensitive data. Using the ESRCs Research Ethics Framework, this part of the work on the grant sought to consider the methodological and ethical issues in historical research. In particular, the challenges of dealing with sensitive data such as information about crime or sexual behaviour were considered. The main focus of this strand of research was to consider the obligations researchers have to their research subjects, even when those research subjects are deceased. The outcome of this exercise was a journal article published in Area which served two purposes. Firstly, the paper acts as a call for greater consideration of these issues; and, secondly the paper offers some comments on how researchers can balance their needs with those of research subjects and funding council guidelines.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research can be put to use in a health policy making context. One large strand of the research has explored in detail the conflicting attitudes to biomedicine and continued reliance on alternative medicine for health and healing. Uncovering such attitudes in the past is important, since it helps ask useful questions in the present day about the role of alternative medicine in healthcare. All sections of this research have been used for teaching and education purposes on the undergraduate Geography degree course at the University of Cambridge.
