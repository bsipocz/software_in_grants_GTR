The rewritten judgments will help to illuminate the conceptual and practical challenges of securing children's rights within judicial decision-making and will explore how developments in theory and practice can inform and (re)invigorate the legal protection of children's rights. Each judgment will be accompanied by a commentary explaining the historical and legal context of the original case and the rationale underpinning the revised judgment including: the particular children's rights perspective adopted; the extent to which it addresses the children's rights deficiencies evident in the original judgment; and the potential impact the alternative version might have had on law, policy or practice.

This very modern, applied approach to legal scholarship is inspired by similar highly successful projects, such as the Feminist Judgments Project (2010). The Children's Rights Judgments Project is unique in that it illustrates precisely how children's rights can be integrated into judicial reasoning across a range of legal areas including health, administrative, education, immigration, family, child protection and criminal justice. Moreover, it explores this in a number of jurisdictional contexts, looking at how children's rights can inform deliberations in different national courts across the world, as well as in the international courts (the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, and the International Criminal Court). 

Leading children's rights academics will work alongside early career researchers to produce the judgments and commentaries. Judgment writing is a challenging and skillful process, demanding a balanced consideration not just of the rights and interests of children, but of other parties implicated in a particular case. Thus, the network will draw on the experience and guidance of two judges, and early drafts of the judgments will also be subjected to the scrutiny of other legal practitioners, representatives from the NGO sector and children and young people with a view to testing their feasibility and comprehensiveness. Other interested parties who are not participating in the network can follow progress on a dedicated Children's Rights Judgments website, which will include a reading list of seminal children's rights literature and good practice examples of existing children's rights judgments. 

The judgments and commentaries will be published as an edited collection which will be launched at the annual Socio-Legal Studies Association Conference in April 2017.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Demonstrating how children's rights norms and theories can inform judicial decision-making is the key rationale underpinning this network and is central to generating impact. In addition to the academic beneficiaries referred to in the previous section, non-academic beneficiaries will include judges, lawyers and children's rights campaign NGOs operating at domestic, European and International level. Ultimately, the outputs from the project will impact upon children and young people also. 

The network will impact on the beneficiaries in four main ways. 

First, the process of judgment writing will fill an important gap between academic and applied law. It will illustrate to those charged with applying and interpreting the law how the intelligence we have gained about children's lives, perspectives and rights, generated through a rich body of research, can be brought to bear more effectively on judicial reasoning. 

Second, the network will add a new dimension to the emergent legal method of judgment writing, demonstrating its application in an entirely new theoretical and normative framework. 
 
Third, the interactive format of the workshops supporting the network lends itself to a high degree of exchange between the various participants, and a distinctly collegial approach to the judgment writing. This will help to nurture strong collaborative links between children's rights scholars and practitioners at various points in their career, and stimulate open dialogue with non-academic stakeholders working in children's rights litigation and campaigning. It will simultaneously demystify the academic process as well as the judicial adjudicative process, whilst also exposing some of the stark challenges associated with balancing competing interests of the various parties implicated in cases. 

Finally, it is hoped that the production of revised judgments and explanatory commentaries that respond more explicitly to children's rights will demonstrate to the judiciary the possibilities inherent in a child-rights-based approach, inspire more creative, strategic litigation among practitioners and campaigners, and generate longer-term, positive effects for the protection of children's rights.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35697</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We commissioned an artist to produce some original artwork for the front cover of and at various points within the book in which the collection will be published.

The PI has already engaged in some judicial training in Scotland and Romania which has referred to the project methodology. Further plans are afoot to work with the Judicial training college to explore the possibility of integrating the findings of the project/methodology into their judicial training programme.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ADACC522-8846-4945-9CC9-C2CD169A5D25</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dfbd72e04f36.28499997</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The funding supported 5 workshops and the development of a (60+) strong international network of children's rights scholars and practitioners who have engaged in re-drafting existing judgments of various jurisdictions from a children's rights perspective. 28 judgments have been completed along with 28 accompanying commentaries. These are now going through final copy editing in preparation for publication. A contract for publication has been secured with Hart and the collection, 'Children's Rights Judgments: From Academic Vision to New Practice' will be published in the early summer 2017 and launched at the UK Supreme Court in Sept 2017. We have drafted three introductory chapters to the book exploring the role of judges in advancing children's rights.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have a number of plans to maximise the reach and impact of the work. First, we will present the key project findings at two forthcoming conferences to a wide, interdisciplinary audience: The SLSA Children's Rights Stream (A special session will be dedicated to the project) (5-7 April 2017); and at the World Congress on Family and Children's Rights, to be held in Dublin in June 2017. Again, a special session has been set aside for the project. We will then engage in a number of dissemination events with practitioners, particularly judges and child law practitioners across the UK, and perhaps further afield thereafter if funding can be secured. We would like to produce a follow-up summary version of the key findings/method to children's rights judgments for judges and will seek funding to achieve this. We are also exploring the option of developing child friendly versions of the judgments with a view to making the decision-making process more accessible to children.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8D55F33F-3791-4DCF-B030-B14733DFAB7D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dfbea093c4e0.02561181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/law/research/european-childrens-rights-unit/childrens-rights-judgments/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in an immigration judgment issued by a first tier tribunal judge in England</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>53014F57-8374-4F0E-A37B-F908104FE307</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9bc322d1104.69436478</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have, through the project, identified some core (5) components of a child rights based approach to judgment writing and illustrated how this can be applied by reference to the rewritten judgments included in the collection.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D448E8B0-73F1-49AA-800D-E2552C0F9FF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are just in the process of finalising the collection for publication, which includes details of the distinctive method to judgment writing.
