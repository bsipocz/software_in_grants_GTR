Such data is commonly found in a wide range of applications in science. The links may arise through the existence of networks, which contain explicit connections between objects (such as links between websites), or simply through weaker associations (e.g. we expect that in most images, most pixels will be of a similar colour to nearby pixels).

Examples of such data arise in many different fields. Applications in: physics (magnetism); biology (genetics, protein design, neural models); computer science (artificial intelligence, computer vision); social science (social networks); economics (the network effect); and engineering (target tracking), all share common underlying characteristics. In many cases, the application can be reduced to understanding the process by which a network is generated and to use this knowledge to predict future events. For example, one can envisage learning from previous examples of contact between known terrorists, inferring patterns of communication that mark them out as such. Knowledge of this pattern may then be used to identify terrorist cells from communication networks. Making such an inference in the presence of uncertainty (which is always the case when analysing real data) is a problem that lies in the realm of statistics. In order to obtain accurate results, the use of a technique known as Bayesian inference is usually necessary. Bayesian inference is usually implemented by means of an iterative algorithm known as a Monte Carlo method.

However, using Monte Carlo methods to perform inference in models of large networks can be extremely computationally expensive: the algorithm can run for days, weeks or months without producing a useful result. This means that in practice these methods cannot be used, so that large networks cannot be analysed using &amp;quot;model based&amp;quot; statistical techniques. This project is concerned with the development of algorithms that are much more computationally efficient, with the aim of reducing computational time to more manageable levels. These algorithms build on some of the most recent developments in statistics and machine learning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will develop software (based on statistical methodology) that will be used by other researchers. Therefore its pathway to impact is indirect, in that it is reliant on working with researchers whose application areas can lead to economic and societal impact. The academic impact of the work is a crucial component in the path to other impacts.

Despite this indirect pathway, the potential for impact from this research is significant. Algorithms such as the ones developed in this project, when implemented in freely available software packages, represent the gateway to making sense of network data.

The algorithms that will be developed by the project will help describe how a network is divided into communities, and the relative effect of different local interactions within and between these communities in giving rise to the global structure of the network. The analysis of large networks is central to, for example: studying the organisation of the human brain (a topic central to understanding conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); understanding the behaviour of consumers; and in understanding how people form their opinions. Analysing &amp;quot;Big Data&amp;quot; such as this is seen as a major opportunity in the UK, where it has been recognised to be of national economic and scientific importance (it is one of the UK Government's &amp;quot;8 Great Technologies&amp;quot; of the future that will help drive economic growth). This project lies in the growing EPSRC Research Area of &amp;quot;Statistics and Applied Probability&amp;quot;, but obvious potential impact outside of this field lies in the following themes:

- &amp;quot;Digital Economy&amp;quot;, in aiding understanding of how complex interactions influence society;
- &amp;quot;Global Uncertainties&amp;quot;, in security applications such as locating a terrorist cell in a communication network;
- &amp;quot;Healthcare Technologies&amp;quot;, in helping understand and diagnose diseases such as dementia.

The statistical work in the project also has the potential to lead to impacts in other areas. Again, these are indirect, but are potentially significant. The methodology underlying the algorithms is quite general, and this type of approach may also find use in applications as diverse as weather and climate analysis, genomics and computer vision. The understanding of how the statistical methods used in this project perform is useful to statisticians who work in different areas of application.

The project is ideal for a young researcher to work on, since they will gain skills in two growth areas of national importance: firstly, in the analysis of network data; secondly, in the fields of statistics, machine learning and data science, the subjects at the heart of the &amp;quot;Big Data Revolution&amp;quot;.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99212</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N023927/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
