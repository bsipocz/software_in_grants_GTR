Dirham hoards from Northern Europe, trade in Slavic slaves, and the emergence of Medieval Europe.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K004026/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Perhaps as many as one million dirhams, Islamic silver coins, have been found in hoards across Northern Europe. They travelled thousands of kilometres from the mints of Iraq and Central Asia to the Baltic island of Gotland, other lands around the Baltic and further on to England in the 9th and 10th centuries AD, when long-distance land communications are thought to have been virtually non-existent. The objective of this project is to explain and to evaluate the historical role of this unprecedented flow of silver.

It has so far received little scholarly attention. Even though it is accepted that dirham hoards reflect commercial exchanges between the Islamic world and non-Christian Europe in the 9th and 10th centuries, neither their mechanisms nor their historical significance have been subjected to scrutiny. The project will discuss whether Slavic slaves, rather than furs or forest produce, were the primary commodity sold in return for dirhams. Accounts of Arab geographers and travellers, comparative evidence of other long-distance slave trade systems and the analysis of the silver hoards will allow us to retrace the complex network of suppliers, intermediaries and consumers. We believe that it will be possible to detect archaeological traces, such as abrupt depopulation, that reflect the procurement of slaves.

It is currently unknown why this slave trade system drew to a halt. The answer, we think, will come from a study of the 11th-century trade between Scandinavia and the Slavic lands, evidenced by Anglo-Saxon and German coins which replaced dirhams in the Northern hoards. Does this reflect merely a change in the geography of the demand for slaves? Does it follow that Western European economies of the 11th century relied more heavily than usually thought on slave labour? If yes, the conceptual framework for the emergence of feudalism will need to be reconsidered.

Our study of this slave trade system will require us to address some major gaps in current scholarship. Firstly, we will investigate why the majority of coins hoarded in the Northern Lands was produced in Central Asia by Samanid emirs. Despite its pivotal role in the trade with the North, the Samanid dynasty has never been studied in its own right. We will produce the first scholarly monograph of this dynasty, which will clarify to what extent the Samanids were able to regulate the flow of dirhams to the Northern Lands. We will also explore their role in the collapse of the trade system after ca 950.

Secondly, a significant group of coins known from the Northern hoards has so far almost entirely escaped scholarly attention. These are known as dirham imitations. They represent an untapped historical source of significant potential, but also unusual complexity. They were probably issued by political powers controlling the principal ports of trade, such as the Khazars or the Volga Bulgars; the rationale for their production remains, however, unknown. We think that they hold the key to understanding the economic mechanisms of the slave trade. We will offer, for the first time, a catalogue of their principal types.

Finally, we will reassess the phenomenon of silver hoarding in Northern Europe. A comparative study of the archaeological contexts of hoards in Sweden, Russia and Poland, based on new research in these countries, will detect patterns of hoarding that will, in turn, clarify the reasons for hoarding and for the non-retrieval of the hoards.

These studies will result in a multifaceted picture of the trade system in Slavic slaves. Their implications will go beyond shedding light on an episode of medieval history. The project will substantially contribute to the study of the still neglected phenomenon of European medieval slavery. We will also test our hypothesis that the wealth derived from the sale of Slavic slaves enabled state formation in Northern Europe. If proved, it will offer a new perspective on the formative period of European history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main themes of the project - slave trade, silver hoards, early European contacts with the Islamic world, the emergence of the European states - are likely to stimulate the interest of the wider public, both in the UK and abroad, in Europe and in the Islamic world. They will be relevant to students and teachers at all levels of education, as well as to the general public interested in history in a number of European countries.

We see the main impact of our project in reshaping, in the long run, some of the fundamental assumptions of our vision of the European Middle Ages. Twenty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, very few attempts have been made to present an integrated history of the European continent and to assess mutual influences of the post-Roman world and the remaining part of the continent. The recent ground-breaking study of the origins of the European economy by Michael McCormick - who almost entirely disregarded Scandinavia and the Slavic lands - illustrates the difficulty involved in overcoming this divide. By showing the implications of the large-scale trade in Slavic slaves and the influence of the Islamic world on the formation of states in Northern Europe, this project will promote a more inclusive picture of European history and, as a result, significantly deepen our historical knowledge. It is also likely to elicit reflection on broader topics rooted in this formative period of European history, such as the forging of national identities.

This project will build upon and further stimulate the appetite for the early Middle Ages, and the Viking Age in particular. A major exhibition forthcoming in the British Museum and the fundraising campaigns, recent and planned, for the acquisition of recently discovered Viking-age hoards (Vale of York, Furness and Silverdale) by public museums attest to the continuous interest of the British public for this period. It is significant that, although all the three mentioned hoards contain Islamic dirhams, their presence did not provoke any comments. Our project will provide a coherent explanation for their presence in the British Isles and raise awareness of the complexity of cultural influences that shaped this country. We will also highlight the contribution of the Islamic world to early European history.

We will draw attention to urgent issues connected with the preservation of cultural heritage. Hoards of silver coins are an attractive target for amateur metal detecting. We will raise awareness of the imminent risk of losing unique information on our past by illustrating how contextualized information on dirham hoards can contribute to our knowledge. We will inform the discussions in Central and Eastern European countries aiming at implementing coherent policies towards metal detecting. We will voice our opinion that schemes modelled on the English Portable Antiquities Scheme would greatly contribute to the preservation of the European cultural heritage.

We will communicate the results of our research by means of an exhibition staged in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (described in the Pathways to Impact section). The project's website will allow the public to access project materials such as summaries of the workstreams, maps of hoards and photographs of coins, which can be used in courses on the Viking Age and on the Islamic world in schools and universities.

Our project will strengthen the reputation of British academia, and in particular of the University of Oxford, as the leading research centre with transformational potential in human sciences. The project's international dimension, involving cooperation with Central and Eastern European consultants, will reinforce Oxford's position as a leading forum for sharing ideas in Europe. At a more general level, the project will strengthen international links between the UK and Central and Eastern European countries, where the project is particularly likely to appeal to a wide audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>484276</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The exhibition (created by Treadwell and Jankowiak) consisted of a display of Viking-Age silver coinage and accompanying text panels (Coin hoards as evidence of trade and Islamic dirhams and imitational dirhams).

Our research will serve to remind the general public that the fate of the Islamic world has been intimately connected with the fate of Europe over the past millennium, in ways that have been integral to the development of Islamic civilisation as well as Europe. The material we are researching consists of a huge quantity of Islamic silver coinage that flowed northwestwards in the 10th century CE, from eastern Iran and western Central Asia along trade routes which linked the Middle East with European Russia, the Baltic states, Scandinavia and the British Isles. These coins were exchanged for raw materials (amber, fur, metalwork) and slaves that were imported into the Islamic world. The silver wealth that accumulated in Europe as a result of this trade was instrumental in stimulating early state formation and planting the seeds of political configurations that are still recognisable in today's world. Our research constitutes a timely reminder that the histories of Europe and the Islamic world have been closely linked for centuries, beginning at a time when the Islamic world nurtured the most prosperous, creative and knowledge-based societies in the world.

Our project has been instrumental in raising issues of heritage management in Sweden, which is where our most significant investment in collaborative research is located. As a result of the experience we have already accumulated with the national museum service and the archaeological community in Sweden, we have been consulted by senior figures in the Swedish academy for our views on the future trajectory of archaeological research in Viking-Age sites and the best procedures for efficient processing of the coin finds that constitute the most important evidence for the Viking-Age era of Sweden. We have been able to draw on our experience of the highly successful track record of the Portable Antiquities Scheme in this country to suggest modifications to current practices in Sweden that will facilitate the efficient attribution, conservation, curation and display of coin finds.

Public dissemination of our project's impact is now under way. The Dirhams for Slaves website, hosted by the Khalili Research Centre, Oxford University, went live in the summer of 2014 and provides information on news and events connected to the project team's activities. An exhibition on Viking-Age hoards and coinage in the Ashmolean Museum (Jul-Sep 2015) brought our project to the attention of general public, as did several publications in press and on popular websites. We have organised a number of conferences in Oxford and in Stockholm, and given talks in the UK, Norway, Sweden, Poland, and Russia. The project contributed to the awareness of the importance of slave trade in the Viking World and in general in the early middle ages, thus adding a new important dimension to the perceptions of this period. This new understanding of the Vikings finds its way to a general public, as proved by a feature article on the Vikings in the March 2017 issue of &amp;quot;National Geographic&amp;quot;, for which M Jankowiak was interviewed, and where the results of the project are referred to.</gtr:description><gtr:id>384DF939-9FDE-41D3-8031-758942FF39EE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546288bf3af480.77151309</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project consists of several work strands, each of which has already developed ideas that expand our understanding of the early medieval world. 

1) Imitational coinage. We have gathered data on Viking-Age imitational coins from a wide range of sources, including hard-to-access printed sources and coin collections above all from the Royal Coin Cabinet in Stockholm. This data has been used to populate a database of imitational coinages which comprises c.10,000 entries. This material is of extreme complexity: the coins cannot be categorized according to classical criteria (mint, date, issuing authority) because they do not carry this information. We have developed a sophisticated methodology that will allow us to establish a typology of these coins, upon which our printed and online catalogue of dirham imitations, one of the major outcomes of the project, will be based. In order to better understand this material we convened a major conference on early medieval imitative coinages in the Royal Coin Cabinet in Stockholm in November 2015. We are reaching a good understanding of why imitations were being produced. They were a key instrument for maintaining trade, especially the slave trade, between the Islamic world and Scandinavia/Slavic lands. This confirms our initial assumption that the establishment of their typology and chronology will transform our understanding of the mechanisms and chronology of trade. 

2) Early medieval slave trade. We have developed our understanding of the early medieval slavery in all the cultural areas concerned by the project (Islamic world, Scandinavia, Slavic lands, Hungary, Byzantium), and of the slave trade between them. Conclusions will be summarized in a monograph in preparation by M Jankowiak. His contribution to the understanding of early medieval slavery has been recognised by the editors of the Cambridge World History of Slavery, who invited him to comment on the medieval volume of the series. 

3) Silver hoards. J Gruszczynski has developed a methodology to understand the spatial distribution of silver hoards in northern Europe, in particular on the Baltic island of Gotland. The central question is the relation of the hoards to settlement patterns. Even if the latter are still insufficiently well-known, the working hypothesis is that not all hoards were directly related to settlements, and some of them may have played a more symbolic role, e.g. as markers of boundaries. This conclusion was supported by Gotlandic archaeologists, with whom we discussed the question at a workshop in Oxford in March 2015. Gotland is the key to understanding Viking-Age monetary circulation in Scandinavia: we are now in a position to address the complexities of the issue and drive the subject forward. In January 2017 Jacek Gruszczynski was awarded his doctorate for his thesis entitled 'A comparative study of archaeological contexts of silver hoards c. 800-1050 in Northern and Central Europe'. His examiners noted that the thesis was 'of exceptional quality' and had dramatically altered the scholarly understanding of silver deposition and shaken up their conception of the ways and means by which silver circulated in the Viking Age. They concluded that 'nobody interested in the silver economies of the Viking Age can afford not to engage with Gruszyzynski's fascinating and important thesis, which should set the pace on the subject for some time to come' and urged that the thesis should be published 'as soon as possible.

4) Samanids. Monograph currently in preparation by L Treadwell. The monograph will comprise a history of the dynasty from its previously unknown beginnings in the early 9th c. (now reconstructed largely on the basis of numismatic evidence) to its collapse at the end of the 10th c. when the Turkish Qarakhanid confederation conquered Transoxania. The study will include the religious, economic and political history of the dynasty, with the aim of showing how the southern terminus of the trade route studied by the project operated. The monetary and economy history of the dynasty, depending in part on research undertaken by project members on silver hoards and mint output, will play an important role in explicating the trajectory of the dynasty's political history.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>After completion of the second year of this three-year project, our preliminary findings were widely communicated to our colleagues in Oxford; they have been communicated to a broader academic audience at conferences and seminars in the UK (Leeds, St Andrews, London) and abroad (Oslo, Stockholm, Krakow, soon Princeton), and started to filter outwards to mass media. The view that the slave trade was a key driver behind the emergence of a new map of Europe in the 10th c. has gained some popularity in recent years, but has never been substantiated. Our project is, to our knowledge, the only project in Europe that deals with this question systematically. Its importance for historical science in general cannot thus be overestimated. In the course of our work we have come across a number of issues that may be of interest to broader constituencies. For example, we have identified several issues related to heritage management in Sweden. In our view, the current restrictive approach to amateur archaeology is detrimental to the preservation of Swedish cultural heritage, esp. hoards of precious metals. We hope to influence Swedish decision-makers to evolve towards a scheme modelled on the English Portable Antiquities Scheme. Also we have found that arrangements for the conservation of archaeological objects deter archaeologists from retrieving every-day objects from the ground and thus skew the archaeological record towards high-quality luxury objects, perpetuating a distorted image of Viking-Age material culture. Furthermore, the project is helping to encourage discussion in European academic circles of the importance of slavery and slave trade in early medieval Europe. Traditionally thought to correspond to the &amp;quot;ancient mode of production&amp;quot;, slavery was until recently considered to be untypical for the early middle ages. Our research has begun to undermine this position by demonstrating the crucial role the slave trade played in the emergence of state structures in Northern Europe. This has implications on how historians and archaeologists interpret their findings. We tried to attract the attention of the latter to the necessity of including slavery in their interpretative frameworks at the very well-attended session on the 'Archaeology of early medieval slavery' at the Annual Meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists in Istanbul in September 2014. The publication of the papers delivere in that session of the EAA are in the process of being published by Jankowiak and his co-editor.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8BDCEBAC-6080-45FC-8241-E67099B49B88</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54639a5431c0b6.43604133</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/dirhamsforslaves/index.php/en/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Jacek Gruszczynski has developed a methodology for analyzing spatial data related to Viking-Age finds of hoards of silver in northern Europe.

These are the reasons why no other researchers have yet attempted to produce a catalogue of this material - our initiative is the first of its kind in the sixty-year history of research on this topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a526081b763.91429148</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dirham Imitations Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a working database collecting data on the finds of silver coins and objects in the Baltic area and in the Slavic lands.
