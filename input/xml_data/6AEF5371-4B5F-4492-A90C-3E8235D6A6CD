One way in which these can be relayed inside of cells is by using the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. This pathway is important for the well-being of an individual, whether in development, in maintenance or in response to infection. However, in many diseases its adventitious activation has been implicated in the primary cause or the resulting symptoms. However, even though this pathway has been extensively studied there are gaps in our understanding. Unlike other signalling pathways, little research has been done using the fruit fly to study this pathway. The fly has 60-70% of all known human disease containing genes, many of which were first isolated in the fly, and has been of major importance in understanding the principles of signalling pathways. My research will help in the basic understanding of how the JAK/STAT pathway is activated and will also find which genes may be the cause of abnormal pathway activation. The new genes that I will identify will be of benefit to human health as they could be potential targets for drugs and gene therapy in controlling diseases caused by the JAK/STAT pathway</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The JAK/STAT pathway plays important roles in development and disease and is conserved between phyla. However, unlike other signalling pathways Drosophila has not been the driving force behind its characterisation, mainly due to its medical importance and it is here that mammalian research has forged ahead. Since the discovery of the pathway, few new components have been found, with the exception of a few key players. I will use Drosophila to identify new components of the pathway and to characterise the novel role that receptor dimerisation plays in signalling competence. 
I have identified a ligand-independent regulation step in the control JAK/STAT receptor homo-dimerisation. Only cells with pre-formed dimers are competent to signal, thus the isolation of new proteins regulating this is of fundamental importance. I have developed a screen to search for these proteins and aim to isolate genes controlling this and characterise them.
To complement this work I also plan to identify new components of the JAK/STAT pathway using sensitised genetic screens and yeast two hybridisation screens. The genetic screens can be split into embryonic deficiency and adult chemically mutagenised F1 screens. In another screen in the adult I will use sensitised enhancer and supressor genetic modifier screens which will rely upon using either dominant negative receptor or the overexpression of the ligand. In the second part of the project, a yeast two hybrid screen will be completed with JAK, STAT and receptor as baits. Six interesting clones have been isolated so far from the preliminary study of the yeast two hybrid screen, with the JAK and receptor. Genes isolated from all of these methods will be knocked out and characterised with respect to development and function in signalling. These screens should uncover overlapping new JAK/STAT pathway members, and will produce results and mutants of benefit in the final comprehensive analysis of each gene. 
This project is of medical and scientific importance because it can identify genes that control receptor signalling competence and identify genes that are required for general functions of JAK/STAT signalling. STAT is an oncogene and the JAK/STAT pathway has been shown to be required pleiotropically throughout a human life cycle. The JAK/STAT pathway is still is poorly understood compared to other signalling pathways, which have been extensively studied in this organism. A Drosophila approach will enable the mass screening for genes in this pathway.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-10-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2004-10-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>431923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Life Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Tribolium Olfactory Genomics</gtr:description><gtr:id>4B9D6554-B70C-4C7C-B488-0AD5B4D91DC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has produced one published paper with one remaining unpublished.
