The research of this project will cover both numerical simulation and analytical derivation of the approximated solutions based on extending the Kirchhoff approximation technique to the case of rough surface containing multiple scales. This will be used to develop a technique of recovering water surface profile based on the data recorded on array of microphones. The method will provide sub-millimetre accuracy required to identify various scales of gravity-capillary waves present on the surface of shallow water flow. This information can potentially be linked to underwater conditions and flow velocity profile. 

The project outcomes will provide a virtual environment to prove the concept of non-invasive measurements as well as a tool to interpret the collected data. The numerical simulations will be adapted to open source software (i.e. GNU Octave and Scilab). For dissemination of the results and further developments, the software will be realised to acoustic and hydraulic communities as open source. 

The key novelty of this project is that the proposed method will be able to work reliably with a broad range of flows typically found in rivers, estuaries and partially filled pipes (sewers), which are the key components of water infrastructure and are critical in the water circulation process. This work will enable the development of non-invasive instrumentation which can determine flow rates and sediment transport in natural and man-made channels. This will enhance our capability for flood risk assessment and pollution monitoring.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-invasive monitoring technique of the water systems will be the main impact of this project. The project is directly linked to the research and development of low-cost low-maintenance acoustic wave probes conducted by Pennine Water Group at the University of Sheffield. The results of these developments will shape technology for a follow-on spin-off commercial project that has the potential to revolutionize the way the water infrastructure is managed through the considerable improvement in the quality of data. The technology will benefit multiple stakeholders and will be used in various applications. The list of potential beneficiaries includes business, industry and local authorities. Currently, there is no experimental system which is able to measure with sub-millimetre accuracy the instantaneous variation of the free surface of intermediate/shallow water flow, particularly in-situ. The technology I propose to develop will dramatically improve the resolution and accuracy of these measurements. This project will provide a technique of analysing acoustic data and linking these analytically with temporal and spatial variability of the dynamic water surface. The results of this work can be of use in research and development projects which are sponsored by the industrial partners to improve the accuracy of the flow measuring devices. The results can also be used within university laboratories to investigate various parameters of the water flow (i.e. flow rate, Reynolds number) and their link to underwater conditions (i.e. condition of the flow bed, water pollution).

The monitoring systems based on the airborne acoustic measurement principle can be installed in sewerage pipes and over rivers/channels to monitor the dynamics of the water flow continuously and with high accuracy. This will enable the water industry to know in advance any potentially critical changes in the monitored system. As well as providing the water industry with continuous monitoring, this technology can also be linked to the insurance companies and help to improve the risk analysis associated with infrastructure deterioration rates and floods. It is suggested that the continuous monitoring technique of the water systems may result in reduced insurance cost for households situated within flooding risk area. Local authorities can benefit from the data that this monitoring technology can provide in terms of improved planning of developments and correctly assessing the need in investments in the local water infrastructure.

A main knowledge impact of this project will be realised in the form of a virtual modelling environment which will enable stakeholders to analyse the way their flow metering devices operate under various flow conditions, to improve the accuracy of the currently used experimental and monitoring techniques, and to inform future development of the monitoring techniques for water systems. The existence of this software will also provide people with advanced skills in developing the acoustic probes. Part of the software will be used to develop a mobile app for smartphones that will illustrate the potentials of the technology and enable wide public engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100019</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E902B4BD-F48F-4F7F-B65C-FA69D44E818D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Doppler spectra of airborne sound backscattered by the free surface of a shallow turbulent water flow.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/da1392aeeba03481f8e5eb9001c53dc2"><gtr:id>da1392aeeba03481f8e5eb9001c53dc2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dolcetti G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-4966</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa2bcab28b0d5.81920178</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>585A0ABC-AADC-490A-9B4A-AD776DE94756</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reconstruction of the dynamic surface roughness with acoustic imaging technique</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/da1392aeeba03481f8e5eb9001c53dc2"><gtr:id>da1392aeeba03481f8e5eb9001c53dc2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dolcetti G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa2be074af964.64958480</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FF5803A8-3635-46C0-870A-6EE5796CD0D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Doppler spectra of airborne ultrasound forward scattered by the rough surface of open channel turbulent water flows.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/da1392aeeba03481f8e5eb9001c53dc2"><gtr:id>da1392aeeba03481f8e5eb9001c53dc2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dolcetti G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-4966</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa2b9adf29060.77171216</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N029437/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B148AA4C-48F9-4B18-90F6-641750F725A1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Acoustics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
