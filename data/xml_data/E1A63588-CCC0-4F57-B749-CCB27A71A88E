It plays a major role in all aspects from isolation and characterization of natural products with potential pharmacological activity, to the synthesis of libraries of compounds such as small molecules, natural products and their derivatives to be tested for the treatment of diseases. However, despite the many advances, this science is still limited in its ability to reproduce most of the complex biological compounds with interesting medicinal activities that can be found in Nature. In general, laboratory syntheses of these natural products represent enormous efforts requiring multiple steps yielding often just a few milligrams of the precious compound. These syntheses generally cannot be implemented in industry, since the production of usable amounts of material would require far too many resources, resulting in prohibitive costs. Thus, organic synthesis still has a long way to go to be able to facilitate the preparation of complex molecules that could result in better, more selective and efficient, medicines. A methodology commonly used in synthesis is called cross-coupling, and consist in the coupling of two small molecules to form a bigger one. To be able to perform a cross-coupling, both molecules need to be functionalized in the positions to be joined. This means that special chemical groups (metals and halogens) have to be introduced in each of the molecules, which often results in the addition of several steps of synthesis. In addition, these groups are lost at the end of the cross-coupling reaction generating (sometimes toxic) metal containing waste products.To address these problems, C-H activation methodologies are being developed nowadays as a tool that can allow the cross-coupling of two molecules without the need for one or both of them to be functionalized. It works by using a catalyst that can activate a C-H bond in the molecule during the cross-coupling reaction. Catalysts are molecules that can promote other molecules to undergo reactions, and very small amounts are necessary. The research in this proposal aims at developing a general methodology for C-H arylation. For this, a whole new type of catalysts will be designed and prepared. In this methodology the use of the metal as an activating group in one of the molecules will be avoided, therefore reducing the problem of the generation of toxic waste metals to the generation of a simple hydrogen atom. In addition, the methodology will be able to work at convenient temperatures (25 oC) instead of the usual high temperatures (140 oC) employed. This is important to ensure that the methodology is compatible with as many substrates as possible, avoiding side reactions. The successful completion of this research will provide powerful tools for chemists to use in the synthesis of medicines, materials and other compounds.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>305711</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1250000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Make it Simple</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>MakeItSimple</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>03CBC388-3320-44B4-9905-12AAA0D1AC59</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8550739296.29357406a1179c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>321006</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Metal Catalyzed Decarboxylative C-C Bond Forming Reactions</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/I038578/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6A1160E0-9885-40CE-BE6D-061F73418A40</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5eda99ec5eda9a00</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We demonstrated for the first time that silver is able to catalyze the decarboxylation of benzoic acids in milder conditions than previous copper based methods. This results have been taken over by many research groups in the world and used to develop an enormous array of different decarboxylative transformations. Proof of this is the exceptionally high rate of citations for our two seminal publications in Organic Letters: nearly 300 combined citations since publication in 2009 where our methodology is used or further expanded. Due to the distributed nature of development of scientific discoveries it is difficult to pinpoint a particular example of direct impact. However, the incipient use of decarboxylative transformations in industrial settings for the manufacture of chemicals will have partially benefited by our research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1FCBD96D-2712-4C32-8871-36B9594F625F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-8442345865.482786de24face</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has resulted in findings in two separated areas; the first one directly related to the initial aims of the project; the second one resulted from a serendipitous discovery during the main work. 
Key findings within initial aims: 1) We have discovered that gold(I) salts are able to perform extremely selective C-H activation reactions on electron-poor arenes, even in the presence of electron-rich arenes. 2) We have discovered that the resulting aryl-gold(I) complexes can be oxidised to gold(III) complexes. 3) The new gold(III) complexes are able to perform extremely selective C-H activation reactions on electron-rich arenes (even in the presence of electron-poor ones), which is immediately followed by a reductive process forming a C-C bond between the two arenes and regenerating the initial gold(I). 4) The overall outcome of this transformation is that two different aromatic compounds can be forced to react with each other in a selective fashion. (previous attempts at this coupling, key for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and organic electronic materials involve previous treatment of the arenes requiring several chemical transformations and the generation of significant amounts of waste -- our process has the potential to become an environmentally friendly versatile approach to these materials) 
Key findings resulting from a serendipitous discovery: 5) During this work we have discovered that silver(I) salts are able to catalyze the decarboxylation of benzoic acids and heteroaromatic carboxylic acids. 6) This decarboxylative activation occurs at lower temperatures than the more commonly used Cu-catalyzed one. 7) Several synthetic methodologies for the decarboxylative functionalization of benzoic acids have been developed over the past few years as a result of this discovery.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings could be used to develop completely catalytic in gold oxidative cross-coupling of aromatics. These have a number of advantages over competing systems, but in particular, higher atom economy. These new methods could be used by anyone looking to synthesise particular biaryl structures from simple readily available sources.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8ED12143-DAA9-43CD-B976-22487474E1DC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3229753219.7365103774d40ec</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9ED398E1-DF5B-4F60-AF5D-ECEB82A6B5B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Silver-catalyzed protodecarboxylation of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/641b7b9a7f98659c62542ab595f28b37"><gtr:id>641b7b9a7f98659c62542ab595f28b37</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lu P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1523-7052</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d01c01c3718d8e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A26083D-49AF-4F5D-AB70-B7771644A18E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Redox-controlled selectivity of C-H activation in the oxidative cross-coupling of arenes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/74d94b6910fde50a9494e133420bec4a"><gtr:id>74d94b6910fde50a9494e133420bec4a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cambeiro XC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfc1fc19c9bdd4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A2C9DB24-E670-427D-93E2-DB70DD3767F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intermolecular decarboxylative direct C-3 arylation of indoles with benzoic acids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6762d34a72542383404f82df02b7e864"><gtr:id>6762d34a72542383404f82df02b7e864</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cornella J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1523-7052</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d01c01c367f362</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6605B1A5-942C-4A9A-BC80-45CCEE7EF653</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Novel Mode of Reactivity for Gold(I): The Decarboxylative Activation of (Hetero)Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advanced Synthesis &amp;
