The behavior that we will study is one that jays do for a living, namely hiding food for future consumption and relying on memory to find hidden stashes at a later date ('food-caching'). From a welfare perspective, there is increasing interest in using cognitive enrichment for captive animals (i.e. providing them with tasks that are mentally challenging), but there is a lack of scientific evidence as to whether and how cognitive activities are rewarding to animals per se. The proposed studies directly address this issue by investigating what aspects of caching behaviour the jays are most motivated to perform (i.e. the jays value the most), and how these decisions are influenced by the cognitive attributes of the behaviours, such as the jays' knowledge of the likelihood of successful recovery, and the bird's current or anticipated motivational state. To address these issues, we shall develop a decision paradigm for the jays in which the choice between two perches determines access to one of two cages. The jays will be given a choice between differing numbers of cache locations in these cages to find out whether their preference for the opportunity to cache is enhanced by how hungry they are, and whether the value they place on caching also depends on whether or not they have been prevented from caching either recently, or over longer time periods. We shall also investigate whether the birds' choices are also modulated by what happens when they come to recover their caches. This is important because in order for the recovery conditions to affect the jays' caching preferences, the birds must anticipate these conditions on the basis of their past experience of recovering their caches. To test this idea, we shall determine whether or not jays assign a higher value to caching in places from which they have the opportunity to recover and whether they assign a lower value to caching a type of food that has previously been stolen or has become spoiled. We shall also ask whether the opportunity to cache is affected by their feeding motivation at the time when they cache or when they come to recover the caches, and whether they value caching in private more than when others jays are present who could witness the caching event and therefore pose a threat to their caches. Taken together these experiments will provide important information about the caching decisions that jays make and the extent to which these decisions are influenced by cognitive and motivational factors. It will thus reveal how rewarding performance of this natural behavior is under different motivational and cognitive conditions that influence the outcome of caching behavior. By providing new information about the value of performing a cognitively demanding task, the project will allow us to investigate the rationale and potential for using 'cognitive enrichment' in welfare enhancement programmes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>To assess the incentive value of caching and its modulation by motivational and cognitive processes, we shall develop a decision paradigm for jays in which the choice between two perches determines access to one of two goal cages on a concurrent variable interval schedule. Having validated this paradigm by varying the amount of food in each goal cage, jays will be given a choice between differing numbers of cache locations in these cages to investigate whether the preference for the opportunity to cache is enhanced by general and specific states of hunger and whether short- and long term deprivation of caching potentiates the incentive value of caching. Evidence for the role of cognition will come from studies on the impact of the conditions at recovery upon caching decisions. In order for the recovery conditions to affect caching, the birds must anticipate these conditions on the basis of their past experience of cache recovery. Initially, we shall determine whether or not jays assign a higher incentive value to caching in locations from which they then have an opportunity to recover and if so, whether jays devalue the opportunity to cache a specific food if it has been pilfered or degraded. Perhaps the most compelling evidence that caching involves prospective cognition comes from the discovery that it is the motivational state at recovery, rather than at caching, that is the primary determinant of caching decisions. By pre-feeding different foods at the time of caching and recovery, we shall determine whether the incentive value of the opportunity to cache is affected by the relevance of the food available for caching to the anticipated motivational state at recovery, which would provide good evidence that the rewarding properties of food-caching is modulated by cognitive processes. Finally, we shall assess the role of social cognition, namely whether the jays avoid caching in locations in which they can be observed, as opposed to cached in private.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>By assessing the motivation for engaging in a natural and cognitively demanding behaviour, namely food-caching by jays, the proposed programme of research will have a direct impact upon animal welfare, a subject that is high on the public priority list. Furthermore by providing important information about the environmental needs of corvids, this research addresses critical issues in the 'Refinement' component of the 3Rs, which also has implications for legislative bodies responsible for animal welfare. Indeed it is listed under two of the BBSRC strategic policy priorities, namely (a) the 3Rs in research using animals and (b) animal welfare. Furthermore, corvids are treated as vermin or agricultural pests. Our work should affect how policy makers and the public perceive corvids, and their physical and social needs. It is therefore essential that our work receives the appropriate media attention, and the PI and co-PI will use their past experience of doing so to ensure that this will happen. Indeed our previous work has been featured on TV, radio, popular pieces in the press, and public debates. The work on corvids in general, and food caching jays in particular was also used to inspire the choreography of Rambert Dance Company's 'The Comedy Of Change', and a film 'Brainy Birds' is available at http://www.rambert.org.uk/comedy_of_change/videos. It was also chosen by Cambridge's 800th campaign as one of seven research programmes to profile: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_MnwNyX0Ds. Academically, our proposed research programme should have an important impact on our understanding not only of animal welfare but also more generally on animal decision-making and preference. In the laboratory animals are typically faced with decisions between different amounts, probabilities or delay of resources. However what has not been previously studied are decisions between resources whose values are modulated by cognitive processes such as episodic-like memory and future planning. In this respect the present studies should make an important novel contribution to our understanding of the processes that determine an animal's preferences and decisions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>404040</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In the making of a BBC2 documentary about animal intelligence called Inside The Animal Mind</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>05C5379D-E2C5-4D70-B65E-21C9D99F0003</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545a477e617635.92206655</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this grant we investigated two natural behaviours displayed by Eurasian jays, namely caching and food-sharing. For both behaviours, we assessed the interplay between motivational and cognitive factors influencing the jays' decision to perform the behaviours. We did this by investigating whether the frequency of behaviours was stable across different testing conditions in which the desires of the individuals involved were manipulated and by investigating whether and how the food cached of shared was affected by the manipulation of the desires of the individuals involved. 

CACHING: 

- By manipulating the desire state of jays by sating them on a particular food (a procedure known as specific satiety), we have shown that observing jays pilfer caches they have seen other others make according to their current desire state, such that cachers might benefit from taking an observer's current desire into account when attempting to protecting their caches from being pilfered. 

- After seeing an observing jay being sated on one food, cachers selectively protected those caches that were at risk of being pilfered by preferentially caching food that the observer was sated on.

- We found that the cacher's ability to respond to the observer's current desire seems to be based on the observer's behaviour during the caching event itself. Therefore, this particular cache-protection strategy might not require complex cognitive skills such as desire-state attribution.

- Although the observer's current desire affected the type of food cached by caching jays, it did not affect the total number of cached made. This finding suggests that the caching behaviour might have a stable incentive value for the jays, which is not affected by cognitive decisions. 

FOOD-SHARING

- We investigated whether the female Eurasian jay's current desire influences the number of food items shared with the female as well as the type of food shared with the female. Our results showed that the number of food items shared did not differ depending on what food the female was currently sated on and therefore did not desire but that the male preferentially shared the type of food that the female was not sated on and was thus still desired by the female. These findings suggest that firstly, food-sharing has a stable incentive value for Eurasian jays and secondly, that the male might be able to ascribe a desire state to his female partner. 

- In a series of experiments we investigated how the male's own motivational state influences his food-sharing behaviour. We found that when the male's desire conflicted that of the female, the male's food-sharing decision takes into account both. These finding shows that the male displays an egoistic bias, similarly to what has previously been found with both human children and adults.

- A high flexibility of the male's food-sharing decisions was found in a set of experiments manipulating different cues given to the male. Here we found that when males saw the female eat one type of food to satiety, they fed her the 'correct' food, i.e. the food that the female was not sated on and that after they saw the female choose one item of a certain food type out of a choice of two food types, the males attributed a preference to the female, i.e. fed her the same type of food that they had seen her eat. These findings show that the males do not react rigidly to seeing the female perform the same action - in this case eating food - but take into account the whole context in which this action is performed. In addition, we found that males fed the female the 'correct' food also after seeing her ignore the food that was given to her, i.e. they preferentially fed her a different food.

- The results from a series of inference-based experiments support the hypothesis that the male's ability to cater for the female's specific satiety is based on desire-state attribution. In these experiments, we ruled out the possibility that the males might be responding solely on the basis of the female's overt behaviours. Instead, the males seem to have inferred the female's decreased desire for food that she was sated on. In addition, we found that the males' inference of the female's desire interacted with the female's overt behaviour when both types of cues conveyed conflicting information, suggesting that the males' food-sharing decisions rely on both types of processes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>BBC2 Inside The Animal Mind made a three-episode series on animal intelligence for which Clayton was the super contributor.
