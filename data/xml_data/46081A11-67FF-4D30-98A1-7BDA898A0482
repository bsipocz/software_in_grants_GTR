The same is not true for transport poverty and economic stress, which are currently under researched. This is despite transport costs being an increasingly significant item of household expenditure, and a major cause of public concern in the UK - notably for low income car-owning households, who spend 31% of their income on transport. 
The project will develop the concept of transport poverty, exploring its relationships with housing and fuel poverty, and implications for energy demand reduction and social justice. It will develop connections between the British academic and policy debate and similar debates abroad, where issues of increasing transport costs and vulnerability to oil price spikes have been framed in terms of sustainable spatial development, highlighting the interlinkages between transport and housing affordability. 
The following research questions will guide the study:
1. What are the systematic patterns of transport poverty and economic stress in the UK, in terms of socio-demographics, geographic distribution and relationships with housing and fuel poverty? 
2. What do these patterns suggest for the distributional and total demand implications of energy demand reduction policies and scenarios for the UK? 
The project has been designed to have a symbiotic relationship with other on-going work on qualitative understandings of transport needs and affordability within the DEMAND Centre (www.demand.ac.uk). It will inform DEMAND's work with hard figures on transport poverty and economic stress, while at the same time using their qualitative findings to inform a critical discussion of existing data sets and to orientate the quantitative analysis.
A set of 5 interdependent workpackages, mostly consisting of secondary quantitative analysis, will span 18 months. The specific goals are: 
1. to conceptualise the relationships between transport, housing and fuel poverty in an interdisciplinary and international perspective, based on an international literature review 
2. to explore patterns of transport spending and its relationship with spending on housing and domestic energy in the UK, by analysing recent family expenditure data (Living Costs and Food Survey 2012)
3. to explore material deprivation and economic stress in low-income car owning households in the UK and the EU, based on the EU-SILC dataset
4. to explore more geographically detailed patterns of transport poverty for a metropolitan area characterised by high levels of deprivation, by analysing the Merseyside Travel Poverty Survey
5. to exploit MOT Tests and Results Data to understand the potential role of technological lags for lower income groups in aggravating transport poverty and economic stress, and to produce UK-wide maps of the fuel-related economic stress and oil vulnerability of car users
The project aims to challenge the current &amp;quot;silo&amp;quot; approach of policy making, in which issues of transport, housing and fuel poverty are seen as separate. A series of written outputs (publicly available working paper and report, policy briefing) and public engagement events (2-day international interdisciplinary workshop and final dissemination event) will aim to highlight the significance of transport poverty and to bring together a cross-sectoral audience of stakeholders, with potential impacts in terms of cross-fertilization and knowledge sharing. The ambition is to contribute to the development of innovative cross-sectoral policies, along the lines of measures experimented abroad (e.g. location efficient mortgages, mobility-efficiency certificates for building, online tools for calculating the mobility costs of residential relocation).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will add new understandings of cross sectoral, energy-related economic stress. By highlighting the distributional implications of energy demand reduction policies, which limit their public acceptability, it is of relevance to evidence-based policy making at a range of levels and departments, not least to DfT and DECC. By considering the interaction of transport and fuel poverty with housing affordability, it will also generate findings of interest to DCLG.
At the level of local authorities, the knowledge produced will benefit Integrated Transport Authorities and Passenger Transport Executives. The project will identify areas where economic stress is intensive, potentially informing the planning of subsidised public transport services. Therefore, efforts will be made to engage with the Passenger Transport Executive Group, Merseytravel and Transport for London (already a partner in DEMAND). The project will capitalise on other work in DEMAND on prices and justice, which is focussed on the engagement of stakeholders and transport policy makers at the local and national level, to enhance its economic and societal impact. The project will also add to the tools that the MOT project is developing for local authorities to evaluate policy interventions, by enriching the datasets with indicators of economic stress that allow a longitudinal 'tracking' of the distributional impacts of policies. 
By adopting an international perspective, the project aims to arouse interest of policy makers for measures adopted abroad to reduce the transport expenditure of households. These include e.g. Location Efficient Mortgages (US) and online tools for calculating the mobility costs of residential relocation (Germany, Austria). While it is not always possible to import policies, this might contribute to the development of effective measures in the UK. This maps onto DEMAND'S priority of exploring the international experience of the governance of energy demand reduction. The analysis of an EU-level dataset on living conditions will allow comparison of the UK with other countries, generating findings of interest to policy communities in the EU. 
Beyond policy-making, the project will benefit to a range of non-governmental organisations with interests in sustainable development and/or poverty and affordability, in the transport sector and beyond (e.g. Sustrans, Campaign for Better Transport, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, RAC Foundation). By showing which social groups and neighbourhoods struggle the most with the costs of motoring, the project will be of interest to public transport operators looking to expand their services. 
The embedding of the project within DEMAND will ensure close cooperation with EDF R&amp;amp;D, which has an established interest in fuel poverty and will increase the project's non academic impact. Also, the project will benefit from DEMAND's stakeholder mapping exercise, which has set the goal to interact with over 150 stakeholders from the fields of energy, local planning and more. 
By exploring the links between low fuel vehicle efficiency and transport poverty among low income households, the project will be of relevance to organisations such as the the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership, informing their scenarios with social justice considerations. 
Finally, engaging with the research communities working on housing affordability and fuel poverty will result in increased awareness of issues of transport poverty and economic stress, with cascading effects on the public awareness and understanding of this burning social issue, as well as on the design of future data collection exercises. 
Overall, in the longer term, an improved understanding of economic stress in the transport sector will benefit wider society (including, crucially, future generations) in terms of increased resilience to oil price shocks, which is essential if the UK is to maintain economic competitiveness, social welfare and cohesion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142904</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Lyon</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics de l'Etat</gtr:department><gtr:description>Memorandum of Understanding between LET Lyon and ITS Leeds for research and student exchange activities</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5CCE09E-5D51-42F5-B996-4DDB602A2EBD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are no outputs or outcomes so far apart from the drafting of a MoU which is due to be signed soon.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56162e258ceb31.53533654-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The &amp;quot;Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics de l'Etat&amp;quot; at University of Lyon (France) proposed the signing of a MoU between the two institutions and contributed to the drafting of the MoU</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A Memorandum of Understanding is in the process of being signed between the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds and the &amp;quot;Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics de l'Etat&amp;quot; at University of Lyon (France).

The aim of the workshop was to make connections between issues of affordability in different areas (transport, housing and domestic energy) and how these have been conceptualised (or not) in three different EU countries (UK, France and Germany), while at the same time bringing together academic and policy perspectives. Over two intensive days we have discussed topics such as: transport-related economic stress among motorised lower-middle classes; the poor resilience and oil vulnerability of suburban and remote areas; urban households who cannot afford car ownership; the coping strategies of households and policy makers in the face of rising fuel and housing costs; how to develop a comprehensive approach to (transport and domestic) energy poverty; the definition and measurement of 'transport poverty'.

The multinational literature review highlights the lack of connections being made in British research and policy-making between questions of affordability in the fields of housing, domestic energy and transport. This contrasts with the situation in France and Germany, where these connections are increasingly being made. On the other hand, the British debate on affordability has been dominated by an analogy between fuel poverty and &amp;quot;transport poverty&amp;quot; - which is assumed to be the transport equivalent of fuel poverty. Our work has highlighted a number of similarities and differences between the two issues, with important implications for how transport poverty is to be conceptualised, measured and tackled. 
Work package 2. We have used Living Costs and Food Survey to develop a metric of &amp;quot;car-related economic stress&amp;quot; that is inspired by the &amp;quot;Low-Income-High-Cost&amp;quot; indicator of fuel poverty currently adopted by the English government. The results show that 9% of households (approximately 2.3 million) in Great Britain have low income and high running motor vehicles cost. Households with children, the 'working poor', and home owners are particularly likely to belong to this group. The incidence and the intensity of economic stress have worsened between 2006 and 2012, as motor fuel prices increased and in the wake of the economic crisis. LIHC households with low income and high motoring costs have lower price elasticity of fuel demand, i.e. they are less able to reduce consumption in response to price increases. This makes them more vulnerable to oil price market fluctuations and policy-driven tax increases. 
Work package 3. We have used EU-SILC data to develop a material-deprivation-based measure of &amp;quot;car-related economic stress&amp;quot;. Approximately 7% of the population of Great Britain (1.7 million) own a car despite being in &amp;quot;material deprivation&amp;quot;. These are more likely to be working poor, households with children, living in thinly populated areas. These households tend to experience affordability problems in more than one area (car-related economic stress, housing cost overburden, fuel poverty), to curtail social activities and domestic energy consumption, and to be in debt. 
Work package 5. We have used vehicle inspection (MOT) data, income data and accessibility statistics to develop a spatial indicator of vulnerability to fuel price increases in England. The methodology developed improves and extends previous international studies on 'oil vulnerability'. The findings show a divide at the national level between London and surrounding areas (low vulnerability as a result of high income and good public transport service) and a variety of suburban, peri-urban and rural areas in the rest of the country (highly vulnerable because of low income, high car dependence, or both). Unlike other international studies, however, we do not find a 'regressive' correlation between poverty and car dependence at the metropolitan level.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have already been shown to be of interest to government officials in housing, land-use, energy and transport. The information is hugely important in understanding how fair different energy transition pathways might be.

The methodology and the integration of new data sets can also be used for future policy analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6770AE27-E06D-40A8-BA4B-CDB2F68FC9C6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56da09568ac818.44726280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://teresproject.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>02355034-10DD-40FD-A87B-ED3EDC2FADF5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Special issue: Household transport costs, economic stress and vulnerability, at the interface between mobility, domestic energy and residential location</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transport Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8be208f940250ba5d7a2c7a233090321"><gtr:id>8be208f940250ba5d7a2c7a233090321</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mattioli, G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56163f7d605a60.07260170</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36D107F7-51CA-4B09-B58C-372014E58228</gtr:id><gtr:title>The affordability of household transport costs: quantifying the incidence of car-related economic stress in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8be208f940250ba5d7a2c7a233090321"><gtr:id>8be208f940250ba5d7a2c7a233090321</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mattioli, G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56163a57017da4.09950105</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D64AF425-514B-4B6A-8DFE-8F5AF5C6420F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Household transport costs, economic stress and energy vulnerability</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transport Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d09aea9a4e87ea8d1323f04f33ad1a42"><gtr:id>d09aea9a4e87ea8d1323f04f33ad1a42</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mattioli G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a5f480a046235.31337482</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C17A97E0-A6D4-4AAB-8214-6C8A35F45E8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transport needs in a climate-constrained world.
