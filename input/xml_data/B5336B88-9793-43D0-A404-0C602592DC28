Information on changes that occur with time is generally measured using longitudinal population based studies. Although these studies provide direct information on changes and the age at which they occur, they also suffer from potential problems due to dropout of respondents as a result of refusal, migration and death. If this is not taken into account reported results can seriously underestimate disease and disability in the population. Dr Matthews programme aims to investigate the health changes caused by ageing that take into account the difficulties of the studies that were used to derive them. In this way, proper public health statements can be made and used to develop policy for the future. Dr Johnsons collaborative programme of clinical trials and other studies in mental health, epilepsy, transfusion medicine, and other ares of medicine, aims to provide better understanding of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of treatment, and of the natural history of disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1. MRC Collaborative Group for the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) (Dr F Matthews) Overall strategic control (planning, co-ordination, and development) of statistical analysis within this large, UK, multi-centre, epidemiological, cohort study of cognitive decline and dementia. The study provides estimates of prevalence and incidence of dementia, including regional variation, and of the factors which influence them. Sub-studies of blood and brain tissue elucidate the role of genetic factors in the development of cognitive decline, and of the neuropathological processes which characterise dementia in the community. Other sub-studies investigate the costs of continuing care and the burden on carers. 2. Clinical trials in Mental Health (Dr T Johnson) Supervision of statisticians within the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at the Institute of Psychiatry (IoP), London, in setting up, designing, and analysing, multi-centre clinical trials in psychiatry. Supervision of analysis of clinical trials of drug treatment of agitation in dementia, and of dementia itself. Independent statistician on Data Monitoring and Ethics Committees of trials of drug treatment in bipolar disorder and Downs syndrome. 3. Epilepsy (Dr T Johnson) A programme of inter-leaving epidemiological studies and clinical trials. Investigations to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the new, more expensive, AEDs with the older, established drugs. Advice to Minister for Transport, through the DVLA Advisory Panel on Driving and Disorders of the Nervous System about driving licence regulations, and suitability of individuals to drive. 4. Linkage between MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge and MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London Advice within the Division for Other Diseases at the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London on the setting-up and design of both epidemiological studies and clinical trials with the National Blood Service in England, in the novel area of Transfusion Medicine, including supervision of a statistical post to underpin this programme. Similar role in the setting-up and analysis of clinical trials in other medical specialties.
