They are considering the feasibility of using fresh ideas, generated by an examination of policy and practice in North America and Western Europe, to initiate innovative practice and policy that will boost the production of affordable housing for rent in the UK. The research is building on previous research into housing supply overseas by CCHR. &amp;nbsp;There is an emphasis on financial incentives to boost housing construction for affordable rented housing in the USA and France (although incentives in other countries are also being considered). &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The lesson learning from experience overseas is being addressed through a series of discussions, presentations and seminars involving PfP staff and other stakeholders including housing organisations and government departments. The target audience for the research is non-academic stakeholders in the private, public and civil society sectors. It will thus be of relevance to a range of housing producers, including private firms and housing associations. It will furthermore have significant implications for government policy towards housing production.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Over time, this research is intended to increase the volume of housing construction in the UK. In particular it is expected to have a positive effect on the amount of affordable rented housing that is to be occupied by households who cannot afford home ownership or commercial rents. It will benefit a wide spectrum of society, and indeed society and the economy as whole through the positive social and economic impacts of an increase in housing production.

In the shorter term, the principal impacts will be on those who participate in the research and those who are influenced by its findings. A key participant and a partner in the bid is Places for People (PfP), one of the largest suppliers of housing in the UK. This research will inform the practices of the organisation as it learns from practices in other countries that lead to increased rates of production. The company has already shown an interest in internationally inspired innovation through its plans to develop a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) to raise funds for investment in new housing. This project will help them to gain awareness of other ideas that have worked elsewhere. During the research this knowledge will be made available to other housing suppliers, including housing associations and private developers, who .participate in the research. Findings will be placed in the public domain at the end of the work, meaning all housing producers will be able to benefit.

The research will be of interest to all housing providers and to their representative organisations. There will, in particular, be interest in the findings from the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation and the Home Builders Federation. All of these organisations will, though the proposed engagement strategy, be made aware of the findings.

Much of the work will concern government policies in other countries. It will investigate how public policy can incentivise affordable rented housing through, for example, favourable tax treatment and low cost finance. The research will illustrate how, for example, taxation has been used in the USA and France to encourage developers (in the public, private and non-profit sectors) to build housing. Such housing, with policy determined conditions attached to the rents charged and to the socio-economic status of the occupants, has been promoted through a variety of approaches in these countries and others. The ideas that come from other countries, and North America and Western Europe in particular, will be set alongside the success (including the numbers of dwellings built) of these measures. The research will explore the reality of such ideas informing policy in the UK. It will be of relevance to the housing policies applied by governments in England and in the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Government departments in England, especially the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Treasury will be contacted as part of the research process. They will be offered information from the research findings and will be asked to comment on the feasibility and the desirability of policy changes. The major political parties in England will also be made aware of the interim and final findings from the research and asked to participate in an exchange of ideas over the course of the research.

After the research is completed all the evidence and the conclusions will be in the public domain. There will thus be an opportunity for policy makers throughout the UK to benefit from the improved knowledge that the research generates. The potential for an impact on policy depends upon the acceptance of ideas and quantifiable evidence collected from the research project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58980</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K007564/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
