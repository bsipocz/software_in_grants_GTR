Detailed information about molecular structure is obtained from orientation-dependent nuclear spin interactions, such as the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA). Measurements of these can be made from wideline NMR spectra of powdered solids which show singularities corresponding directly to the principal components of the tensor which describes the interaction. However, spectral overlap means that it is often necessary to resort instead to an analysis of the intensities of the rotational sidebands which appear in the magic angle spinning (MAS) spectrum, and this approach has become routine in the case of the CSA. Furthermore, it has been shown recently that analysis of a moderate number (approximately 8-10) of spinning sidebands usually gives more reliable results than fitting the wideline spectrum. A relatively low spinning rate is normally required to give this many sidebands, and so many two-dimensional MAS NMR experiments have been developed which separate the sideband manifolds from different sites and further improve resolution. In particular, we have shown recently how to record spectra in which the sideband intensities are identical to those expected for a sample spinning at some fraction of the actual MAS rate. This &amp;quot;CSA amplification&amp;quot; experiment represents a new approach to the measurement of nuclear spin interactions and was the starting point for the research funded by grant EP/E003052.

During the period of the grant we have further developed the CSA amplification experiment, introducing sequences with larger amplification factors. These allow the experiment to operate at the fastest available MAS rates and in combination with state-of-the-art heteronuclear decoupling sequences. We have made measurements of the carbon-13 CSA parameters for a number of disaccharides and nucleic acids, and compared the results with calculated tensors to extract structural information. In addition, we have shown how to use this combination of experiment and calculation to make assignments of the resonances in poorly-resolved MAS spectra. We have designed a new experiment which uses CSA amplification to study molecular dynamics, and we have illustrated its efficacy with a study of the ultra-slow molecular motions responsible for the impact strength of helical semi-crystalline polymers. We have also designed a new class of &amp;quot;CSA attenuation&amp;quot; experiments which can be used for heavy nuclei such as 207Pb where the shift anisotropy is large and the samples are dense, precluding rapid MAS.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The methodologies might be modified or improved by other researchers.
