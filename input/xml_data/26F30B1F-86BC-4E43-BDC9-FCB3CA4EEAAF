It can also increase health care costs for the hospital and waiting times for the patient. I will investigate the causes and consequences of non-attendance at outpatient appointment. By collating a variety of data sets I will be able to use detailed information about patient characteristics, their GP practices and hospital of treatment to provide a fuller understanding of patient outpatient attendance. My work will improve the evidence base for policies to improve attendance and I will use patient travel costs to impute monetary valuations to outpatient appointments. I will investigate the impact of recent government policy to increase patient choice and improve booking systems for outpatient appointments by looking at non-attendance before and after the introduction of the new system. I will also investigate the effects of non-attendance on patient health outcomes including emergency hospital admission and mortality.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims: Non-attendance at outpatient appointments is considered an indicator of poorer access to health care services and may lead to worse health outcomes. It can increase health care costs and waiting times by reducing hospital productivity. The project will analyse the causes and consequences of non-attendance at outpatient appointments using economic analytical methods to inform policy makers? decisions about cost-effective ways to reduce non-attendance.

Objectives: Estimate the effects of patient, general practitioner, and hospital characteristics on non-attendance. Estimate the monetary value to patients of appointments and their characteristics. Evaluate the impact of the Choose and Book policy on non-attendance rates. Estimate the impact of non-attendance on patient outcomes. Investigate the equity implications. Use the results of the analyses to review the costs and benefits of policies to reduce non-attendance. 

Design: Observational study using routine administrative data on individual outpatient attendances from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for the whole of England between 2003/4 and 2009/10. 

Methods: HES data will be linked to census and administrative data via patient area of residence. Patient pathways (past and future utilisation and mortality) will be mapped from HES. Distance and travel costs of attendance will be estimated using Geographical Information Science applications and Department of Transport data. Data on GP practice characteristics including quality of care and hospital quality. Multivariate regression models for discrete choice will be used to estimate the effects of patient, appointment, GP practice, and hospital characteristics on the probability of non-attendance. Imputed travel costs will be used to estimate patients? willingness to pay for an outpatient appointment and for changes in its characteristics such as moving services closer to patients and reduced waiting times. Allowance for selection bias in non-attend will be made in the analysis of travel costs and patient outcomes. Differences in Differences methods will be used to estimate the impact of Choose and Book by comparing non-attendance before and after its introduction with referrals unaffected by Choose and Book. 

Scientific opportunity: The opportunity to exploit recent availability of HES outpatient records; linkable to inpatient records and mortality data. Utilise new GIS technology for estimating travel times. To use improved information on GP practice care from the Quality and Outcomes Framework.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>214666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Lausanne</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Health Economics and Management, HEC</gtr:department><gtr:description>Secondment to University of Lausanne</gtr:description><gtr:id>51204DB1-1B98-40FE-8FD3-71F62F6432FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have written a preliminary report into the subsidy system for health insurance in canton Vaud for the Cour de Comptes</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>PzuF1G8mWNM-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They have provided full access to teaching and research facilities.

Presented to clinical leads and C&amp;amp;B program implementers. Since presentation I have been contacted again to keep them updated on current findings. Sent latest results on 4/12/2012 and discussed findings with Clive Pickles C&amp;amp;B clinical lead who will present them to the team while I am in Lausanne.

Impact so far has been that continued collaboration with the Choose and Book implementation team.
