Today, when media coverage is central to terror campaigns, and newscasters serve as embedded journalists in the war on terror's televisual front, understanding how the moving image is implicated in the imaginations and actions of perpetrators and survivors of mass-violence is all the more urgent.\nThis project contributes to such an understanding. It develops innovative filmmaking methods to explore people perform, remember and recount acts of genocidal violence.\nThe research focuses on Indonesia, where, in 1965-66, up to one million trade unionists, organised peasants and alleged communists were murdered in the space of six months. Unlike in Rwanda or Cambodia, here there have been no truth and reconciliation commissions, no trials, no memorials for victims--only triumphant slogans of 'national struggle'. Indeed, the perpetrators have been promoted through the ranks of military and government, and continue to be celebrated as national heroes.\nCinema is often directly implicated in the imagination and machinery of this genocide. In Indonesia, not only did some death squads emerge from gangs controlling black markets in movie tickets, some executioners explicitly fashioned themselves after Hollywood stars who were projected on the screens that provided their livelihood.\nWorking with perpetrators and survivors, this project uses cinema to access and present details of the genocide's history, while exploring how cinema is an actor in this history.\nDrawing on the cinematic fantasies of perpetrators, the project creates a unique opportunity to explore both the routines of violence and the rhetoric and imagination of the killing machine. Perpetrators dramatise their roles in the killings, suggesting genres and directing scenes. The project documents these efforts, emphasising the tension between accuracy and perpetrators' desire to stylise, to be seen as gangster or generalissimo, as the case may be. This disturbing dramatic space is used to explore how the killings became daily routine, and this, in turn, will provide insight into why violence we would hope to be unimaginable is not only imagined, but also routinely performed.\nAnalysing the genres of these dramatisations, we investigate the violence itself, but also the genres of its subsequent historical rendition. We explore how the violence was originally staged as a spectacle, one whose 'theatre of operations' was to be symbolically rehearsed again and again both in official histories and in the lurid boasting of the 'heroes', carrying a charge of terror across generations. \nIn response to perpetrators' performances, we develop creative filmmaking forums for survivors to act out memories of genocide that would otherwise remain repressed, giving voice and vision to the experiences of a community who share a history they can never forget, but were forbidden to remember.\nWhile perpetrators are keen to celebrate the killings through a musical film--a chilling and revealing artefact of a genocidal imagination flourishing in impunity--survivors explore their own memories of the massacres through improvisational Javanese opera and the calling of ghosts. The result is a cinematic record of how victims and perpetrators are in contest for control over their history.\nThis project will result in a film, DVD-ROM, a book and a series of public discussions. But perhaps as importantly, where families and friends of victims live alongside the genocide's administrators, this project recovers crucial historical detail, offers insight into the dynamics of a precarious coexistence, and opens possibilities for dialogue and resolution.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>396698</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A feature documentary film, 115 min, HD

The Act of Killing investigates an original filmmaking method and formally innovative film work that contribute to critical understandings of how individuals and groups perform, remember and recount acts of genocidal violence. We have termed this method of documentary film making 'archaeological performance'. Through archaeological performance, the film seeks to recover crucial logistical and operational detail about the genocide, and to analyse the genres and grammars through which both its violence and its subsequent official history have been staged in the city of Medan in North Sumatra. The Act of Killing's subjects are the Indonesian paramilitary leader Anwar Congo and his band of dedicated followers. In the 1960s, Anwar and his friends spent their lives at the movies, where they controlled a black market in tickets, while using the cinema as a base of operations for more serious crimes. When the government of President Sukarno was overthrown by the military in 1965, the army recruited them to form death squads, as they had a proven capacity for violence and they hated the communists for boycotting American films - the most popular - and profitable - in the cinemas. Anwar and his friends were devoted fans of James Dean, John Wayne, and Victor Mature. They explicitly fashioned themselves and their methods of murder after their Hollywood idols. In this film, the unrepentant former members of Indonesian death squads re-enact some of their many murders in the style of the American movies they love.</gtr:description><gtr:id>ECA4E2FF-EDB5-4B0B-AC29-0312B0F5079A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>winnner oF BAFTA and Oscar nominated for best Documentary, 2013</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-7585618055.970984a716a848</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Act of Killing</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://theactofkilling.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>extensive use in exposing the hidden history of event in Indonesia 1965-66 in the country and internationally</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9B6ACE29-DD03-4AE6-A28E-1FF607F332B1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>543c12077116d7.78057829</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>An innovative documentary film form</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>enable similar film projects activities</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7743E75C-BE1E-4ED9-8C2B-5E44619E5727</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>543c1319b201c2.66901308</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://theactofkilling.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0F7AF0E3-EF8A-479E-A661-7B4749B44326</gtr:id><gtr:title>Killer Images: Documentary Film, Memory and the Performance of Violence</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fb8a564b8045da9d275c9a29f537fef1"><gtr:id>fb8a564b8045da9d275c9a29f537fef1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>ten Brink Joram</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-231-16334-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_18286868323bf778d6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F009542/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
