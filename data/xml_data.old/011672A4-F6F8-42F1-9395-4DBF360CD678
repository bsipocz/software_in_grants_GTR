Thirty-four seasons of excavations took place between 1904 and 1979, but the results have remained unpublished. This project will analyse and publish the archive of excavations at Glastonbury Abbey by iconic figures in the history of archaeology: St John Hope (1904), Bligh Bond (1908-21), Peers and Clapham (1928-39) and Ralegh Radford (1951-64). The Trustees of Glastonbury Abbey are project partners and the results of the study will inform site interpretation and museum display.\n\nGlastonbury was one of the earliest monasteries in England, likely dating from the seventh century, and was reputedly the only one to have enjoyed continuous occupation to the sixteenth century. In 1191 the monks alleged that they had uncovered the graves of Arthur and Guinevere, and later they promoted a link with Joseph of Arimathea, claiming that he had founded the first church in AD 63. The Arthurian connection was developed after a devastating fire of 1184, when funds were needed to rebuild the Abbey. \n\nArchaeological excavations focused on the main claustral ranges and parts of the cemetery, and substantial assemblages were recovered of worked stone, window glass, pottery, ceramic tiles and small finds. The site's central importance to archaeological scholarship stems from the interim publication of a series of early medieval churches, a vallum enclosure, potentially the earliest cloister in Britain, and craft-working activities including unique glass furnaces. This project will analyse the archive records and excavated finds to consider key research questions. Is there evidence for occupation pre-dating the early monastery? What is the form and date of the early 'family' of churches and the first cloister? Can continuous occupation be demonstrated? What was the scale and extent of the early craft-working centre? Is it possible to reconstruct the zoning and land-use of the early monastery and the subsequent development of the medieval precinct? Can we reconstruct the architectural form, style and development of the later medieval abbey? Did the emphasis placed on myth and cult activities create a distinctive layout in the medieval church and cloister? \n\nAnalysis of the archive will be complemented by a new geophysical survey of the precinct. The geophysics will enhance interpretation of the cloister excavations and increase knowledge of the broader precinct. It will also facilitate the assessment of surviving buried deposits, contributing to their conservation and guiding future research. \nThe full publication of the Glastonbury archive will achieve a major landmark in monastic archaeology. Beyond the intrinsic historical significance of the Abbey, the site is of demonstrated international importance in understanding early medieval glassworking, and for advancing understanding of the transition between the early and later medieval monastic plans. \n\nThe results of the project will be published as a monograph and will be accessible as an online database through the Archaeology Data Service. This project will present new findings on a site that is highly valued by the international academic audience, the local community and the multi-denominational community of visitors to the Abbey, numbering over 100,000 each year.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>339640</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An exhibition was mounted at Glastonbury Abbey Museum based on the findings of the research project. 12 panels of text were prepared and these were displayed together with objects from the excavations.

&amp;quot;Glass furnaces recorded in 1955-7 were previously thought to date from before the Norman Conquest. However, radiocarbon dating has now revealed that they date approximately to the 680s, and are likely to be associated with a major rebuilding of the abbey undertaken by King Ine of Wessex. Glass-making at York and Wearmouth is recorded in historical documents in the 670s but Glastonbury provides the earliest and most substantial archaeological evidence for glass-making in Saxon Britain.



The extensive remains of five furnaces have been identified, together with fragments of clay crucibles and glass for window glazing and drinking vessels, mainly of vivid blue-green colour. It is likely that specialist glassworkers came from Gaul (France) to work at Glastonbury. The glass will be analysed chemically to provide further information on the sourcing and processing of materials.

Professor Gilchrist said: &amp;quot;Glastonbury Abbey is a site of international historical importance but until now the excavations have remained unpublished. The research project reveals new evidence for the early date of the monastery at Glastonbury and charts its development over one thousand years, from the 6th century to its dissolution in the 16th century.&amp;quot;

An exhibition at Glastonbury Abbey Museum, 'From Fire &amp;amp; Earth', tells the story of the Abbey's pioneering role in medieval crafts and technology, and runs until 16 September 2012.&amp;quot;

Review: The conference was reviewed in the online publication of the Antiquaries (SALON, 288: 28 November 2012). 



&amp;quot;Until now Glastonbury has been viewed through the filter of an interim report published by Radford in 1981 in which he argued for a series of Anglo-Saxon monastic churches and an early Saxon cemetery, associated with Britain's earliest formal monastic cloister and with a series of early glass furnaces. In her paper, Roberta Gilchrist examined the evidence for each of these claims and cast doubt on Radford's interpretation. There is pottery evidence of something going on here in the late fifth and early sixth centuries, but nothing that can be securely characterised as monastic. The masonry that Radford thought was part of the cloister consist of fragments that do not align, and that probably belong to separate buildings: the supposed cloister would, in any event, have been huge - built on a scale not paralleled anywhere else. Roberta's iconoclastic paper concluded that there was evidence of sixth-century occupation, and for a major campaign of church building in the late seventh century, but an almost total absence of the sort of material culture that one would expect for the mid- to late Saxon periods. Clearly there was an early monastic presence at Glastonbury, but that we had yet to locate the main structures, which might well lie north of the churches, not to the south, which is where Radford mainly excavated.&amp;quot;

The symposium reported progress on the AHRC research project and the associated CDA project. It was featured as the 'annual symposium' of the Society of Antiquaries of London and was also advertised in the Glastonbury region. I received follow up invitations to deliver papers and to write a popular article. I also received very positive email feedback from local stakeholders including trustees of Glastonbury Abbey.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r_90475472780c16810a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.glastonburyabbeysymposium.com/speaker.php?&amp;id=1001&amp;rpn=background</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Broadcast Media response to book launch</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0AF2548-C554-4F24-B1F8-3588EA556813</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following the press release and an article in The Guardian, I was interviewed by the following TV and radio to discuss the Glastonbury Abbey project:

Over 120 students came from Somerset, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. They participated in workshops handling archaeological finds, had a tour of the ruins and a lecture on the Glastonbury Abbey Archaeological Archive Project. They also participated in a mind-mapping exercise in which they first listed their prior understanding of Glastonbury Abbey and then after the workshop listed how their understanding had changed. There was also a blog competition for the students to express what they had learned.

We received follow up emails from teachers asking for additional information on the project. Students submitted blogs and this was posted by the University of Reading. The winning entry was from Bruton School for girls and is quoted below. This student was awarded a placement day working 'behind the scenes' at Glastonbury Abbey. 

'Despite my love of history, I have never studied or seriously researched Archaeology. The talks at Glastonbury Abbey have helped to change that! From learning about the excavation of bones, to the science behind the archaeology itself, the whole day was fascinating and I came away with new interests and a desire to know more. 
Professor Roberta Gilchrist's talk on how archaeological techniques can help us to understand the medieval world was enlightening and brought alive a subject I hadn't previously considered. The idea that, using carbon dating techniques, a piece of pottery can give us accurate data on the age of the monastery is amazing. Learning about and seeing a geophysical survey was exciting and I was surprised by how much archaeologists can learn without digging-and destroying the evidence. 
Although I had previously heard a few of the Glastonbury Abbey myths, I didn't know much about it before I arrived and the influence it once had was completely unknown to me. The mind map we were asked to write at the beginning of the day certainly highlighted that; however, by the afternoon, I could recount a detailed chronology of the abbey's history alongside some of its many legends, and the reasons behind them. I think what captured my attention most, was the idea that when, in 1191, the monks at Glastonbury claimed to dig up the grave of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere. They were probably just trying to make money and had no idea of the effect that the myth would have, not only on the thousands of visitors that were attracted to the Abbey by it, but on how it would influence future historical research of the site. 
Meeting leading archaeologists and learning about their work was really interesting. The range of information and different types of work they are doing is incredible and has opened my eyes to many aspects of archaeology I hadn't previously thought about. How it is presented, for example, is key in how much people learn and how much of an interest they take in the subject. The bones found at the site help us to discover what type of lifestyle the monks at the Abbey lived and the ecosystems and fossils found, work with the geophysical technology to show where buildings would have once been. 
Although the day showed that real archaeology doesn't happen like it does on 'Time Team', it opened my eyes to career options I had never previously considered and gave my love of history a new dimension.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8509684706.5814630cd4eb22</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Small grant from the Society for Medieval Archaeology 2011</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Society for Medieval Archaeology</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2DA459E9-1B2A-408C-B9FC-EE88E7EF20F9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4266283050.4274770687a88e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>79000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Follow on Funding for Impact and Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>23046374-56F7-401A-B5FD-CED4B7230900</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56850fd4b60447.06399768</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Small grant from Gray Fund of the Somerset Archaeology &amp;amp; Natural History Society</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Somerset Archaeology &amp; Natural History Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>435E68C5-E6AC-4B29-896F-1E336B93B32F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5945183286.3923010687bacc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1044</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Additional radiocarbon dates for Glastonbury Abbey</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Somerset Archaeology &amp; Natural History Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>56ED025F-D554-4166-93A5-E301BF899913</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7013850209.3160990687aa6e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research findings have been used extensively at Glastonbury Abbey and have influenced conservation and collections policy and approaches to interpretation and education (including a new Interpretation Strategy).

The monograph and associated online database were launched in November 2015 and the monograph was published open access in November 2016. The monograph critically evaluates the archaeological evidence and its value for understanding the Abbey's unique place in the story of English monasticism. The medieval abbey achieved international fame as the burial place of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere: the monks claimed to have excavated their graves in 1191. An origins myth was cultivated to proclaim Glastonbury's primacy among English monasteries: a history was commissioned from William of Malmesbury (c 1129-30) which hinted that the first church on the site had been built by the Disciples of Christ. Later versions embellished Glastonbury's origins story: by the 14th century, it was believed that the old church had been built by Joseph of Arimathea, the great-uncle of Christ. The Arimathean legend connected Glastonbury directly to the life of Christ, providing a justification for the Abbeys spiritual pre-eminence and establishing its significance to English cultural identity. 

The key findings are:

- New evidence for previously unknown prehistoric, Roman and Saxon occupation on the site of the Abbey, pre-dating the earliest documented Saxon monastery at Glastonbury.
 - A craft-working complex of 5 glass furnaces representing the earliest and most substantial evidence for glass-working in Saxon England. It has been radiocarbon dated to c. AD 700.
- Several details of Radford's interpretation of the early medieval monastery are challenged, including the existence of a pre-Christian 'British' cemetery, the discovery of Arthur's grave, and the alleged Saxon cloister, supposedly the first in England.
- Re-examination of the records has confirmed evidence for the Norman and later medieval monastic ranges and revealed the exceptional scale of the abbot's lodging, a luxurious palatial complex to the southwest of the cloister.
- There are many conservative or retrospective elements evident in the architecture of Glastonbury Abbey; this tendency seems to have been deliberate and strategic, aimed at demonstrating the antiquity of Glastonbury and its pre-eminent place in monastic history.
- The distinctive layout and development of the Abbey was influenced by its origin legends; the religious and cult focus of the site was to the west of the Abbey church, centred on the Lady Chapel that occupied the site of the legendary early church that was destroyed by fire in 1184.

These findings have immediate implications for the interpretation and presentation of the site to the public (over 100,000 per annum), including visitors whose principal motivation is to view the grave-site of Arthur.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has influenced the planning of a major Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) Application by Glastonbury Abbey, submitted in November 2016. The research was used to create a 3D model of the abbey precinct for planning purposes and a new strategy for site layout and signage is being developed based on improved archaeological understanding of the site. 

AHRC FoF enabled the creation of digital reconstructions based on the research, to enhance visitor experience and understanding of the site. It also supported the development of educational resources linked to the National Curriculum (KS 2/3, GCSE, OCR) and family trails, for schools and independent visitors to Glastonbury Abbey. The research was also used in a new guide book for visitors and a magazine article. All resources were co-produced with the Director and staff of Glastonbury Abbey.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9DB43085-E46F-4951-A62B-5CD7B6443C98</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb2c6fcc5b12.37396498</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/glastonbury_ahrc_2014/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database uses the 'Integrated Archaeological Database' developed by the York Archaeological Trust.
