As part of the AHRC's highlight theme of 'translating cultures', this project offers for study a well-known example of cultural transmission, that of antique revival in Renaissance art. Specifically, the intended research is concerned with inter-visual dialogues between painting and sculpture in European art of the long Renaissance. Renaissance painting was predicated on the imitation of antiquity, thus its quest was to 'translate' the forms of sculpture into the medium of paint. To arrive at a fuller understanding of the channels of transmission between the antique past and Renaissance painting the research highlights the artistic processes of medial translation through which this great cultural transfer occurred. To do so it draws on the Renaissance debate as to the relative merits of painting and sculpture, the so-called paragone, or comparison of the arts. 

The study converges on Renaissance paintings of the ancient gods, specifically Venus and her child Cupid, because of the particularly close ties between ancient statuary and early modern painted figurations of their forms. In addition to its analysis of medial translation, the research is thus also concerned with the cultural translation of canons of female bodily beauty from the art of antiquity to the Renaissance and beyond. It addresses both the methods and meanings of the artistic translation of ancient sculptural remnants of Venus into mythological paintings for Renaissance courts; and the produring yet conflicted power of Venus's representation in Western art as a cultural signifier of female beauty. By focussing on particularly dense instances of her appropriation and translation within early modern court art, the research troubles the apparently seamless history of her representation to highlight instead the conflicts of culture attending her translation-cum-appropriation. More broadly, the research juxtaposes visual 'sources' and their citations in art, reading difference as a type of resistance that may take the form of purposeful misappropriation and critical translation. 

Dissemination of the research will be through conference papers, articles in peer-review journals, and a touring exhibition of prints and drawings with an accompanying catalogue. One conference paper/article will be concerned with Velazquez's Rokeby Venus painted for the Spanish king, Philip IV. As has long been noted, the painting represents an apogee in Velazquez's productive engagement with the work of Titian, who had also painted Venus for the Spanish court. Thus Velazquez's Venus is replete with a knowledge of this goddess's long representation in the history of both Renaissance painting and antique sculpture, yet it is also a powerful translation that would itself seed many further imitations. The second paper is concerned with Caravaggio's Sleeping Cupid. Painted for a Florentine patron, it is surely a form of artistic commentary on Michelangelo's early sculptural rendition of this same theme (now lost). The study demands consideration of Caravaggio's intended visual effect in the act of translation from sculpture into paint, which may be read as an artistic polemic against Michelangelo's 'maniera statuina'. Both articles also address the theme of temporal/geographical translations of antique revial in art across the map of Europe. The exhibition will take a broader view of tropes of bodily beauty to map their changing construction across time, place, and medium. This rests on a conception of body beauty as culturally constructed and subject to an historical process of imitation, translation, and difference. Through a series of visual comparisons, the exhibition will present an argument about the artistic translation of figurative motifs to represent beauty from one work of art, one medium, and one historical context, to another.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's pathway for societal-economic impact for its research is through an engagement with the museums and galleries sector and third-sector arts organisations. A touring exhibition constitutes a major component of the work plan. The focus of the exhibition, cultural perceptions of bodily beauty, seeks to engage its audiences in an analytical and historical understanding of beauty as socially constructed and therefore subject to difference according to time, place, and artistic medium. The exhibition will trace historical continuities/ruptures in the representation of ideal bodies in early modern European prints and drawings. It will seek to show that even within the formation of Western art's classic tropes of ideal beauty, the history of its serial 'translations' across temporal, geographical and medial boundaries embodies cultural conflicts of gender and race within its forms. A further aim of the exhibition is to lend an historical dimension to current debate about the presentation of the body in visual culture today. 

The project reflects the commitment of Britain's national museums and galleries sector to engage local audiences through the geographical redistribution of its art works in the form of touring exhibitions that rotate the nation's cultural capital across the country. Because of the richness of our national holdings of 'Old Master' prints and drawings, exhibitions of these works are necessarily of international significance. At the same time, their relocation by means of touring exhibitions enables local communities and economies to benefit from and engage with these works of art. Their travelling display brings increased numbers of visitors to their host arts organisations and to the local area, with financial benefits for regional arts centres and economies. The exhibition will also strengthen collaborative relationships between national museums, regional art centres, and academics. It can exemplify the role of cultural heritage in building collaborations between the university and museums and galleries sector, and third-sector arts centres. 

The proposed host institutions for the exhibition also comprise organisations with professional training programmes for artists. Through linked programmes with artists-in-residence the exhibition can impact on the practice of artists, enhancing the cultural development and outreach of both. An educational programme of events comprising art classes and lectures for adults and school pupils in the local communities can further extend the societal impact of the exhibition. It should also yield public dissemination in the form of press and radio coverage, as well as reviews that address both the historical and critical impacts of the exhibition.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12221</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This research culminated in an exhibition in a public art gallery with accompanying events for the public such as short talks and lectures, and an exhibition catalogue for sale in the museum shop.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C75BD65A-F8B2-46FE-AF12-ECF6017DB527</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d47adc86d898.23197803</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research took an old question to make it into a new question.
