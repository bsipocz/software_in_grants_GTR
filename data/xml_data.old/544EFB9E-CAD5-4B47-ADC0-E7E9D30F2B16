NICE guidelines state that obesity treatment needs to include strategies to increase people's physical activity levels, improve eating behaviour and reduce energy intake. Lifestyle coaching sessions including education and physical activities are often delivered to groups in local community centres and schools. However, some of the most severely affected members of society do not have cost-effective access to these life-changing treatments because they find travel difficult or impossible. So here we propose to use technology deployed 'in the wild' to help specific groups of housebound obese individuals: people with learning disability or with psychological problems such as anxiety or depression that keep them at home and others who are functionally limited because of their physical condition. We know that there is much to be gained from engaging overweight and obese individuals in moderate physical activity. Even small improvements in this group could greatly enhance their wellbeing and personal health so one of our goals will be to see how much impact we can make on an individual's ability to engage in everyday activities.

Virtual worlds are live, online, interactive 3-dimensional environments in which users interact using speech or text via a personalised avatar. Accessible from home all that is required is a modern computer and internet connection. Primarily used for social reasons, healthcare practitioners are increasingly utilising virtual worlds for team training, conferences, patient support groups and collaborative team-working.

Our group at Imperial College London is currently working with the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and MoreLife (a provider of weight loss interventions for obese and overweight children and adults) to provide virtual wor group coaching for weightloss. MoreLife, our official project partner, delivers a 12-week educational programme across the internet, where participants attend as avatars and do not have to travel, or expose their real selves in public. In these groups they learn about food intake and nutrition, and are encouraged to engage in more physical activity and exercise. A slideshow illustrating the virtual world pilot project can be seen here: http://tinyurl.com/healthrez.

Here we propose to take this several steps further by using the Microsoft Kinect Sensor to enable housebound individuals to attend group sessions incorporating physical activities specially designed to help them transform their lives. The Kinect is a motion sensing input device developed by Microsoft initially for the Xbox video game console and more recently for the Windows PC. Incorporating depth-sensing webcams, it can directly capture the user's movements and transmit them across the internet where they are mirrored by their avatars, without the need for anyone to see a video image of the real person. A movie demonstration is available here: http://tinyurl.com/healthrezk. 

Our potential users, their carers and our partners' instructors are very enthusiastic about this project and we hope to show that by deploying this extremely cost-effective and scalable digital technology we can improve this disadvantaged group's health and wellbeing and thereby provide them with life opportunities previously denied them. We have already shown in a previous study that virtual worlds can be used to provide health care-related information to people with learning disability, and we will continue this work with the Grace Eyre Foundation in Brighton and with other charitable foundations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries will include:

Academia: We hope to show that body sensors can be used in this new cross-disciplinary area of application, and is of interest both nationally and internationally, as it will enable behavioural information to be delivered or monitored remotely across the internet.

The National Health Service: We know that even small improvements in physical activity in the 3 groups we are working with can have a major impact on their cardiovascular and general health, and thereby help to prevent the development of further co-morbidities that place demands on the NHS's limited resources. 

The National Health Service, Local Authorities and Public Health organisations: By demonstrating how behaviour change services can be delivered remotely over the internet we are also pointing the way to the possibility of new modes of service provision, and a general transformation of the way that healthcare and social services may be delivered in the future. This has implications for policymakers nationally and internationally.

The following disadvantaged groups in society: People with learning disability with a propensity towards overweight and obesity, the obese and morbidly obese, people with temporary mental health issues that cause them to become overweight. The families of these individuals will also benefit. These groups should benefit by being able to participate more fully in social activities, by better health and wellbeing and by a sense of achievement after possibly years of experiencing only failures.

Businesses, such as MoreLife, who provide weight management services for the overweight and obese, as they should be able to use the technologies and techniques we develop.

Third sector organisations including charitable trusts such as the Grace Eyre Foundation, and institutions such as Schools who struggle with the problems caused by overweight and obesity.

In the long run technology-enabled remote service delivery has the potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of many public services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>244664</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MoreLife</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MoreLife, Leeds Metropolitan University</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DABC1B9-7369-4428-A579-FAB028700BCA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper has been published that has been co-authored by staff at MoreLife, Leeds University and staff at Imperial College London.

1) Use of motion sensor games to encourage exercise for adults with learning disability (LD) and 2) Use of motion sensor games to encourage exercise for obese children. 

1) Use of motion sensor games to encourage exercise for adults with learning disability (LD):
Adults with Learning disability (LD) can have limited mobility and independence and are at high risk of failing to comply with physical activity guidelines, which makes them more likely to be overweight or obese and experience health problems such as coronary vascular disease or stroke. Previous studies have found that reasons that this sample are not able to exercise are: transport needs, staffing constraints, participant income, unclear policy guidelines for day and residential services and limited options for physical active community leisure. We aimed to enable, facilitate and encourage physical activity for this sample by implementing motion-sensor games at a 'keep fit' session at a day centre for adults with LD.
It was found that using the games raised users' heart rates, validating the games as a form of exercise for this population. The participants reported to have enjoyed the game. Interviews with staff at the centre revealed numerous ways in which the games were advantageous for adults with LD including their ability to provide enjoyable activities and elicit improvement in coordination. Interview results also indicated that the games had led to improved engagement and behaviour for the group.
The results suggest that motion sensor games can be a useful and enjoyable way for exercising for adults with LD; we argue that this mode can provide a way of exercising that is less affected by the usual barriers that can affect this population, because the games are free to use online, and can be accessed from anywhere.

2) Use of motion sensor games to encourage exercise for obese children: 
Physical inactivity is associated with childhood obesity, which is at a crisis level internationally, with alarmingly high prevalence in the United Kingdom (UK). There is evidence that obese children are at high risk of becoming obese adults; being obese can negatively impact quality of life through a number of factors including severely limiting the mobility of the individual.
Increased physical activity can help individuals to lose weight, but this can be difficult to sustain, particularly for children. There is evidence that obese children tend to perceive themselves as being less capable of exercise than normal-weight children, which is likely to partly explain their tendency to be less active and their difficulty in sustaining positive changes to physical activity regimens that result from interventions.
A total of 116 children took part in the study including 71 children from the MoreLife summer camp in Leeds and 45 Spanish schoolchildren. The MoreLife summer camp lasts for 6 weeks. Children played the games as part of a weekly 'Lifestyle Session' session that took place in an IT classroom. Eight children played the games at once, every 15 minutes.
Using the games increased the heart rate of the participants, validating it as a form of exercise. The lower the participants' Perceived Exercise Capability (PEC), the more overweight they were likely to be. Our results suggest that the motion sensor game helped participants feel more capable of exercising: The more the participants at the summer camp enjoyed the game, the more their PEC improved. PEC scores improved significantly over the course of the camp for those who reported to enjoy at least one of the motion sensor games. Furthermore, the higher the participants' PEC at the end of camp, the better their success of weight-loss 3-6 months after the camp had finished.
Our results suggest that feeling capable of exercising is key to successful weight loss for obese children, and that the more overweight children are, the less capable of exercising they feel. Our motion sensor games seem to have helped children feel more capable of exercising, thereby improving their chances of successful weight loss and better health.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings demonstrated the efficacy of the games in encouraging exercising and engagement from attendees of the Grace Eyre Centre for adults with Learning Disabilities. Because of this, the games are continuing to be used, and there are plans to use them more in the future. They could be adopted by other service providers who cater for adults with learning disabilities.

Our findings also demonstrated the efficacy of using the games to encourage exercise for a population of obese children. We used these findings to inform work that we are doing with a group of obese children in Qatar; we have developed online games that encourage healthy behaviours as well as a platform for virtual world lifestyle education to take place. We are also investigating how capable this group feel of being able to exercise, to further explore the link between perceived exercise capability and exercise, and how this can be changed with technology-driven intervention.

In our subsequently awarded EPSRC project 'Quantified-self for obesity...' (EP/L023814/1), we hope to build on our results linking psychological, physical (BMI) and behavioural factors in investigating the link between exercise and weightloss with a large sample of obese adults.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>45A3C8B0-66F4-4F85-AB84-419D776847CB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54736774e24562.67513148</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We systematically constructed a scale designed to measure children's perceived capability, opportunity and motivation to exercise.
