In much of my writing over the course of the past ten or fifteen years, I have attempted to contribute to this 'dissident' formation within postcolonial studies. In general, I have joined other 'dissident' scholars in the field in arguing that it is necessary to rethink the framing assumptions and common understandings that have guided postcolonialist scholarship over the past twenty-five years, in order to render it accountable to the realities of the contemporary world system. \n\nIn my current research project, the aim is to move from the 'negative' moment of critique to the more 'positive' moment of reconstruction. While it still seems to me necessary to problematise some of the predominant categories and theoretical understandings in the field (those concerning the notion of representation and the idea of 'the west', for instance), and to challenge the ways in which the work of some key theorists has conventionally been taken up (I focus on Fredric Jameson, Edward W. Said, and Frantz Fanon), I am concerned at the same time to propose alternative readings and conceptualisations to be set alongside and compared with those currently prevailing. Much of my study is therefore devoted to an elaboration of concepts, methods, and substantive themes upon which a plausible 'reconstruction' of postcolonial studies might be based. \n\nI have spent a great deal of time over the course of the past decade reading as widely as possible across 'postcolonial' and 'world' literatures in order to develop as deep an archive / as broad a canvas / as possible. My project centrally involves deploying this archive as a substantive and theoretical resource to challenge the tendentiousness and partiality of the assumptions and insights that have structured postcolonial studies hitherto. My argument in the project relies upon critical readings of literary works / both 'close readings' and, following Moretti's recent commentaries on the idea of world literature, 'distant readings' / informed by materialist assumptions as to the social determination of culture. I am particularly interested in recent theoretical work exploring the singularity of literature, which asks the question of what literature is able to do that other forms of cultural practice (and more generally other forms of social practice) cannot.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-07-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37819</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This 'project' was not designed to 'find' anything. I was funded to complete a monograph: the central argument of this monograph was that there has been -- and remains -- something of a 'disconnect' between what 'postcolonial' literature (considered in the round) has tended to show and what scholars working in postcolonial literary studies have tended to devote most of their attention to. I attempted to explain how this 'disconnect' should have come about -- it is in this context that I developed the idea of a 'postcolonial unconscious' -- and suggested that it would be a good idea for postcolonial studies to take its pulse from the themes and issues central to 'postcolonial' literature. In the substantive chapters of the book, I set out to propose some new directions for postcolonial literary studies to follow.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4B2F41B0-5B6B-4840-8CE5-315086EC1EE2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8611563033.06255777801cec</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D572B64F-3423-4725-BB47-35529397565E</gtr:id><gtr:title>'World Literature and Combined and Uneven Development'.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ddd8108535d7a5441b26a5f3e3682d0"><gtr:id>7ddd8108535d7a5441b26a5f3e3682d0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haroon Chowdry (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>r_121215351363ed3b10</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F5817A4-E345-4D46-BB8A-50F5E2F4B239</gtr:id><gtr:title>The pitch of the world: cricket and Chris Searle</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Race &amp; Class</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1d9b201084c924d5e3f710ccd22e0ca4"><gtr:id>1d9b201084c924d5e3f710ccd22e0ca4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Westall C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d079079a4904d3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A17CF75E-5F45-4331-AAA3-EB7E58C07B42</gtr:id><gtr:title>Global Modernisms</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e2a82578b70b1798aecf59df9328d056"><gtr:id>e2a82578b70b1798aecf59df9328d056</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Neil  Lazarus (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_309466922713ba6fe0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G008639/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
