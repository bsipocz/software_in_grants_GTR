Manufacture</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L01730X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Material-cell interface, which strongly depends on surface and materials properties, can augment cell growth and is extremely useful in enabling exquisite control of cellular manufacturing. We will address challenges related to the total efficiency of the cell production process starting with nature-inspired manufacture of bespoke green nanomaterials (GN), characterizing these nanoparticles, and evaluating how these materials affect the subsequent cell manufacture. As part of this call, we seek limited proof-of-concept funding 2 years. 
 
In order to manufacture green nanomaterials for efficient cell manufacture, there are following challenges:
- Can we scale up green nanomaterial manufacture so as to be competitive?
- How can we control flow to control manufacturing?
- Can we showcase the application of green silicas for cell manufacture?
- What nanoscale properties make green silicas superior?
We will address these challenges from a unique perspective by collaborating across non-traditional disciplines involving nanomaterials chemistry, fluid dynamics, cell manufacturing and nanotechnology, and combining expertise from two EPSRC Centres for Innovative Manufacturing and two EPSRC Manufacturing Fellows. 
 
We have shown that GN, which provide an environmentally friendly approach, are scalable and have promising biomedical applications, while establishing the importance of mixing in nanomaterials scale-up operations. We have also identified strategies to efficient and automated cell manufacturing and developed nano-probes to extensively investigate surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale. In this project, we aim to build on this success and go significantly beyond to address a number of key challenges to deliver large scale manufacturing of green nanomaterials suitable for cellular manufacture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>149657</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oxford Instruments Asylum Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>WAFT Industrial Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>8E0C3CCB-7345-424A-9185-3E2CAAF001B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Industrial Advisory Board Meeting with Science Meeting was held in October 2015 with 33 delegates.

However, we have found that our results are not easily reconciled with other methods of measuring charge in dispersed bulk liquid emulsions. We have since extended to technique to measure surfaces on 2D monolayers, and have some really unique results with them published in papers collaboratively with groups that create 2D materials.

The technology is completely revolutionary, as it can achieve all of the following:
? Extremely high resolution, with pixel sizes of sub-100 nm already demonstrated (compared to several micrometers for the best current technology).
? Capable of very deep colour hues matching and even exceeding the range of colours possible by the latest technologies in displays
? Can be clearly viewed in bright lighting conditions
? Eye fatigue minimal as displays similar to paper
? Very low power similar to electrochromic displays
? Extremely high speed switching capable of video rendition in reflective mode, and even holographic displays possible as switching speeds are much lower than microseconds.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d70717717858.65242713</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.bodletechnologies.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2015</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1EE3D3CD-D295-49DC-9B88-1782699B8633</gtr:id><gtr:title>Controlled preferential oxidation of grain boundaries in monolayer tungsten disulfide for direct optical imaging.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS nano</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4b526d5f418d9ba8421a2bf1f17c8725"><gtr:id>4b526d5f418d9ba8421a2bf1f17c8725</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rong Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1936-0851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d16346e541b3.23350475</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6958026-1412-4AE4-A893-36C15566DA3A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Scaling Limit of Graphene Electrodes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nano Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/630ae43fcf0e990aa4faec06975e9076"><gtr:id>630ae43fcf0e990aa4faec06975e9076</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Syed Ghazi Sarwat</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bfeff53d4302.26762312</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>15E9CC10-9EC9-4F2C-AB82-759C9D757DB8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Direct Catalysis Driven Manufacture of graphene-Coated Atomic Force Microscope Tips</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8e4dd3bcfc5131c7a416c57b081fdffe"><gtr:id>8e4dd3bcfc5131c7a416c57b081fdffe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pacios Pujado M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d7472bc537f1.08338284</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>43796D01-BB84-4C14-BEF2-45E1D364CC9D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Piezoresistive transduction of graphene-based nanoelectromechanical systems</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f7426e9c78454591a2e03b55596b0411"><gtr:id>f7426e9c78454591a2e03b55596b0411</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Madhav Kumar</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bee26b2f62b9.89987068</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4D7D1B61-2699-4FAC-B954-7B810788EC59</gtr:id><gtr:title>An optoelectronic framework enabled by low-dimensional phase change films</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/17c771f1225fb9636a861c8cdaaab27a"><gtr:id>17c771f1225fb9636a861c8cdaaab27a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harish Bhaskaran</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bee192b555c1.90638045</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>41FCC572-EF81-4151-88B7-56B2C9570AE0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reflective Displays - Are Phase Change Materials the New Modulator?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b328cc064483816aa6067f2750e54b62"><gtr:id>b328cc064483816aa6067f2750e54b62</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>P.
