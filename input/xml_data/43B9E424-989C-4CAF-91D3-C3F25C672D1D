Reading is a necessary component of many of our everyday activities (for example, reading a magazine, understanding a utility bill), and thus difficulties with this task are likely to be detrimental to an individual's quality of life. Such difficulties would also be likely to have severe economic implications for both an individual and wider society, as reading well is an essential skill for participating within modern working environments. It is thus of great concern that previous research has established that older adults (aged 65+) show slower reading speeds than young adults (aged 18-30). 

Much of what we know about age differences in reading has come from studying the movements of the eyes. During reading, the eyes make a series of jerky movements and pauses, which reflect the mental processes underlying this task. Previous studies have found that older adults are more likely to initially jump over words, but are also more likely to need to move their eyes backwards to re-read earlier portions of the text. This has previously been described as a &amp;quot;risky&amp;quot; reading strategy in which older readers may often subconsciously guess words (and thus jump over them), but frequently have to move their eyes back when these guesses prove wrong. However, at present there is little understanding of why these adult age differences in reading and eye movement control exist, and what steps can be taken towards alleviating the difficulties experienced by older adults. This project will explore these issues with the intention of more fully revealing the basis of these differences and to inform efforts to ameliorate the difficulties that older readers experience. 

The research will be split into three strands which will determine precisely how age affects the mental processes that are used to recognise words during reading, and how visual changes to a text may improve reading in older adults. The first strand will investigate whether the visual declines that occur in advanced age may lead older readers to confuse the letters within words and, consequently, experience difficulties with word identification. The second strand will ascertain whether age differences in word recognition processes and obtaining visual information from a text during reading are universal or specific to certain languages by exploring the reading behaviour of young and older Chinese adults. The third strand will investigate whether we can improve reading in older adults by examining the effects on reading performance of making simple visual changes to a text (e.g. font). Each of the experiments within these strands will record the movements of the eyes in order to obtain a detailed record of the mental processes that are occurring during reading.

The proposed research will achieve a greater understanding of adult age differences in reading, and of the measures that could be taken towards the alleviation of the difficulties experienced by older readers. The improvements in reading abilities that this research will generate will substantially enhance the quality of life within this age group, and would enable individuals to fully participate in the economic, cultural, and social aspects of everyday life during advanced age.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The population of the UK, and other leading economies, is rapidly expanding, and with this demographic shift comes an increasing need to consider the economic, social, and cultural wellbeing of older adults. Reading is an integral part of many everyday tasks, and thus the well-established difficulties that older adults experience in this task are likely to have profound implications for their welfare, and may lead to social exclusion. These difficulties are also likely to have significant economic implications for both older adults and society as a whole, as efficient and successful reading is of clear importance for participating in modern working environments. The proposed project will gain a greater understanding of these difficulties, and will explore methods through which these difficulties can be alleviated, in order to ensure individuals' wellbeing and ability to actively participate in society into advanced age.

In order to develop the ideas outlined in the proposal, key user groups, such as older adult community groups and organisations concerned with the wellbeing of older adults, were identified and contacted to initiate on-going dialogues to maximise impact both at the stages of conceptual development and dissemination. Discussions and solicited feedback from local groups of the University of the Third Age and the Women's Institute over the past 12 months, in addition to ideas inspired and developed through my previous work on a project funded by the Ulverscroft Foundation (an organisation which promotes the wellbeing of the visually impaired), were used to identify key research areas for which significant impact could be achieved. The input of these organisations has been integral in shaping the ideas outlined in this project, and this strategy of user engagement will be continued throughout the duration of the project. The pre-existing relationships with these organisations will be utilised throughout the project, both as a route for communicating the research outcomes, and through capitalising upon their links with other relevant organisations, such as Age UK and the RNIB, in order to further broaden impact.

The engagement of these user groups and organisations will be instrumental in helping the project to reach and improve the lives of its primary beneficiaries, the older adult community, who will benefit from the project through two clear routes of impact. Firstly, the project will broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying adult age differences in reading as, at present, little is known as to the causes of these difficulties and how they could be alleviated. Accordingly, the research will pave the way for research seeking to combat the difficulties faced by older readers, which would have a substantial impact upon older adults' wellbeing and their ability to participate in everyday activities. Secondly, the research will establish whether simple changes to the visual appearance of texts could be used to benefit the reading of older adults. As digital technologies could easily be used to implement the recommendations that will arise from these findings, the research will have important implications for how the recent technological advances and rise in popularity in accessing texts through digital mediums (e.g. e-readers, hand-held computers) could be used to benefit reading abilities in this age group. The findings will also be of considerable interest to companies and individuals associated with displaying texts digitally (e.g. manufacturers of digital reading devices), and for organisations directly involved in older readers use of technology, such as the Seniors Network Support, which is currently conducting pilot research into supporting and encouraging older readers in using digital reading devices. Engagement with such bodies will be pursued throughout the project to ensure the implementation of the findings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158162</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ulverscroft Foundation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D884BB5-E1EC-4C8B-A7A3-1B44985F857B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation was to the Ulverscroft Foundation, a charitable organisation who are allied to Ulverscroft Large Print Books.

1) As older adults (aged 65+) read they make risky decisions and so their eyes frequently jump past words without looking at them. These risky decisions are not due to older adults having particularly difficulties in identifying words in peripheral vision, or because of difficulties in controlling the eyes. Instead they may be part of a strategic response to compensate for the additional time taken to recognise words by increasing reliance on contextual information and by the guessing of upcoming words. This addresses fundamental questions about why reading changes during older age.
2) Older readers of Chinese have particularly difficulties in reading. This is not due to older Chinese adults finding unfamiliar words especially difficult, difficulties in processing information outside of central vision, or because of difficulties in reading text without spaces between words (as is the case for normal Chinese text). Modelling data suggests that older readers of Chinese are slower to recognise words than young Chinese adults, but unlike older readers of English are not able to compensate for this by using a risky strategy. Further research that will be conducted during this project aims to uncover precisely why this is the case. These findings will address key questions about how different writing systems may cause particular difficulties for older readers. 
3) Older readers perform particularly poorly when text is difficult to see, such as when words are presented in low contrast (e.g. light grey text against a white background), or when the spacing between letters is very small. These findings indicate that the typographical properties of text can have a substantial impact on the reading performance of older adults, and so particular attention needs to be given to ensure that text is accessible to older readers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Firstly, the results indicate that even very simple visual changes to a text (such as increasing contrast, or providing sufficient space between letters) could be of enormous benefit to older readers. Given that much of the text that is encountered in daily life (such as in magazines, advertisements) is not well suited to the visual requirements of older readers, these results suggest that there is much scope for implementing very simple changes to the appearance of text in order to improve accessibility. Secondly, the results show that reading may be especially difficult for readers of other languages, such as Chinese. Thus, the indication is that practical steps to ensure that people are able to read well during later life may be particularly vital for countries in which these languages are spoken.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>01C07A58-3656-4A34-AA15-F2FA894C4E72</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d82579b3ff46.55391890</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0651C895-62F3-49EF-8339-A8E8432CF236</gtr:id><gtr:title>The &amp;quot;Risky&amp;quot; reading strategy revisited: New simulations using E-Z Reader.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3b3d4747d20e840f8485dbe088b42990"><gtr:id>3b3d4747d20e840f8485dbe088b42990</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGowan, V.A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>589c40ddf20546.55605189</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>43AB70FC-7335-4644-84D9-9483D96DB03F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The &amp;quot;risky&amp;quot; reading strategy revisited: New simulations using E-Z Reader.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0c3065a6ac244216cb385ae49075fc30"><gtr:id>0c3065a6ac244216cb385ae49075fc30</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGowan VA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1747-0218</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcafb45b0e9.26849167</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>824E7FD8-98CE-4244-8BE8-CDD7E29C0F40</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aging and the optimal viewing position effect in visual word recognition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychology and Aging</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a8906dabc8bebc1f2b1c200ec165f98e"><gtr:id>a8906dabc8bebc1f2b1c200ec165f98e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li, L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>589c4022057e47.31639644</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E404F2D4-B2C2-4844-A844-02C8CEF4F452</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adult Age Differences in Eye Movements During Reading: The Evidence From Chinese.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The journals of gerontology.
