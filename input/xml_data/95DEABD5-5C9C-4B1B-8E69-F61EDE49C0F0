Scandals are especially undermining of any group that has made its claim to trustworthiness the foundation of its bargain with society. The patient-doctor relationship is in essence a principal-agent relationship; the institution of the medical profession is the basis on which patients are invited to believe that the risks inherent in such relationships will be resolved in their favour. The Medical Act (1858), which 
established the General Medical Council (GMC) and allowed it to maintain a list or &amp;quot;register&amp;quot; of recognised doctors, gave legal force to this bargain. It also granted the 
profession self regulatory powers. Three claims underpinned the self regulatory model for medicine: one of expertise, one of virtue, and one of control. Freidson
summarises these as follows: 
First, there is the claim that there is such an unusual degree of skill and knowledge involved in professional work that non professionals are not equipped to evaluate or 
regulate it. Second, it is claimed that professionals are responsible that they may be trusted to work conscientiously without supervision. Third [..] the profession itself 
may be trusted to undertake the proper regulatory action on those rare occasions when an individual does not perform his work competently or ethically. (1970:137) 
 
Thus, what Hughes terms the &amp;quot;social licence&amp;quot; for medicine went well beyond legal permission to carry out certain types of work, and involved the profession claiming 
and being granted a broad social, moral and intellectual mandate based on its own trustworthiness. It is questions about the trustworthiness of the profession, and the 
extent to which self regulation best serves the aim that individual members of the profession will be trustworthy, that have been at the heart of the scandals. 
 
The scandals (including those involving Harold Shipman, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Clifford Ayling, William Kerr, Michael Haslam, Richard Neale, Rodney Ledward, and 
others) appeared to suggest that the profession defaulted on its obligations to patients, the public, the NHS, and the state. The nature of the misconduct involved in the different scandals varied, sometimes involving unacceptable behaviour, and sometimes involving failures of performance (though these were sometimes inextricably linked) but all suggested that the profession could not be trusted to 
exercise the proper control over doctors who were 'bad apples'. 
 
Why did the scandals occur? 
 
My analysis suggests that the Inquiry reports tended to locate much of the blame for the scandals in the professional self regulatory model. Some of the reasons for this 
lay in the rise of an unsympathetic critique of the professions across a variety of disciplines and settings. Historiographical sociology both in the UK and the US presented the professionalisation project as primarily concerned with restriction of entry, and motivated predominantly by economic considerations, including a search 
for market shelter.3 This view was increasingly shared during the 1980s and 1990s by a range of different commentators and political actors, who now saw the professions 
as lobbies or pressure groups fighting to preserve and pursue their own interests rather than carrying some special imprimatur. Political scientists from the rational 
choice school were, for example, highly sceptical of the claims to professionalism that liberated doctors from external control, while neo liberal critiques of the professions similarly saw credentialing and licensing as simply attempts to collect 
monopoly rents. Alongside these critiques, the compact between the state and the professions came under severe strain during the early 1980s, as the new public 
management ideology, with its scepticism about professional motives, was embraced. 
 
Such an account tends to leave unexplained the motives of the state in granting the largesse of professional status and self regulation in the first instance. The historian 
Irvine Loudon argues that it is not incompatible to understand the 1858 Act as aspiring to serve the interests of the profession and those of the public, a view also 
supported by Roberts' recent analysis, 5 and understandable within a climate of mid nineteenth century opinion that saw professional self interest as the best guarantee 
of a good public service. Over 100 years after the Act was passed, the Merrison Inquiry, set up in the 1970s to investigate the regulation of doctors, was to describe 
the relationship between the profession and the public as one of 'mutual advantage'. The interest of the state, I propose, was in securing safety: the social contract in which the profession was granted the privileges of self regulation was in 
return for its fulfilment of fiduciary responsibilities, and can at least in part be understood as an early example of consumer protection, providing an apparently 
neat solution to the principal agent problem. 
 
The reasons why self regulation failed to control the behaviour of 'bad apples' had, I argue, much less to do with purposeful, interest driven efforts at occupational 
enhancement than with the weakness of social control inherent in the model adopted by the medical profession. This model assumed that the profession would 
be populated only by good people. It further assumed that each fully qualified member was equal in authority, self directing and self disciplined, and would be 
sufficiently conditioned by the norms acquired from her peers, socialisation into the profession and her own conscience to conduct herself well and competently. The 
consequences of this were far reaching, manifesting at GMC level in guidance on the standards of proper behaviour that was only vaguely formulated, and preoccupied 
with how doctors should treat each other rather than with their conduct towards patients. In keeping with the subject positioning of doctors as by definition and inclination 'good', there was no active system of monitoring doctors' performance or conduct, and no inspectorate either by the GMC or the NHS. 
 
The idealised public character offered to every person admitted to the medical register functioned as a veil under which 'bad' doctors could perform or behave very 
poorly. The institutionalised claim of goodness powerfully shaped social relations, such that even raising questions about the technical competence or the moral 
character of individual doctors was enough to risk the character of the complainer - 
whether doctor, patient, or manager. It was often dangerous, or at the very least extremely uncomfortable, to raise concerns about a doctor, especially for colleagues 
of that doctor. Thus, a striking finding of the Inquiries was the extent to which particular individuals knew, or had strong reasons to suspect, that their colleagues 
were engaged in misconduct, but were fearful of acting. 
 
This operation of the 'rule of anticipated reaction' to raising concerns was strengthened by the official standard for misconduct, which was, as the scandal Inquiries indentified, set unreasonably high. For much of its lifetime, the GMC 
confined its remit to cases of serious professional misconduct (SPM); formal procedures were therefore activated only for dealing with the most extreme end of misconduct. What counted as misconduct also, until recently (1995), reflected a 
belief that no doctor's clinical performance could be called into question. Further, determining that a doctor was guilty of misconduct required a criminal standard of 
proof, but many of the suspicions that people had about bad apples were difficult to turn into hard evidence. Even when there was good evidence a doctor's conduct was 
unacceptable, the Inquiries repeatedly highlighted the GMC's failures to take meaningful action. The perception that interests of the GMC had become misaligned 
with those of patients and the public did much to damage its legitimacy as a regulator. 
 
But any account of the phenomenon of bad apples in medicine needs to recognise the broader institutional context. What Rudolf Klein describes as the 'politics of the 
double bed' meant the NHS was itself in a principal agent relationship with the profession. All of the reports found weak NHS systems that tolerated misconduct 
and poor practice. There was no systematic mechanism for monitoring the clinical performance of healthcare professionals. Patients' complaints were often 
ineffectively dealt with, and concerns were not investigated or properly addressed. Managers lacked clarity about who was in charge and on what authority, were often 
unsure what to do about problem doctors, and felt unable to act unless they received a complaint from a patient. They also recognised that any disciplinary efforts would be arduous, time consuming, uncomfortable, and prone to failure. 
 
It is, however, important to recognise also that there is little that is specific to the medical profession or the NHS about the tendency for organisational actors to discount signals of incipient disaster; it has been found across many organisations in many settings, from railways to space. 

Responding to the scandals 
 
The scandals seriously undermined the medical profession's own claims to respect from the public, self regulation, and autonomy. But they also had very adverse 
effects for the profession's partner in the regulative bargain: the state, or more specifically, the government, for whom the scandals were a huge and ongoing political embarrassment. It was evident that the 'bargain' had failed. I propose that 
a useful way of understanding the scandals is to see them as provoking a new recognition of professionals as a source of risk, rather than an assurance of safety. 
 
Doctors became recognised as a source of risk in three ways. First, the work they do is inherently risky, and has a natural inclination towards catastrophe. The scandals 
destabilised the claim that the system of professional regulation was sufficient to ensure that all doctors would have the proper level of expertise to defend against 
the risks of clinical work. Second, professionals can be 'bad people' who purposely cause harm to occur. The moral claim - that doctors will reliably put their patient's interests first - was thus challenged. Third, they are a source of reputational risk, capable of causing embarrassment to the institutions that employ them and to political institutions. The politically embarrassing nature of the scandal, and the ways 
in which they exposed the government to suggestions that it was not in control of the services it provided, made reform an imperative. 
 
The reforms targeted the self regulatory model for a number of reasons. First, the historical evidence (e.g. responses to scandals in the 1960s involving medical research) may have suggested that simply re emphasising the duties and ethical 
responsibilities of doctors would be ineffectual. Second, the GMC appeared to be in a state of institutional sclerosis by the early 2000s, and was judged not to have 
responded effectively to the level of concern being expressed (evidenced, for example, in its proposals for revalidation, which were rejected). Third, removal of privileges helped in enacting a narrative of breach, fall, and punishment of an elite group. Fourth, strong pressures of institutional isomorphism were coming to bear. 
The model of a self regulating profession, with a huge governing council mostly elected by the profession itself and with little external accountability, was looking 
increasingly old fashioned and not fit for purpose. 
 
The effort to make the profession more governable has focused on challenging the traditional agent based model of professional practice, and on moving to a more 
highly contractualised regulatory model where powers of setting standards, monitoring of practice, and management of defaults from standards are largely relocated from inside to outside the profession. This new emphasis on seeing quality of clinical care and aspects of professional conduct as requiring external regulation, and as not being solely the dominion of the profession, was evident in the early 
proposals for clinical governance and subsequent establishment of regulators and quasi regulators including the Care Quality Commission, NICE, the National Patient 
Safety Agency, and others. The introduction of referral and remediation services for doctors, including the National Clinical Assessment Service, for instance, involved 
colonising a role the profession might previously considered its own. 
 
Recent reforms have accelerated this trend, and taken together, have resulted in the end of the self regulatory model. The GMC now has parity of lay and registrant 
members, and all are now selected by the Appointments Commission;the standard of 
proof is now civil rather than criminal; the GMC's functioning is overseen by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence; new procedures and policies for acting 
on concerns about doctors and responding to complaints have been introduced; and all doctors who wish to remain on the register will now have to be 'revalidated'. 
Trust and regulation 
 
Questions now arise about how effective these reforms will be, both in promoting good behaviour by doctors; in preventing, detecting, and dealing with poor 
behaviour and practice where it occurs; and in restoring trust. In addressing these questions, it is important to emphasise the apparent paradox that, though one of the 
central legitimising tropes of the reform programme has been a crisis of public trust in the medical profession, in fact the evidence for erosion of public trust is very thin. 
Survey data suggests that trust in the medical profession has consistently remained very high - the highest of all professions - and has remained so throughout the 
scandal filled era. Indeed, our analysis of why people cooperate with medical research indicates that doctors act as guarantors of the propriety of medical research, because doctors are seen as trustworthy. The rather counter intuitive 
finding of trust in the profession - despite the scandals needs to be explained. My work suggests that there may be important distinctions that are not always well 
recognised between the ways in which people orient towards medicine as an institution, and the ways in which they orient towards individual members of the profession. 
 
The analysis we conducted of the evolutionary dynamics of trust in primary care suggests that what we term 'initial trust' in doctors is institutionally structured, deriving from strongly reinforced social roles and identities ascribed to doctors and 
patients. Initial trust is a pragmatic position from which to begin, but is not blind or na?ve; rather, it is a handy heuristic that provides a necessary starting point for a 
relationship, and is provisional and contingent. Everyday direct experiences may be most relevant to patients' judgements of the trustworthiness of any individual 
doctor, while surveys of attitudes may be little more than descriptions of the social norms attached to the professional role. Reports of 'trust in the profession' should 
therefore not be interpreted as evidence that patients find all doctors trustworthy. 
 
Our analysis, drawing on game theory, also found that that it is direct experiences and the opportunity for repeated interactions that allow the role of the doctor as the 
trusted agent to be validated, not the detail of contractual or regulatory arrangements. However, my work on regulation of medical research also indicates that people demonstrate a generalised reliance on regulation as a feature of 
everyday life, and the assumed existence of regulatory structures and systems provides important forms of reassurance. The detail of these systems may not 
matter very much to patients until something goes wrong. 

Regulation and its consequences 
 
I argue that the troubles of the medical profession can be more appropriately understood as a crisis of legitimation rather than a crisis of trust. The relationship 
between specific regulatory forms and the extent to which people see the profession as trustworthy, or trust individual doctors, is likely to be tenuous at best. What is 
clear is that the scandals left both the government and the profession unable to demonstrate that the practical functioning of the regulatory system for doctors 
fulfilled the aims for which it was instituted. The self regulatory approach may have had a number of advantages. In particular, this kind of trust based model involved 
relatively low transaction costs and a minimum of regulatory overhead, and the high expectations of members may have been powerfully motivating to many, perhaps 
even most, doctors. But it was remarkably ill suited to dealing with defaulters - those who were unable, unwilling or indifferent to delivering on the commitments to 
high standards of performance and conduct. The reforms can be seen both as a response to this empirical problem, but also as an attempt to manage the associated 
institutional risks.
 
The turn towards a contractual form of regulating the profession requires empirical evaluation outside the scope of my fellowship. However, my work has identified 
several key themes that will need to be addressed in regulating doctors in the UK. 
 
First, there is a need for far more attention to the organisational context in which medical work takes place. There is a need for recognition of the complexities of the 
networks in which doctors are embedded, and of how alternative conceptions of what is 'safe' or 'good practice' may prevail, conditioned by coping with competing 
priorities, clinical uncertainties, organisational pressures, resource inadequacies, and perceptions of professional role. My analysis of ethnographic studies of patient 
safety suggests that at least some apparent violations of safety practices occur because of organisational stress (such as insufficient capacity). It is important not to 
mistake adaptive practices adopted by groups to deal with these strains for the dispositional traits of individuals. It is also important to understand the strongly 
norming effects of the environments in which doctors work, and to think about how more cooperative and participative forms of regulation can promote desired behaviour, rather than relying too heavily on rule based, surveillance or command and control type regimes. 
 
Second, there is a need to think very carefully about how to manage clinician behaviours where there is deemed to be a need to modify them. A common response to the discovery of problems in medical workplaces is to propose the 
introduction of formal rules (such as checklists and protocols) to render practice more orderly and accountable. But while it may be relatively easy to identify normative aspirations for safety at the level of broad principle, converting them into 
formal standards in such a way as to deliver on the desired objectives is very hard. 
My work on checklists shows that efforts to improve safety therefore need to be designed to take account of the realities of practice, and based on an understanding 
of the logics people are using to inform their practices. Interventions also need to enjoy broad organisational support; checklists are likely to be properly effective only 
when organisational fitness is addressed at the same time. Using checklists as standards of accountability against which doctors' performance will be assessed may 
prove problematic. 
Third, the exercise of clinical judgement presents significant dilemmas. On the one hand, clinical expertise and discretion are clearly needed to do the job of doctoring 
well, and to avoid stupidities and risks associated with rigid rule adherence and other unwanted consequences. On the other hand, claims of special knowledge and 
immunity from standardisation and conformity with rules can be self interested. 
Generalised non conformity may be a way of performing a particular kind of professional identity and reinforcing occupational boundaries. Doctors may seek to 
display their autonomy and seniority by demonstrating that they are not docile, but rather are creative, intuitive, and individual. A view that 'rules do not apply to us' 
may, however, easily become dysfunctional, extending to all kinds of areas where variations in professional judgement are irrelevant to the matter at hand, and used 
to legitimate or obscure poor practices. A highly sophisticated approach, based on a thorough understanding of clinical and organisational realities, is needed to inform 
work in this area. 
 
Fourth, there is a need to recognise the enormous number of regulatory forces now at work on doctors. Technology as a regulatory modality is just one of these, and a 
careful comparison with the theoretical literature on the use of technology as a way of controlling criminal behaviour reveals the need for caution and reflection before 
accepting what appear to be straightforward and commonsense solutions. A range 
of other regulatory agencies and regulatory tools have also been directed at increasing control over aspects of quality, professional decision making, and surveillance of professional activity and performance. Targets and their 
measurement have proliferated. Market like incentives, including the Quality and Outcomes Framework, have been introduced in several areas, while the courts are 
involved through their adjudication on negligence claims. There is a need to be sensitive to the number and variety of these regulatory forces, to identify how they 
interact and where they may conflict, and to explore which are perceived as most influential and why. 
 
Fifth, many of the new regulatory measures aim to detect (and potentially expel) renegades who fail to cooperate with the norms and standards expected of members of the profession on the basis of 'warning signs' (such as complaints from patients or colleagues or evidence of substandard performance). However, warning signs may be understood as an essentially contested concept: one where securing 
agreement on the broad principle (e.g. 'doctors should be good') is easy, but how to determine whether any particular instance meets the criteria, and who should own 
the definition of the situation, is very hard. The problem of how to ensure that concerns are indeed raised by colleagues and others is not yet well understood, and it is by no means clear that the sense of danger, threat, and discomfort associated with raising concerns has been diminished by recent reforms. The use of warning signs or other measures to control problematic doctors may also be subverted by 
tactics neutralising formal authority, including recourse to employment law, while individuals intent on malice may be especially skilful at evading detection. It is thus 
important to recognise that efforts to codify and formalise surveillance of doctors may interfere with informal peer based sanctioning, which, notwithstanding its weaknesses as a sole regulatory tool, may have highly productive and functional 
effects. There are also significant risks that the new revalidation processes may provoke ritualised displays of compliance, and have many unwanted and 
unnecessarily stifling effects on practice and performance, but persist in dealing ineffectively with the bad apple problem. There is a need for a substantial 
programme of empirical research in this area. 
 
This work, reported only briefly here, has raised many important questions. It is 
clear that there are inescapable tensions in designing a system to detect and suppress 'bad apples' at the same time as creating an environment in which 'good 
apples' are likely to flourish with a minimum of regulatory overhead. In addition to 
questions about optimal choice of regulatory strategy, it is also clear that a major rethinking of traditional sociological analyses of the professions (and the medical profession in particular) will be required.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Inform policy and practice e.g. at the level of the General Medical Council and other regulators.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22F46744-2541-45D2-85E2-EC7A718E1812</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54620b56ab9770.76605835</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4C84763D-FDDA-4AA5-B354-BE829F3BB8B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bioethics Around the Globe</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/99888180732223969981507cc7918b73"><gtr:id>99888180732223969981507cc7918b73</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ashcroft R, Dixon-Woods M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780195386097</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-1390420646.77031783b89ef5a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1FCC0FCE-4800-443E-A56F-F415408AB8B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Why is U.K. medicine no longer a self-regulating profession?
