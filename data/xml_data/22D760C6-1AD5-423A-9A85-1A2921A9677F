M. Carpenter Collection of Traditional Song and Drama as part of the Vaughan Williams Library's Digital Archive</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P01352X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The project will integrate the catalogue data and digitised resources of the J. M. Carpenter collection of traditional song and drama into the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library's (VWML) digital archive (currently known as The Full English). The Carpenter collection contains a wealth of folk songs, folk plays and other folk arts items, mostly gathered in England and Scotland in the period 1929-35 and including many early sound recordings. It has been little used for research or performance due to its accessibility.

This long-awaited project capitalises on its having already been catalogued and digitised and takes the opportunity to embed it within the VVWML's digital archive, already establised as a world-leading English-language folk arts resource. It will make the collection freely and internationally available to schools and their communities, young musicians, music tutors, folk arts enthusiasts, amateur and professional performers, researchers outside the academy, communities local to the places where the collection was made, contributor descendants, special interest groups (e.g. maritime heritage), arts, culture and heritage organisations, community groups and media. It will also enable cross searching with (currently) 22 other folk arts collections, to which it has many relationships in terms of items, forms, people, dates and places.

The Carpenter project team will work with the English Folk Dance and Song Society and the Elphinstone Institute, folk performers, tutors and contributor descendants to introduce the collection to a wide range of audiences with an interest in the folk arts and to promote it as an artistic and historical resource. This will result in discovery, supplementary information and knowledge exchange, creative responses such as performance, composition, artwork and writing, re-patriation of songs with the families of those who contributed them, and a coach tour of the landscape and communities which nurtured their performance in the 1930s.

The resulting resource will also go on to complement the Carpenter project team's forthcoming critical edition of the collection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will make a major multimedia folk arts collection (the bulk of which was gathered in locations around Britain in 1929-35) accessible to all those with a general or more specialist interest in traditional music and local culture. It will appear as part of an innovative 'super-archive' containing numerous related items, some collected from the same or related people and places some 30 years before, with which it can be cross-searched and compared via a single interface. Project activities will highlight the resource's artistic and socio-historical dimensions, producing creative responses to its materials in performances, and through educational projects exploring historical themes and narrative imagination. These will enrich family, community and regional heritage, widening participation in folk arts and deepening knowledge of their roots.

The beneficiaries of this project are schools and their communities, young musicians, music tutors, folk arts enthusiasts, amateur and professional performers, researchers outside academia, communities local to the places where the collection was made, contributor descendants, special interest groups (e.g. maritime heritage), arts, culture and heritage organisations, community groups and media. They will

- Gain access to the traditional songs (including ballads and sea shanties), folk (mummers) plays, fiddle tunes, customs, folktales, and children's games in the Carpenter collection
- Discover its content and compare it with other, related folk arts collections held in the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library's digital archive
- Use it creatively as an artistic and historical resource, for music-making and potentially for creative writing and drama
- Discover and share information about the contributors and their communities
- Become involved in intergenerational contact and exchange.

They will benefit because of the value of cultural traditions as examples of vernacular artistry which express identities and shape our sense of place, provide insights into everyday life in the past and inspire new interpretations and adaptations in the present.

The project will result in a considerable legacy (including an expanded and enhanced digital archive, supporting materials, and educational resources), all of which will be freely available online and available to users around the world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>63582</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P01352X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D417837F-1924-4F1E-875B-A160B88B4C98</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Traditional Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
