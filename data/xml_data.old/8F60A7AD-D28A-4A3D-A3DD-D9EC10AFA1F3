The CFR is &amp;quot;a set of definitions, general principles and moden rules in the field of contract law&amp;quot;. It is primarily intended as &amp;quot;a tool for better law making', which should guide the legislator. It could furthermore form the basis of directly applicable rules on contract law, perhaps in the form of an optional instrument. In the long run, it might even serve as the basis of a future European Civil Code. 
The present research proposal looks at the relationship between this CFR and the laws of EU member states, as exemplified by German and English law. It will look at how these rules will interact with the legal environment in which they are to operate. 
CFR rules will have to dovetail with domestic rules on contract law outside the scope of the CFR, and also with domestic property, tort and unjust enrichment law. They will have to work in the context of different procedural laws. The CFR will also serve as a yardstick for legislative and judge made contract law reform in the Member States, and will influence the interpretation of domestic contract rules. 
The proposal includes a case study on one particular use which could be made of the CFR. An optional instrument could allow e.g. consumers to choose CFR based rules for their electronic distance sales contract with a business by clicking on a &amp;quot;blue button&amp;quot;. The case study is to investigate on the wide-ranging repercussions this will have on other rules e.g. on jurisdiction, choice of law, property law, unfair competition law, and for collective proceedings for the control of standard terms</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>300875</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Drafting of the Common European Sales Law: an Assessment and Suggestions for Improvement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58F50F16-21D7-48C8-87EC-5AAC36444D97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The drafting of the Commission's current proposal for a CESL is analysed

The project was initially based on the Draft Common Frame of Reference for European Private Law ('DCFR'). Halfway through the project the European Commission published its proposal for an optional Common European Sales Law ('CESL'). At that stage we decided that it was more appropriate to publish our findings in a single volume rather than the two volumes originally suggested in our grant application which was based on the structure of the DCFR. We explained this shift of emphasis in our interim report to the AHRC dated 1 October 2010. 



We identified four different types of interaction:



(1) Application of CESL rules next to English, German or other domestic law as invoked by the Rome I or II Regulation, or other applicable conflict of laws rules. The way in which the proposed Regulation makes parties choose the CESL causes considerable interaction problems with rules on pre-contractual duties and form, but also a prolonged state of uncertainty as to whether the CESL or domestic law will apply. Other interaction problems can occur eg with unfair trade practice rules or collective proceedings against unfair terms. Different rules on pleading foreign law could likewise affect the uniformity of application of the CESL.



(2) Where the CESL uses open terms inviting value judgments, courts and scholars are likely to use this leeway to read their own domestic legal conceptions into European provisions. The CESL provisions on the control of unfair terms are a case in point. Various other examples can also be found.



(3) The extent to which the CESL will be accepted by contracting parties in different jurisdictions raises another interaction issue. If the seller (or buyer) believe their own domestic law to be superior, they will not sell (not buy) under the CESL. While much communality can be found, the CESL differs from both English and German law in a number of respects. This domestic law perspective may need some adjustment because in cross-border B2C transactions, neither seller nor buyer will be able to rely on a wholesale application of their own domestic law.



(4) The CESL and the DCFR can also interact with English and German law where they have model character for future legislative reform, or become used as common reference point for the interpretation and development of the law by European and domestic courts.



The findings will be published by Oxford University Press in a book comprising 22 chapters, each of them between 30 and 50 pages long. The expected date of publication is March 2013. The project has also generated and contributed to a number of further outputs which are listed on the AHRC website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be used by the legislative organs of the EU that are involved in the discussions surrounding the possible introduction of a European Contract Law instrument, ie the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CDB5BEC3-DB5E-4467-B0BF-758EEE3966F4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1161123077.53518577924854</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/projects/CESL</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>96C4D3E4-51DA-435B-806F-9039B116F211</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Common European Sales Law in Context: Interactions with English and German Law</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7eb4b2321c4a30c8a593936f35547094"><gtr:id>7eb4b2321c4a30c8a593936f35547094</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dannemann, Gerhard; Vogenauer, Stefan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-19-967890-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_97193525553bf6a988</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0A77ACA8-1DC4-4522-A03E-34DA4EFADC17</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contract Law: Ius Commune Casebooks for the Common Law of Europe</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d14bcebd38ec7ee7e153b0aa2da5232"><gtr:id>7d14bcebd38ec7ee7e153b0aa2da5232</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beale Professor Hugh</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781841136042</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_32230618293bf3b58e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B4727236-9C22-4B4B-9C82-8A3B570EBE8D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Common European Sales Law (CESL): A Commentary</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1de522c9b5301759f5f8b6632d766970"><gtr:id>1de522c9b5301759f5f8b6632d766970</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schulze, Reiner</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781849463652</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_73629003153bcaa6ee</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>76998B4D-3858-4114-A6F0-5392BE2E3B7A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Common European Sales Law (CESL): A Commentary</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1de522c9b5301759f5f8b6632d766970"><gtr:id>1de522c9b5301759f5f8b6632d766970</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schulze, Reiner</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781849463652</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_26976443753bcaa568</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F97FCC18-4CC8-4CF4-8F73-0A36022A8D87</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Cambridge Companion to European Union Private Law</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0f54f6f16d0f834c934f46cfec2e4614"><gtr:id>0f54f6f16d0f834c934f46cfec2e4614</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Twigg-Flesner, Christian</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780521736152</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_20561183813bca108a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50767A22-5FC8-420D-8421-04BF361A0C14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Practice and Theory in Comparative Law</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5d6a900dd0801badff28a5c11bfb8034"><gtr:id>5d6a900dd0801badff28a5c11bfb8034</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dannemann G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1107010857</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_266864826491d37d32</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H500154/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
