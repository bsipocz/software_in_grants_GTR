Defects in the process of neuron synthesis (neurogenesis) have been linked with various brain diseases, psychiatric illnesses and addictions. Neurogenesis is also critically involved in the repair of an injured brain. One type of cell, called radial glial cells (RGCs) can give rise to all types of neurons in the cerebral cortex of the brain but how this is controlled is not well understood. Recently, hormones, called oestrogens, have been indicated to play important roles in RGCs and in neurogenesis.

In this project we will apply genetically engineered zebrafish models to investigate the roles of oestrogen in neurogenesis and brain development, investigating also for sex related differences. We are using zebrafish for this work because of the relative ease to create transgenic animals and the fact that there is a high neurogenic activity in the brain throughout life. 

We have already successfully developed one genetically engineered (transgenic) zebrafish in which cells responsive to oestrogen produce a green fluorescent protein (GFP) that can be detected using imaging methods in living animals and in real time. Using this model we will establish the role of oestrogens in the RGCs in the telecephalon and identify the different cells in the brain responsive to oestrogens and how they develop. We will also apply a method called two-photon microscopy to selectively remove the oestrogen responsive RGCs in the telecephalon and investigate subsequent effects on brain development to help establish their function. 

We will then develop a new transgenic zebrafish model with a different genetic insert that prolongs the green fluorescent signal generated in response to oestrogen exposure. This will enable us to follow the fate of the oestrogen responsive RGCs and other neural cells of early life in the brain of juvenile and adult fish. We will also use this model to investigate for differences that occur between males and females.

We will develop a further, more complex (triple), transgenic zebrafish that will enable us to identify activity in oestrogen responding neurons. This model includes two fluorescent colours, red identifying oestrogen responsive neurons and green identifying when these cells are active (produced in response to increased levels of calcium in the cell). Using this fish we will investigate the roles of oestrogen responding neurons in smell, including assessing for sex related differences. We will also apply a technique to block oestrogen action responsive neurons in the telecephalon during early life to establish how this affects their subsequent development and function in smell.

Applying these transgenic models, finally we will initiate studies into the effects of exposure to so called endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), for which there is widespread health concern, on oestrogen responding neurons and their subsequent fate and function. 

The research will be significant interest to a diverse audience including academic and industry researchers, and the medical profession, by provision of new models to study neurogenesis and the roles of an important group of environmental chemicals on human health. It will also be of strong interest to industry and government regulatory bodies, as the models develop could be applied for advancing risk assessment of chemicals with oestrogenic activity, supporting evidence-based decision-making for those chemicals. The wider public will benefit also from this research from improved understanding of neurological conditions and better evidence of chemical effects that may affect their own health. The models developed will provide more integrative systems for chemical effects analysis with great potential for reducing the numbers of vertebrate animals used in testing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will apply an oestrogen responsive transgenic zebrafish model (developed at Exeter) and develop new transgenic models to investigate the roles of oestrogen in neurogenesis and brain development, investigating for sex related differences, including in intact animals in real time using advanced imaging methods. 

Specifically we will: 

1.) Apply our current transgenic zebrafish model (ERE- GFP) to establish the role of oestrogens in telencephalic radial glial cell (RGC) differentiation and function, identifying the different cell types in the brain responsive to oestrogens, their ontogeny, sensitivity and behaviours. The work will include ablation of oestrogen responsive neurones during early life using two-photon microscopy. 

2.) Develop a new transgenic zebrafish model [ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_GFP_KalTA4] and use this to follow the fate and behaviour of oestrogen responsive RGCs and other neural cells in juvenile and adult fish brains, investigating also for differences between the sexes.

3.) Create a further transgenic zebrafish [ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_ mCherry x UAS _GCaMP3] to identify neuronal activity in oestrogen responsive neurons. We will investigate the spatio-temporal activation of individual oestrogen responding neurons in the telecephalon associated with olfaction, including assessing for sex related differences. Oestrogen receptor morpholino knockdown will be applied to assess how oestrogen signal interference during early life affects subsequent telecephalon oestrogen responsive cell development and neuronal activity for olfactory stimuli.

4.) Apply our ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_GFP_KalTA4 transgenic model to investigate effects of exposure to a series of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on oestrogen responding neuronal progenitors and their subsequent fate. Also examine for effects of these EDCs on the neuronal activity of oestrogen sensitive telencephalic cells using the ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_mCherry x UAS _GCaMP3 transgenic line.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect our research findings and the new zebrafish models we develop will be of significant interest to academic and medical researchers working in similar or related fields by providing new zebrafish models for studies on understanding brain development and function and the roles of an important group of environmental (oestrogenic) chemicals on human health.The work will aso benefit industry researchers by providing new models for advancing risk assessment of chemicals with oestrogenic activity. Industry, government and government regulatory bodies may benefit from the exploitation of these models through better evidence-based decision-making for chemicals with oestrogenic action. The wider public will benefit from improved understanding of neurological conditions and better evidence of chemical effects that may affect their own health. 

Major impact activities will be centred on delivering high quality science, training, engagement with potential industry (and other) partners, and informing the wider public. 

Results of this work are expected to make a significant scientific impact and major routes for dissemination will be via relevant ISI scientific journals with open access, and national and international conferences and workshops. This will include a workshop we will run through the trans-channel LARC-neurosciences network (larc.neurosciences.org) and dedicated to supporting uptake of zebrafish models into other laboratories. The project team has a very strong track record in international research collaboration. 

Tyler has research associations with large organizations that include AstraZeneca, Syngenta, UK water companies, the Chemical Manufacturers Association, and various SMEs, who may seek to exploit the models we develop in this project. This is evidenced through a recently awarded BBSRC FLIP to Tyler and Kudoh with AstraZeneca to apply our oestrogen sensitive transgenic zebrafish to screen for oestrogenic activity of pharmaceuticals and facilitate molecular technology transfer. We will gain direct support on commercialisation opportunities for our new models, and be provided with advice on the protection of IP, through the University's Research &amp;amp; Knowledge Transfer section. CRT/TK has partnered KEP awards and has 5 current CASE (2 BBSRC) studentships, including for the development of new transgenic fish models. We will balance any possible commercial exploitation opportunities with our desire to make the new models widely available to academic researchers. 

We have a strong record in public engagement activities. The PI, Co-I and research co-I and other lab members will contribute to primary school visits and public University open days during the study, continuing current activity. These presentations will include how fundamental bioscience can be translated into applications that benefit us all and affects our daily lives. We will, with support from our Press Office, ensure that results are disseminated from our work in order to maximise publicity opportunities, in agreement with the policies of the BBSRC. Our work on endocrine disruption and zebrafish models has received considerable media attention and has featured in the national and international press, on television, and has been presented to The Royal Society, the House of Commons, the European Commission, and more globally via web bases (e.g. Webinar, Harvard University) and u-tube presentations. In 2011, Tyler's team's research won the University Exeter's Outstanding Achievement Award for its contribution to Policy and Public Services. 

The PI will be responsible for ensuring that impact activities are conducted, but Dr Takesono (Research co-I) will be expected to contribute substantially to these activities. Dr Takesono will receive training in a wide range of science disciplines, including interaction with industry, policy makers and the wider public, and in communicating science, enhancing her employment prospects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>467070</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Biosciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaborations with University college London and obtaining UAS-GCamp6f,m and s lines.</gtr:description><gtr:id>536756ED-9A27-4A3A-AC4B-4AD3C8957FE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publication in preparation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8029f74c8d2.86583756-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>provision of UAS-GCamp6f, m and s zebrafish lines.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing of knowledge on transgenic zebrafish systems</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Medical School</gtr:department><gtr:description>UEMS Dr John Chilton/Prof Andrew Randall</gtr:description><gtr:id>8E215DD3-E30D-43BA-8AAC-358A407AF5EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaborators conducted supporting experiments in neural electrophysiology.

(illustrating work that is still outstanding)
Work package 1: Investigate the role of oestrogens in neuronal progenitor cells differentiation in the telencephalon.
Outcome: Using our ERE-GFP zebrafish and imaging methods, we have established detailed ontogenic profiles of oestrogen responsive neuronal progenitors (ER-forebrain cells) for developmental stages of embryos/larvae up to 30 days post fertilisation. Via immune-staining we have confirmed that the ER-forebrain cells are SOX2 (a neuronal progenitor marker), aromatase B (a brain specific estrogen
synthesising enzyme expressing in radial glia cells) and GFAP (a glia marker) positive. We have shown that the earliest ER-forebrain cells occur from 28 hours post fertilisation (28 hpf) when they are located in the most dorsal layer of the olfactory bulbs. They subsequently increase in number and extend towards the posterior part of telencephalon up until 14 days post fertilisation (14 dpf). After this
life stage they become reduced in number (by 21 dpf). We have shown that at 10-14dpf there are two distinct groups of ERE-GFP larvae, that have either high or low numbers of ER-forebrain cells, and we are currently testing if this difference in the numbers of ER-forebrain cells relates to sex. Through histological analysis of the gonads of adults resulting from the larvae with either high or low numbers of ER-forebrain cells at 10-14dpf we will be able to establish whether these differences are encoded for (encode for) sex.
We planned originally to develop a laser cell ablation system using multiphoton microscope to investigate the roles of ER-forebrain cells in forebrain development. In this project however, we have adopted a more refined approach to ablate ER-forebrain cells, choosing instead to use a chemical/genetic approach, which utilises nitroreductase-mediated in vivo cell ablation, and sought to optimise the conditions for cell ablation (currently, we are able ablate around 50% of the ER-forebrain cells with no other obvious adverse animal effects). Our findings to date in this work indicate that the ablation of the ER-forebrain cells reduces the size of olfactory bulbs and may also affect length of axons and size of the termini of hemocyanin positive olfactory sensory neurons at a glomerulus. These data indicate that ER-forebrain cells in the olfactory bulb play an important role in the olfactory bulb development and development/differentiation of associated olfactory sensory neurons. However,
these conclusions are preliminary and we need to undertake more work to confirm this and we seek to do as part of our new grant application to the BBSRC.
Work package status: Completed, with the exception of histological analyses of gonad development to establish whether numbers of ER-forebrain cells at 10-14dpf encode for sex (commenced in Jan 2017). A research paper on this work will be submitted to e-Life within the next two months (Takesono et.al.).

Work package 2: Develop a new transgenic zebrafish model (ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_GFP_KalTA4) to study the fate of oestrogen responsive neuronal progenitors throughout life and establish sex related differences.
Outcome: We generated ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_GFP_KalTA4 line as set out in our original proposal. However, in this line we found that the original tissue specificities for oestrogen responses in the liver, muscle, heart and forebrain were not consistent with the original ERE-GFP line. Rather, the ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_GFP_KalTA4 line showed oestrogen independent spontaneous expression of GFP in other parts of the brain including the habenula, retina, and hindbrain. This was an unexpected result and may have resulted from a compatibility issue between the ERE and KalTA4. We have sought to overcome this problem through generating a completely new ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_Cre x Ubi_Zebrabow line which allows for permanent multicolour single cell labelling of oestrogen responding cells. We have made good progress here having completed the screening of heterozygous pairs of the ERE_Gal4f x Ubi_Zebrabow and we are currently analysing the cell fate of oestrogen responding cells using this model. To explore the possibility if ER-forebrain cells are involved with/contribute to sex differentiation, we are currently testing for associations between the numbers of ER-forebrain cells (at 10-14 dpf) and sex differentiation, as described in work package 1.
Work package status: A new transgenic line (ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_Cre x Ubi_Zebrabow) has been established and neural cell fate tracing analyses using this model is undergoing. This work will be completed by the end of May 2017.

Work package 3: Develop a second new, triple, transgenic zebrafish model (ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_mCherry x UAS _GCaMP3) to identify neuronal activity in oestrogen responsive neurons and investigate sex related differences.
Outcome: To visualise neuronal activity of ER-forebrain cells in real-time, we have successfully established an ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_mCherry x UAS_GCaMP6s line (a modified/latest version of UAS_GCaMP line) which will allows us to detect neuronal responses in the target cells of interest. Weaim to examine the neuronal activities of the identified ER-forebrain cells in response to amino acid mixture using light-sheet microscopy. We have recently established and optimised the imaging system for detection and quantification of GCaMP6 signals in zebrafish larvae and the ImageJ macro/ python pipelines for quantification of these for responses (Winter et al., 2017. Functional 4-dimensional neuropharmacological profiling in the vertebrate brain, submitted to e-Life).
Work package status: The new transgenic line - ERE_Gal4ff x UAS_mCherry x UAS_GCaMP6s - has been established and GCaMP imaging to establish neuronal activities of ER-forebrain cells will be completed by May 2017.

Work package 4: Initiate studies into the effects of exposure to oestrogen-mimicking chemicals on neuronal progenitor cell development and function.
Outcome: We have tested the effects of two EDCs, bisphenol A (BPA) and nonlyphenol (NP) on our transgenic zebrafsh models and found that ER-forebrain cells are responsive to these environmental oestrogens for early life exposures. NP, however, unlike for BPA, induce alterations in ER-forebrain cell development, markedly inhibiting the establishment of their projection networks, with also ectopic
distributions of the cell bodies. We have shown that these effects for NP are dose-dependent, with effects at exposure concentrations from 11.4mg NP/L in the water. NP did not alter the spatiotemporal expression of olfactory output neuron marker, lhx2 or tbx21, but impaired the innervation of ER-forebrain cells to lhx2 and tbx21 positive cells. We also found that NP markedly reduced the size of axonal termini of hemocyanin positive olfactory input neurons at glomeruli, as well as the size of the
olfactory bulb/forebrain. These findings highlight that NP exposure during early life has the potential to alter forebrain development, adding further concern about exposure to this EDC for wildlife (and human) health. T
