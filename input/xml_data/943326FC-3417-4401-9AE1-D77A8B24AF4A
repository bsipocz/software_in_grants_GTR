These will operate over different scales and complexities. Particular focus will be on finding low input optima for maximising productivity from perennial bioenergy crops whilst minimising costs and environmental impacts. Concepts established for arable crops are being expanded to biomass crops, e.g. rhizomatous grasses. Initially, emphasis is given to quantifying crop responses to water stress and temperature, and to evaluating different crop growth strategies (evasion, enhanced exploration, recycling of reserves).

The objective is to develop process-based models in perennial bioenergy crops (a) to quantify fluxes of energy, water and matter between the crops and their environment and (b) to describe phenotypic and physiological crop response to different environmental and climatic conditions. Specific objectives are (1) to implement models of sink-source regulation, above-belowground interaction, and morphological and plant architectural development, and (2) to use generic tools of model evaluation (sensitivity, uncertainty analysis) in aid to select phenotypic traits and (3) to simulate scenarios to quantify the crop response for different environments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>262184</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In breeding for higher biomass yields, it is important that high resource-use efficiency is maintained and that requirements for inputs such as water and nitrogen are not increased. The evaluation of new or existing varieties (phenotypes/genotypes) in different target environments cannot be done exclusively by experimental means. Experimental trials are particularly expensive and time-consuming in perennial crops which may take several years after first establishment to reach optimal yield potential in the field. Models can assist in optimizing the resource use and management and ultimately in reduce the impact on the environment. However, there are currently no process-based models that integrate above- and belowground dynamics with respect to C and N for biomass crops. Quantitative, process-based models will help to extend the spatial and temporal testing of genotypes (G) via scenario simulation (in silico) under different environments (E) and management (M). This will enable us to develop and test hypotheses and hopefully accelerate evaluating the G x E x M interaction to select/design crops with optimal resource utilization/capture.</gtr:description><gtr:id>ADDBF419-BB7B-421A-A15D-19329B631746</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544cebe7d7eae6.74925120</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A sink-source interaction model originally parameterized for Miscanthus x giganteus from literature data was evaluated using observations from a long-term experiment. Global Sensitivity Analysis was used to identify the relative importance of model parameters for sink and source related processes. Since the belowground resources had a large impact on shoot extension rate, the code of the grass model was expanded for belowground storage compartments, which interact with aboveground growth and could further affect the dynamics of tillering. For the parameterization of this link between above- and belowground growth several field plots were sampled to quantify rhizome growth according to phenological and morphological structure, chemical and physical properties as well as their vitality (tillering and extension rate). New data on rhizome quality and quantity gave some interesting insights into the impact of site fertility and nutrient (N) availability on belowground growth. A review of suitable models for development of a process-based SRC willow model was undertaken and progress has been made on developing a model for co-designing crop canopies for optimal light interception.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The models can operate over different scales and complexities and will help target breeding of perennial bioenergy crops with enhanced productivity and optimal resource use. They can also be used to in yield mapping exercises to determine the optimal siting of the crops for maximum productivity whilst minimising costs and environmental impacts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>027106A7-1841-43EE-95CA-EFDEF78FE40F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544ceb92d6aa72.11629926</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ACF9DF8E-E163-4446-9C03-51FA7AB64BBB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Estimating root biomass in
