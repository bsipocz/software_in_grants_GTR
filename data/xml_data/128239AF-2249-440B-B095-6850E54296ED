The series sought to create 'concentrated volumes out of a personal space that carries the memory of an absent self' (Gormley [1997] 2007). This is achieved in part through intimate measurements of physical bodies and in part through the distribution of these personal and monumentally public forms within buildings and landscapes. My project is inspired by and can be compared to his work in its examination of interconnections of architecture and self through sacred space and landscape in ancient Egypt. \n\nThroughout ancient Egyptian history, elite individuals commissioned significant monuments in order to celebrate and commemorate their lives and to ensure that their memory would endure and they would make a successful transition to the next world. These monuments included inscribed stone statues and stelae dedicated in temples as well as decorated tomb chapels. Although the majority of the monuments bore formulaic, standardized texts and images, in all periods smaller numbers thematized more personal, subjective components of self and biography. Even though these self-presentations are one of the most characteristic features of Egyptian high culture, they have rarely been analysed in context and in detail. Yet they offer a unique opportunity to examine the ways in which individuals fashioned distinctive selves for display and the significance of the physical and social contexts they selected.\n\nI focus on the late New Kingdom, Dynasties 19 and 20 (ca.1290-1075 BCE), a period of marked development in language, art, and religious expression, partly in response to the revolutionary changes during the reign of the 'heretic king', Akhenaten. This is a time when individuals' choices can be seen as particularly salient and highly charged. Through case-studies, I address how and why people made their selections for display and the significance of those selections for the transformation of high culture. The case-studies look at the setting of monuments in specific landscapes and architectural spaces, such as the temple and cemetery landscape of the West Bank at Thebes (modern Luxor) in Upper Egypt and the ritually charged setting of the sacred animal necropolis at Saqqara (near modern Cairo) in Lower Egypt. Locations like these provide clearly bounded contexts in which it is possible to compare different forms and motifs of self-presentation and to understand how elites both make use of different periods in the past and develop innovative forms. \n\nMy research develops new approaches to the interpretation of a broad range of elite materials from ancient Egypt, emphasizing the salience of landscapes and personal and group selection and engagement. Through its integrative, holistic method which encompasses built environments, media, images, and texts, this study will inform understanding of New Kingdom history and culture and highlight the extraordinary eloquence of the Egyptian sources for scholars of other ancient and pre-modern societies.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18392</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F013256/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology of Literate Soc.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
