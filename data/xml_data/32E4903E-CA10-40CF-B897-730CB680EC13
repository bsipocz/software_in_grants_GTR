This ecosystem will have as basis emerging information-/content-centric networking technologies which support intrinsic in-network content manipulation. The project will consider uncertainty aspects in the following two application domains: a) social media networks based on user generated content and b) CDN-like professional content distribution. Three dimensions of uncertainties will be addressed: heterogeneous and changing service requirements by end users, threats that may have adverse impacts on the content ecosystem, as well as opportunities that can be exploited by specific players in order to have their costs reduced.
 
In order to manage and exploit these uncertainty aspects, CONCERT defines a two-dimensional content and network adaptation framework that operates both cross-layer and cross-player. First, the decision on any single adaptation action needs to take into account context information from both the content application layer and the underlying network. Second, we consider joint content and network adaptation in order to simultaneously achieve optimised service performance and network resource utilisation. Finally, some complex uncertainty scenarios require coordinated content and network adaptation across different ecosystem players. In this case, inconsistent or even conflicting adaptation objectives and different levels of context knowledge need to be reconciled and are key research issues.

In order to achieve adaptation solutions capable of coping with these different uncertainties, the project will develop advanced learning, decision-making and negotiation techniques. Learning is required for deriving accurate system behavioural patterns according to the acquired context knowledge. This will then drive decision-making functions for taking the most appropriate adaptation actions to address these uncertainties. Negotiation techniques are required for resolving potential tussles between specific content/network adaptation objectives by different players in the content ecosystem. The project will consider both centralised and distributed approaches in which learning and decision-making processes on adaptation actions can be performed either at the central adaptation domain controller or in a decentralised manner across multiple network elements. In the latter case, emerging information-/content-centric networks will become much more intelligent, with content-aware devices performing self-adaptation according to their own context knowledge but through coordination in order to achieve global near-optimality and stability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>264164</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Some of the research items are directly associated with the 5G research and innovation (5GIC) activities at the University of Surrey since the beginning of the CONCERT project.

By February 2017, the implemented prototype has been demonstrated to a wide variety of audiences, such as:
? Industry companies, including 5GIC partners such as BT, O2, BBC, Huawei, Fujitsu, and also other industry visitors including Nokia and Ericsson. 
? The European Telecommunications Standardisations Institute (ETSI) Next Generation Protocol (NGP) Industry Specification Group during their visit in January 2017.
? UK and China government officials (including the Chinese Vice Premier Mr. Ma Kai during his visit to 5GIC in November 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>50EAAC4D-039E-4A33-9794-43B9B074DC01</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461d70289bc26.95270329</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The UNIS team have mainly been focusing on the following topics in CONCERT:
? Extension of previously designed CAINE (Context Aware Information-centric Network Ecosystem) scheme towards a holistic end-to-end platform for smart video content delivery use case
? Context-aware Information centric networking (ICN) for Peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery, and
? Quality of Experience (QoE) aware video adaptation and delivery in future 5G mobile networks.

The key principle of CAINE is to natively associate context information to content objects without disclosing conditions of any intermediaries in the content delivery chain, such as content servers and network elements. The research team has been trying to shed light on the efficiency and limitations of using bloom filters for disseminating aggregated context information, as compared to the traditional host-to-host model in which context information on involved intermediaries needs to be explicitly disclosed. Currently the research team is prototyping the scheme based on the NDN platform for supporting context-aware DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) video resolution and transmission functions.

Early in the project we proposed an intelligent in-network caching scheme for P2P content chunks, aiming to reduce P2P-based content traffic load and also to achieve improved content distribution performance. Towards this end, the proposed solution uses holistic decision-making logic and takes into account context information on the P2P characteristics such as chunk availability and popularity. In addition, we have analysed the benefit of coordination between neighbouring content routers when making caching decisions in order to avoid duplicated nearby P2P chunk caching. An analytical modelling framework has been developed to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of the proposed in-network caching scheme.

Since the beginning of Year 3, the UNIS team also started the investigation of QoE-aware mobile video delivery in LTE-A based environments (Joined work with another EPSRC KCN Project - EP/L026120/1). This is in the context of the 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC) research activities hosted at UNIS. The key idea is to leverage on Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to build an intelligent virtual mobile edge which is able to perform context-aware video prefetching and adaptation operations according to different dynamicity on the user side and the network side. Extensive experiments have been carried out based on a real campus-wide LTE-A testing infrastructure at 5GIC, and the results proved the feasibility of successful transmission of QoE-assured 4K video (subject to the availability of radio resources) from any remote video sources in the public Internet up to 300ms round-trip-delay (RTT), which cannot be achievable by any existing schemes due to the behavioural limitation of the TCP transport protocol.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The aforementioned research items are directly associated with the 5G research and innovation activities at the University of Surrey since the beginning of the CONCERT project.
