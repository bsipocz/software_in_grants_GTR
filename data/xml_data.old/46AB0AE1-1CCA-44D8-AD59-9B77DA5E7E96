The approach will be to inform, entertain and inspire the audience by providing the opportunity to do hands-on experimental and observational science during both residential and open access (public) events. Under the banner of the STFC-LGFC Education Hub, this project will build and sustain a team of volunteers who will deliver residential workshops and public access events in STFC key subject areas of astronomy, particle physics, solar system and space science and sustainable energy to facilitate public awareness of STFC science projects.

To support the LGFC volunteer team we will establish a network of external experts in the key STFC subjects who will contribute at workshops and experimental/observational events held the STFC-LGFC Education Hub. We will draw on expertise from the academic community in northern England, particularly those engaged in STFC projects, and from industry. We will also draw on the wealth of expertise in our local communities, particularly in amateur associations and societies, where we already have strong links. 

We will aim to provide opportunities for &amp;quot;hands-on&amp;quot; activities in STFC core subjects through provision of equipment and materials to support the classroom presentations. Our participants will learn to describe and understand the nature of astronomical objects visible in the Gillerthwaite dark skies and we will provide familiarity with simple equipment used to study and gather data about them. This will include information about techniques of astrophotography at a level sufficient to enable participants to start taking their own images. We will emphasise how this work at an introductory level relates to the cutting-edge science and facilities available at STFC-funded laboratories. In the sustainable energy theme we will aim to foster awareness of the issues involved in implementing strategies in sustainable energy at a micro- (LGFC operates its own micro-hydroelectric scheme) and macro-scale and focus on the opportunities and threats that exist for the UK, and the world, in the transition to a low-carbon economy. We will emphasise how STFC technologies in this field are enabling this transition. 

LGFC has an integrated approach to public engagement with the natural sciences. In addition to core themes of astronomy and sustainable energy the Centre will also offer workshops and public access events in planetary geoscience and geology. We intend also to develop a theme in ecology and biology reflecting our Ennerdale location at the focus of the Forestry Commission Wild Ennerdale wild land restoration project (www.wildennerdale.co.uk). While we do not seek support for these initiatives here, they are mentioned to show the potential for future cross-research council, multi-disiplinary funding applications in response to calls for greater integration and outreach activity by individual research councils and RCUK.

The mission of the LGFC (www.lgfc.org.uk) is to inform and enthuse young people about natural science and conservation in the beautiful setting of Ennerdale in the Lake District National Park. The Centre focuses on bringing an appreciation and understanding of the natural world to young people from urban backgrounds particularly those from cities and large towns of northern England and those from underprivileged backgrounds. The impact on the individual within the target groups is potentially profound. Many of our visitors may never have ventured out of a city before experiencing the wild environment and dark skies of Ennerdale. By introducing young people from such backgrounds to natural science in this environment we can change lives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Marketing of the STFC-LGFC Education Hub

The workshops and activities of the Education Hub are targeted at children of school ages from 9-17, parents and the general public together with youth groups from city areas. We will seek to market our offering of innovative and inspiring workshops, and hands-on experimental and observing sessions in natural science to this diverse group using:

1) The STEM-schools network; initially STEM Cumbria Ltd (Tony Gill) and MerseySTEM (Michelle Dow) (Merseyside, North Cheshire and Warrington); 
2) The Youth Project network in Cumbria and Merseyside building on existing links with the Walton Youth Project and the South Workington Youth Project;
3) Dedicated pages on the LGFC and STFC websites explaining the aims of the Education Hub;
4) Our contacts with journalists in the local (West Cumbria) press: The Whitehaven News and The Cumberland News and the local press in our target cities of northern England; Radio Cumbria.
5) Popular science publications and websites of national organisations: The Astronomical Society; BBC Star Gazing Live; Sky at Night magazine; Astronomy Now magazine;
6) The Lake District National Park website and publications where we already place advertising in connection with our Dark Sky Discovery Site activities.
7) BBC 1 &amp;quot;Countryfile&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Secret Britain&amp;quot; programmes - The Wild Ennerdale Project has already featured twice on &amp;quot;Countryfile&amp;quot;;
8) The Ennerdale Centre - a lottery-funded development of a community centre at Ennerdale Bridge, our nearest village - will be a focus for dissemination of information about the Hub and how to become a volunteer. More information about the Ennerdale Centre can be found at ennerdalecentre@btinternet.com. 

We will also search out non-STEM schools in our target geographic areas and seek to engage science teachers in these schools in our activities. 

Teaching and instruction material prepared for our interactive workshops and observing sessions will be made available as a resource to our visiting groups through our website, and publicly through the STEM e_library. 

The medium-term objective of this marketing activity is to build up a local and national awareness of our activities and a client base such that after the completion of this project (in 2018) LGFC will be in a position to offer 4-6 Educational Hub activity residential weekends each year on a sustainable basis. 

Dissemination of outcomes, resources and ideas 

We will vigorously pursue a programme of communicating the activities and successes of the STFC-LGFC Education Hub to scientists, educators, communicators, and 'Public Engagement' people using:
1) The LGFC membership and their networks;
2) Our network of STEM and non-STEM schools and Youth Project Groups;
3) STFC and LGFC websites and LGFC Facebook account;
4) The PSCI-Conm Digest - an email list containing opportunities and information for public engagement people nation-wide. containing opportunities and information for public engagement people nation-wide.
5) Our contacts with Dark Skies Discovery Sites in northern England and southern Scotland: North Pennine Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty; The Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park; Kielder Water and Forest Park/Kielder Observatory;
6) Our contacts with the Lake District National Park;
7) The Forestry Commission, particularly the management of the Wild Ennerdale project;
8) Our network of contacts in local astronomical societies in the north of England;
9) The media: local and national press; Radio Cumbria; BBC 1 programmes &amp;quot;Countryfile and &amp;quot;Secret Britain&amp;quot;.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dark Sky Discovery site open-to-the-public event 9/01/2016 and 10/01/2016 at Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre (LGFC)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>136D31CF-AF8E-4A80-B02E-E6876C97059F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dark Sky Discovery open-to-the-public events have been held at LGFC since the centre was designated as a Dark Sky Discovery Site (Milky Way class) in 2010.

Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre Association
Education Hub Volunteers' Day
19th September 2015
Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre is a Dark Sky Discovery Site and is also host to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Education Hub in northern England. Our aim is to introduce young people and families to the excitement of discovering more about natural sciences and the environment at our field centre in Ennerdale. Each year we organise two or three events open to the general public and a number of weekend events for schools and youth groups where the focus is on astronomy, sustainable energy and geology. To take full advantage of our location at the heart of the Wild Ennerdale project, we are planning to broaden our activities to include environmental sciences, archaeology and local history and we are looking for new volunteers to help us run our events. Our annual volunteer day is for existing LGFCA member-volunteers and members of the association who are thinking about becoming a volunteer. It is also an opportunity for people in the local (Ennerdale) community to find out about our work and, if they wish, to become a volunteer themselves. If you think you may be interested in volunteering, please come and visit us on our volunteer day on 19th September 2015. Our website is at: http://www.lgfc.org.uk/
Provisional programme

The reason given was that a change of leadership of the Pupil Referral Unit lead to a redesign of parental permission paperwork which then had to be completed by parents for the second time at short notice. Unsurprisingly, the parents involved did not respond in time to the new request and the event was cancelled. The was sad but typical for these children as it seemed they were caught between hard pressed teachers doing their best in an underfunded and under-loved sector of education and school politics. Working with PRU unit children was also extremely controversial for the LGFCA. Although fully in line with the mission of the Association the chairman and some trustees did not support this initiative.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>586bc5b287a871.77123140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dark Sky Discovery site open-to-the-public event 06/02/2016 at Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre (LGFC)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0E5AE84-89E5-49D6-9F13-9FA79A96743C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event programme was as follows:
