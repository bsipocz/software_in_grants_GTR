This framework will enable the Lab to evaluate and analyse the impact its design approach has on developing and implementing policy. It will be underpinned by a thorough review of existing literature to ground the Lab's evaluation in established research findings and methods.

The Policy Lab was set up in April 2014 by the Cabinet Office, part of the UK Civil Service. It aims to experiment with bringing design approaches to policy-making in central government by undertaking projects with government departments funding the lab. Led by experienced designer Dr Andrea Siodmok, this is a one-year pilot project that will design services around people's experiences, using data analytics and new digital tools based on policy goals. The Policy Lab replicates similar activities elsewhere notably in Denmark, which set up a cross-ministerial innovation unit MindLab a decade ago, as well as Nesta's Public Innovation Lab and The Australian Centre for Social Innovation. 

Most of the existing literature on these initiatives currently belong in reports, conferences, and blog posts; there is comparatively little academic writing about using design approaches in policy making in central government. This project will combine the existing literature on design in policy with related academic research in design studies, participatory design, policy and management research to provide a thorough review of this emerging field.

Informed by this review, the Fellow will work with the Policy Lab and its stakeholders (including government departments) to co-design, iterate and implement a framework to evaluate the success of the Policy Lab's pilot year. The framework will look at how using research methods in the development and implementation of policy makes for better, more relevant, more smoothly implemented policy. 

A public blog will be set up on mappingsocialdesign.org to inform audience for relevant stakeholders towards the end of the project to reflect on its findings. Finally, a report aimed at practitioners and managers in policy contexts will be published about the framework and its implications for bringing design approaches into policy-making and delivery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will lead to academic and societal impact in the short, medium and long term. Four main beneficiary groups will benefit from this research.

1. The primary users and beneficiaries are in the Policy Lab itself, the Open Policy Making team, the wider Cabinet Office. By co-developing an evaluation framework for the Policy Lab, and helping the Policy Lab team adapt and develop its indicators of success, the project will, in the short term, increase the effectiveness of public services, support increased creativity in devising policy in UK central government, and improve the effectiveness of collaboration between the Cabinet Office and government departments. 

2. A secondary set of users and beneficiaries are staff in the 17 government departments directly or indirectly involved in supporting the Lab and learning from its activities including the evaluation framework that is the focus of the fellowship. Activities include joint participation in Policy Lab workshops and opportunities to co-design the Policy Lab evaluation framework. Impacts in the medium to long term will be increased effectiveness of public services, increased creativity in devising policy in UK central government, and improved effectiveness in the collaboration between the Cabinet Office and government departments. 

3. A wider group of users and beneficiaries in the UK and internationally are those within other central and local government, including other policy labs, and public sector orientated service design initiatives in the UK and internationally such as The Policy Lab, MindLab, and TACSI. Other users include intermediaries such as Nesta, think tanks such as New Economics Foundation. Impacts in the long term include increased effectiveness of public services, and increased creativity when developing public services. Activities include co-hosting or participating in a workshop at the end of the fellowship.

4. A fourth group of users and beneficiaries are designers and managers working in organisations that work with policy-makers and commissioners of public services, including commercial firms such as Capita and Microsoft, design firms such as Futuregov, and NGOs, social enterprises and charities. Impacts in the longer term include increasing the effectiveness of public services, and increased creativity in working with commissioners of public services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>63242</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Opportunities for policy engagement - Arts and Humanities early career researchers</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F02F5A96-3125-4798-BEA8-EC74554733C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a talk about Open Policy Making to a group of early career researchers in the arts and humanities in a programme organised by the Institute for Government.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e017facac012.17276802</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Open Policy Making blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>14B8593E-4B79-42E0-AF98-46209AD4E3C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I wrote 4 blog posts during my research fellowship on the Cabinet Office Open Policy blog about Policy Lab's activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e015dd522ff5.76241068</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://openpolicy.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/23/panel-discussion-should-policymakers-be-policy-designers-2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SPRU 50th anniversary conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2AD8235F-967C-4575-990D-F081171F8D7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I took part in a panel discussion about the emergence of 'policy labs' inside government entities, which was an event at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) 50th anniversary conference at Sussex University, which attracted both practitioners and academics including people from government and funders.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d30647f6d6.05794446</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public event - Cabinet Office - Ethnography in Policy Making</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>34CB8E5C-94CE-4599-BB83-F0707516ACB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>80 people attended a two hour event during which three speakers (and one chair) shared perspectives on the use of ethnographic research in government policy making.

The main outputs were: a research blog; events held at the Cabinet Office; contributions to the Cabinet Office Open Policy Making blog; and a written report. Since there is a lively community of practice exploring what design brings to government innovation active in social media (in particular twitter and blogs), being an active participant in these discussions was another route to impact. 

Of these channels and outputs, my report about Policy Lab was a key output. It was published in October 2015 and shared online as a PDF via my research blog which (by 13 March 2017) had 5656 views and 3612 visitors. Of the 750 printed copies, more than half were distributed in the UK civil service. Other copies were sent to the EU Policy Lab development team, distributed to EU policy officials interested in design attending an event, as well as civil servants and social innovators working on policy issues and academics in the US, Canada, UAE, France, Israel and Australia. 

At the time of writing I have only anecdotal evidence of how it is influencing civil servants' thinking on what design brings to policy innovation. The policy innovation framework developed in the report resulting from the fellowship has shaped how Policy Lab conceives of its own impact and role and some civil servants are using it to inform the narrative about their activities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FBE6A38F-5CF0-4A54-A89D-A4CE991ADC8C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7ee377a8e5.08732822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This fellowship resulted in my being embedded three days a week for a year in Policy Lab, a small team in the Cabinet Office working with government departments, citizens, experts and specialist design consultancies. I joined about halfway through their first year and was involved actively in helping them design, deliver and make sense of workshops and longer projects that brought new approaches to the work of policy officials. The research involved collaborative discovery about what design approaches could bring to policy making, as the team explored bringing into being new kinds of policy making expertise. 

The findings make sense of what the Policy Lab team were doing and their outcomes in the context of central government policy making practice. I combined literatures from design, organisation studies and science and technology studies to summarise their approach and support their ongoing evaluation. 

In addition to sharing the findings summarised below, I developed with policy officials a visual evaluation framework informed by organisation studies literature to help make sense of where Policy Lab (and design expertise) can contribute to organisational exploration and to the delivery of policy. 

The main findings were: 

(1) Policy Lab uses an approach and expertise based in design to help the policy community explore and develop new capabilities in generating and interpreting early-stage insights, engaging with delivery partners, specialists and stakeholders, and closing the delivery gap between policy intent and outcomes. 

(2) As well as practically servicing teams on live policy issues, Policy Lab works with departments to develop new hybrid ways of working and to challenge existing ways of doing things in the ongoing mediation between politics, evidence and delivery.

(3) Policy Lab's projects engage a range of people in collective exploration of a policy issue, through which problems and solutions co-evolve in iterative learning cycles. 

(4) This approach helps discover and build confidence in plausible insights and concepts that can then further developed and exploited by more conventional means leading to improved delivery and more likely impact. 

(5) Insights and concepts generated through this approach reorder what matters, by bringing into view the complexity and lived experiences of people affected by or involved in a policy problem, rather than starting with the existing system. 

(6) The approach enables people inside and outside of government to collaborate effectively by enabling more equal participation, generating a shared language and approach and acknowledging difference constructively.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings provide a way to make sense of design in the context of policy making that goes beyond accounts of design activities/methods/outputs. 

With ongoing interest in design thinking in business, social innovation and local government, these findings demonstrate what outcomes design approaches can achieve in complex organisations through practically supporting the exploration of opportunities, rather than the current focus on exploiting opportunities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>63E4395E-5C60-4E42-9888-5709FE6C7BE1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7b7b9925c8.82865813</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://researchingdesignforpolicy.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Open Policy Toolkit published on gov.uk website</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A598394-7CE6-406F-A59D-B0856849E3B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd85562e27e7.91122754</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-policy-making-toolkit</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Arts and humanities into Policy: Policy maker- researcher speed dating event</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>11812F47-F8DA-4391-B7E6-81C7C2B74C74</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd850ca48a14.30179444</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://openpolicy.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/01/notes-from-a-policy-speed-dating-event/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Short course for Civil Service Learning - Design Thinking for Policy Makers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>464E0DFE-397E-4D98-973A-825FE724C899</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd84932ef2f5.50706264</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Cabinet Office letter recommending future investment in design research in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B02FF23B-6B56-469A-B77C-46E820F6E7BC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd859111a3d2.03921102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>156C9543-B667-47DD-9332-D8AA77B274D0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Design in the Time of Policy Problems</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aeb803b7f4113856b40c29a12fc8afc2"><gtr:id>aeb803b7f4113856b40c29a12fc8afc2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kimbell, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>23983132</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d0e01f29f5.29709185</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DA1CFD3D-5320-427A-B1C7-3FB44FCC2212</gtr:id><gtr:title>Applying Design Approaches to Policy Making: Discovering Policy Lab</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f9765f8a48081ce6c14e243c89848ca7"><gtr:id>f9765f8a48081ce6c14e243c89848ca7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kimbell Lucy</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781910172063</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd83fcb8daf0.96317544</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D8B8CA53-9D3B-4B12-982C-B2D4AC9F3EC9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prototyping and the new spirit of policy-making</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>CoDesign</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/61f874b406ba887bb04a80ad0e03d7b2"><gtr:id>61f874b406ba887bb04a80ad0e03d7b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kimbell L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc4814ec1d2.48178798</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M005445/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
