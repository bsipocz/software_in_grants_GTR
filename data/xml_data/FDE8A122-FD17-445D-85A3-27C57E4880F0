This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The rapid growth of AD at ~35% pa since 2012, from 78 to 145 plants in 2014, with 342 in development is due to: (i) Agriculture, food processing and waste management who face increasing costs for energy and waste disposal at &amp;pound;80/te to landfill as well as increasing landfill restrictions in food and biowaste disposal; (ii) Feed in Tariffs (FIT) and Renewable Heat Incentives (RHI) which apply to AD CHP plants of &amp;lt;5MWe. At 20%pa, by 2020 the UK could have &amp;gt;500 AD plants and by 2025 &amp;gt;1000 AD plants. AD currently uses land biomass such as cereals, grass silages or food crops to supplement varying levels of waste streams causing a negative impact on land for food vs fuel and concerns over GHG emissions. While AD has the potential to meet 10% of UK energy demand by 2020 (ADBA 2014), alternative sustainable feedstocks are essential. Seaweed does not compete with food for land or require fresh water. It is fast growing, captures CO2 more efficiently than land plants and is a bio-remediator. It has carbohydrate (CHO) /gross calorific value (GCV) 11-15MJ/kg comparable with cereals (13-19/MJ/kg). Seaweed can replace grass silage in AD combined with food waste to produce the same gas yield 10.4m3 CH4/t. 

Utilising all waste streams, the UK AD industry could generate 40.4TWh of biogas, or &amp;gt;10% of demand and be worth &amp;pound;2-3Bn by 2020. AD process knowledge and economics will inform plant design to maximise returns from FIT and RHI. TCE and the steering panel will identify early adopters by M18, in East Anglia and Scotland to build pilot AD plants in the 20ml coastal strip, near waste streams, within 6M of project completion. This will minimise transport costs and GHG emissions and benefit from closed loop energy integration. AD plants can be funded by loans from eg Green Investment Bank, (~&amp;pound;3Bn), Enterprise Finance Scheme(~&amp;pound;2Bn). Small AD plants generating &amp;lt;500kWe, with seaweed at &amp;pound;300/t dwt can return &amp;pound;700k-&amp;pound;1Mpa with build costs of &amp;pound;2M-&amp;pound;3M and ROI &amp;lt;4 yrs, including &amp;pound;5/ttate as fertiliser but excluding savings in waste disposal. Larger AD plants generating 2MWe, with seaweed at &amp;pound;150/tdwt can return &amp;pound;2Mpa with build costs of &amp;pound;3M to provide ROI in &amp;lt; 2yrs. Operation of 50 such plants using 2.5Mt seaweed by 2025, with growth of 20% pa to 2030 is feasible. This will require a multi-harvest, high yield, (200t/ha) seaweed farming system (Benchmark Holdings). TCE manage min ~6.6Mha coastal seabed, equivalent to the UK area of arable land, and will licence this to generate Treasury revenue, promote economic growth, job creation and further exploitation of seaweed based on the supply chain economics and the storage system. 2% (132,000ha, 1,320km2) of the coastal seabed producing 200t/ha seaweed would supply up to 26Mt seaweed value ~&amp;pound;390M for AD. To generate the same energy in AD with maize, instead of seaweed (at 22m3 CH4/t), would use 12% UK arable land. TCE will support supply chain development by leasing land for storage, NSMC and Norfolk Council will promote seaweed for biofuel production, CEFAS will lead on marine management. Further exploitation of seaweed in fermentation and energy generation by gasification will be economically enabled and the partners will apply the expertise and knowledge in other IB processes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>534373</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>SeaGas project meetings</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F5C543F-0624-464E-8F39-9094C3C2C8F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multidisciplinary collaboration that brings together scientists, social scientists, policy makers, industry partners to study the opportunity of using kelp for anaerobic digestion and energy generation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e01801c40740.45466215-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The project was presented and each partner agreed the the next steps in the research and collaboration activities</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The SeaGas Project was launched with a kick-off meeting at CPI, Wilton Centre, Wilton, Redcar.

This visit to the Marine Station allowed the SeaGas team an opportunity to introduce the families concerned to the work we do. The opportunity was taken to take the families through the entire process required to grow kelp at the lab until the point of deployment. By seeing the entire process and not just the buoys out at sea the families came to understand the amount of work involved and the pride that we take in what we do. Subsequently we have come to an arrangement on the buoys at sea, altered the colour, and now we have a good working relationship.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6d789af0024.74816365</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visit (St. Josephs)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0F4F5A7-40C9-4DE5-94B5-37310CA27167</gtr:id><gtr:impact>School talk as part of a STEM initiative.

The representatives from DAERA went to the SeaGas site with members of the SeaGas team to see the long lines with well established kelp and also those that grew poorly due to delayed deployment as a consequence of bureaucracy and legitimate concerns of local land owners. Subsequently agreement was reached between DAERA and the Goods that it would be best if they could deal directly with the SeaGas team at QML to resolve any concerns.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6de9ec79b34.77962477</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with Radio 4 Farming Today 12 Sep 16</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8FF71617-DEB8-4361-83FC-D476035F0B15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Emma Gorman interviewed on Radio 4 Farming today about seaweed farming broadcast 12 September 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6db78a1cae6.69800116</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07rkjfy</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Student site visit, Portaferry, December 13th, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DBA4C4E7-37A3-491B-8DA1-BA351148CAC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Students from the Undergraduate course BSc Land Use and Environmental Management visited the facilities in Portaferry, by Strangford Lough, to appreciate the biology of growing kelp for anaerobic digestion.

In the first year we harvested about 10 tons of kelp in Strangford Lough. We then posted the kelp to CPI in England. 
We also started the environmental assessment of growing seaweed in Strangford Lough. The initial data we have collected so far show that the activity of growing seaweed does not causes significant environmental damage. The monitoring is continuing in this second year. We are also evaluating the economic and social impacts of the activity. this monitoring will continue during year 2 and 3 of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>927FC752-3FB4-45CF-B142-D8838929426C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56debaaf396c77.46701855</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Currently agriculture, the food and drinks industry and waste treatment firms employ anaerobic digestion (AD) to treat their wastes and generate energy, thus creating a revenue stream whilst making process savings. A combination of wastes and energy crops are generally used as feeds for AD. However, supply of sufficient waste materials and land-based crops can be variable for a number of reasons. 
Seaweed potentially offers another energy crop option for coastal/island communities, without the contentious issue associated with land-take which could be used for agriculture.
There has been a good deal of academic study into the potential for seaweeds of different varieties to deliver high value chemicals, food additives/supplements, chemical or bioenergy. Almost all of the literature regarding the exploitation of seaweeds suggests that seaweeds have a suite of chemical and biological properties which make them suitable for wider use. However, in reality, apart from very large seaweed farms off the coastlines of East Asia, large scale commercial farming and utilisation is almost non-existent elsewhere on the globe.
In European waters, only naturally growing seaweeds are used commercially on a fairly small scale. Part of the problem lies in the actual farming and harvesting methodologies, which need a step-change in technology for viable, large-scale application. The other missing link is the supply chain, creating market 'pull' for seaweed farming at large scale. Potential developers and end users do not yet have the evidence they need to invest in large scale commercial seaweed farming and bioenergy production. The aim of the SeaGas project is to provide more confidence to a nascent market, and to highlight any adverse issues which would affect viability.
During the first year of the project, we have increased the production of kelp, a particular type of seaweed, in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland. The aim is to continue to increase the production of kelp at a commercial scale to explore the costs and benefits of using kelp for anaerobic digestion. We are also monitoring the environmental effects of growing kelp in Strangford Lough.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It's still too early to say, as we are at the beginning of the project.
However, we can expect that the results of this project might be used by the fishing and fishfarming industry. 
Our findings will provide benefits to the government to support the government's targets in terms of renewable energy production, energy security, and greenhouse gas emissions abatement.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BCBEEB52-2683-4370-8E3B-8E4AF5F13FC4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deb4bf89c877.36916500</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://seagas.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M028690/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A5240626-9660-4BCA-A8F1-528736D7026E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
