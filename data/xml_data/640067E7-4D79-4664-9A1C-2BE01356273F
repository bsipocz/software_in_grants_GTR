The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be faster and plants would grow faster. This speeding-up of photosynthesis will happen naturally over the next fifty years or so as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise due to human activities. However, there is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in tiny green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. We have recently discovered important new information about this mechanism, and we have invented new and rapid methods to discover algal genes that contribute to it. We have two complementary and parallel aims. First, we will apply our new methods to identify all of the genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and we will discover exactly how these genes work. Second, we will transfer the most important genes into a plant, and study whether the same CCM can be recreated inside a leaf. If it can, we expect that our experimental plant will have higher rates of photosynthesis and hence a higher rate of growth than normal plants. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to use the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) from green algae to enhance CO2 concentration in C3 chloroplasts, suppressing photorespiration and increasing productivity. The CAPP programme will discover and characterise components of the Chlamydomonas CCM, in addition to known bicarbonate pump(s) and carbonic anhydrases, identify pyrenoid components, supramolecular complexes and their chaperones, and progressively incorporate key components into Arabidopsis. Our approach includes: 1) Addition of a bicarbonate pump to the chloroplast envelope inner membrane (and removal of any CO2-channelling aquaporins: PIP1 sub-family) to maximize bicarbonate accumulation in the chloroplast. 2) Formation of ordered clusters of modified Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase in the chloroplast to benefit from local CO2 concentration at the active sites, and to distance the Rubisco from the site of O2 generation at PSII. 3) Discovery of genes required for the CCM in Chlamydomonas through a novel, high throughput insertional mutant screen and parallel, hypothesis-driven RNAi approaches 3) Progressive addition of newly-discovered CCM components into an Arabidopsis plant incorporating the above novel features, followed by characterisation of the metabolism and physiology of the lines thus generated 4) Mathematical modelling methods to identify constraints to carbon uptake and exchange in Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis, and to evaluate the improvement in carbon supply likely to arise as CCM components are added to Arabidopsis. The goal is to create an Arabidopsis 'Advanced Plant', with significantly improved rates of CO2 assimilation. This is a first step towards producing a crop plant with a 'biophysical' CCM that significantly improves productivity and yield.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 1.
