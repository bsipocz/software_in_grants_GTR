Environments</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K005693/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This fellowship will be used to assemble a new UK team of physical and life scientists with the aim of turning natural processes into engineering applications. Our goal is to discover new ways of sustainably processing naturally sourced materials which will in turn reduce the environmental footprint of oil-based polymers.

The majority of natural materials are grown. Silks, by definition, are spun. My own work has shown that in many ways silk spinning has more in common with industrial polymer extrusion; however there is one key difference, environmental impact. Silk is a high performance, biodegradable biopolymer spun at room temperature, with the only waste product being water. We have also recently demonstrated this process occurs at an energy cost around a thousand times less than a typical polymer. Such a unique source of inspiration is now more valuable than ever, as global industry faces increasing pressure from consumers and governments to find new ways of producing high quality yet fully sustainable materials. 

The overall objective of this proposal is to develop the means to control the processing of biopolymers into structures with predictable properties. To achieve this, my team and I will use the state-of-the-art characterisation lab I have already assembled. This permits us to study our test materials before, during and after processing. First we will design a series of biomimetic spinning devices based on the shape and processing conditions of a natural silk gland. This device will be validated by spinning small amounts of native silk feedstocks with the aim of producing fibres indistinguishable from those spun naturally. Secondly we will use artificially produced silk feedstocks, which can be obtained in large quantities, to spin fibres with predictable properties and in amounts suitable for investigating new industrial applications. Thirdly using our knowledge of how best to process a silk feedstock, we will then investigate non-fibre based processing of these materials, namely blade coating to make films and 3D printing to make complex structures. Finally the team will subject a range of artificial biopolymer feedstocks to our processing techniques and assess their potential in terms of sustainability and performance. 

The outputs from this project will encompass technological achievements and scientific insights. Technologically, the development of a biomimetic spinning rig will be the first of its kind and should be valuable as well as high profile. We will discover if an artificial feedstock can be processed into a material with properties equal to, if not better than, its natural progenitor. Extension of our spinning platform into other processing technologies will answer a highly controversial question &amp;quot;is silk a good material, or just a good fibre?&amp;quot; Investigating other biological materials, which have uses from food to healthcare, will reveal if it is possible to spin a biopolymer optimised for growth. Industry will be engaged throughout the project to identify we can learn from a system with 400 million years of research and development. Together, my team and I will provide an unprecedented understanding of how to sustainably process naturally sourced materials and the tools to drive this science into the 21st century.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Fellowship will support an emerging area of UK research and develop new ways to engage with industry and take science from the bench-top to the factory floor. Discovering new ways to process biologically sourced materials in a sustainable manner will have a broad scientific, technological and potentially environmental impact, affecting industries that depend on biopolymers, the researchers employed on the grant and several academic communities (see Academic Beneficiaries) and the general public. 

Impact on the Economy
Development of novel technologies for the controlled extrusion of biopolymers will have several impacts in industry. From the generation of patents to products and the potential formation of spin-out companies the initial outputs will be manifest in the high tech silk industry. This is a market predicted to be worth billions and has several UK companies invested in this area (e.g. www.xiros.eu.com, www.oxfordbiomaterials.com), primarily in healthcare sectors. If it is possible to control the processing of a range of biopolymers the impact will extend to other industries, for example medical (collagens), food (soy) and materials (cellulose). The knowledge generated from this project will also potentially improve techniques surrounding the design and wet-processing of novel synthetic polymers enabling access to new low energy, sustainable routes to fabrication. Additionally the tools developed to analyse these materials during processing has already generated interest from UK instrument manufacturers wishing to move into this area. 

Impact on society
Spiders and silk is a topic continually surrounded by public interest. I am passionate about using my research insights to inspire young audiences to undertake a career in STEM subject areas and I will foster the same enthusiasm in my team. I have always found that the general public is interested in high-quality research at the interface of the physical and life sciences. This inherent public interest will be focussed by school visits, general exhibitions, media interactions through television, radio and press and a website dedicated to promoting this exciting research. 

The international collaborations supported through this proposal will actively raise the global profile of UK as well as providing the researchers involved with valuable collaborative experience and knowledge transfer between well-regarded academic institutions. 

Impact on People
Specific beneficiaries include myself, who will establish a new research group, and the 3 PDRAs and technician who will gain employment and further their careers through EPSRC funding. All researchers will benefit from working at a world leading research institution and learning skills that cross the boundaries of engineering and the physical and life sciences. The research will also impact the training of undergraduate students through exposure to lectures, classes, tutorials and research projects carried out within the lab. It will also engage graduate students through masters and doctoral training centre project supervision.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>997052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Biomedical Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration: H2020 FLIPT Consortia</gtr:description><gtr:id>004A3D4A-12CB-4032-A124-C47EDC381F29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 713475</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c82bceb39d09.20149813-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The consortium is composed of a diverse set of organisations linked through the common theme of polymers, their processing and a global vision to improve both in order to meet future challenges of polymer security, energy availability and environmental impact.

To pay tribute to and celebrate the life of Dr Tim Richardson, Inspiration for Life, the charity he set up when diagnosed with terminal cancer in June 2012, presented 24 hours of lectures and music, starting at 5.00 pm on 28 February, and going through to 5.00 pm on 1 March, all taking place in the Hicks Building.

The lectures were on a wide range of subjects - you'll hear from astrophysicists, historians, lawyers, chemists, engineers and more, talking about music, magic, extraterrestrial lifeforms, philosophy, human rights, infinity, and beyond...

Inspiration for Life aims to promote lifelong learning and the public understanding of science, and raises funds for cancer charities. Proceeds from this event will go to Rotherham Hospice and Weston Park Hospital Cancer Charity. Details of the programme can be found on the charity's website, www.inspirationforlife.co.uk.

The event lasted over 1 week and was attended by over 10,000 members of the public with a wide demographic but mainly children and families. We received excellent feedback from all, the audience enjoyed what admittedly was not the most slick or professional stand there, but it was the engagement with the active researchers who were passionate about their work which really captured the general publics attention. The contributors really enjoyed this week, which was hard work, but all found it most enjoyable and the earlier career members of the team expressed increased enthusiasm for STEM subjects and changed their opinions about their future directions, including one that decided they wanted to do a PhD by the end of it.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8f50072cbb4.80884770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/summer-science-exhibition/exhibits/spider-webs-silks/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media: Feature in EPSRC Pioneer Magasine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7F583B0-49EB-4B2B-9CE7-A2727E15CDD6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Chris Holland was featured in Issue 11 (p44-46) of the EPRSC Pioneer Magasine Winter 2013 11, which is distributed to all college members and HEI.
