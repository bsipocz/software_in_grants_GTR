Evidence suggests that schemes involving Community Health Worker (CHWs) can be effective in improving the health of mothers and children. Although such schemes are implemented in some developing countries such as Bangladesh, to guide further developments, much better understanding is needed on what makes CHW programmes successful and under what circumstances. 

In Nigeria, despite significant improvements, mother and child health remains an issue of concern, particularly in rural areas where most vulnerable groups live. In 2012, the Federal Government of Nigeria established the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme (SURE-P) to invest the revenue from fuel subsidy reduction into a social security programme to improve lives of most vulnerable populations. 

One SURE-P component, implemented in selected facilities in each State, focuses on maternal and child health (SURE-P/MCH). The idea is that recruitment of CHWs, combined with infrastructure development, and improved availability of supplies and medicines, will improve access to quality health services, and ultimately, improve mother and child health. Since December 2012, Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) have also been added at selected sites ('SURE-P/MCH+CCT'). These incentive payments to pregnant mothers are linked to use of health services at different stages: e.g. for antenatal care visits and facility deliveries. 

The AIM of this project is to inform strengthening and scaling up of community health worker (CHW) programmes. This will be achieved by investigating two implementations (i.e. with and without conditional cash transfers) of a Nigerian CHW programme, to understand what factors, under what conditions, promote equitable access to quality services, and improve maternal and child health outcomes. We will do so by:
1.Developing an in-depth understanding of the context and the process of implementation of the interventions, including relations between health workforce and infrastructure and supplies;
2.Identifying, assessing and comparing the intervention outputs (e.g. skills and practices of CHWs and efficiency of primary health care facilities) and outcomes (e.g. equitable access to quality MCH services and attainment of MCH outcome targets);
3.Developing an empirically-based and theoretically-grounded model of complex relations between the people involved, context, implementation process, outputs and outcomes of the interventions;
4.Developing transferable best practices for scalability (expansion within a broadly similar context) and generalizability (expansion to different contexts) of the interventions.

This five-year research and development project will be implemented in two States in Nigeria - Niger State in the North and Anambra State in the South, which were selected in consultation with the Federal MOH and SURE-P national programme officer. Selecting two states from different parts of the country will provide an opportunity for different contextual factors that affect the implementation and outcome from the programme to be better elucidated and ensure that the findings are generalisable to the entire country. Within each State we will select three Local Government Areas (LGAs) clusters: one with SURE-P/MCH, one with SURE-P/MCH+CCT and one with no intervention. In each State the two interventions will be assessed against each other and against the comparison (i.e. no implementation) site. 

We will work closely with local, State and Federal policymakers and practitioners, to generate answers that can be used to inform their policy decisions. We expect that better understanding of performance of the CHW programme in Nigeria will inform further strengthening of the existing programme, its replication within Nigeria, and other similar countries considering the implementation of CHW initiatives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The AIM of this project is to inform strengthening and scaling up of community health worker (CHW) programmes.

This five-year study will be implemented in two States in Nigeria - Niger State in the North and Anambra State in the South, identified in consultation with the Federal MOH and SUREP national programme officer. The project is designed as a multi-disciplinary and mixed methods study, using qualitative and quantitative methods. Realist evaluation will be an overall platform for the study, which will use economic evaluation, social sciences and statistical analysis. 

Qualitative data will be collected using in-depth interviews with facility managers, community health workers, PHC staff; facility exit interviews and focus group discussions with service users and their families. Quantitative data will include existing data from HMIS and SURE-P programme and structured facility exit survey with pregnant women. Analysis of quantitative and qualitative datasets will be integrated, to allow in-depth exploration of emerging issues and continuous triangulation of findings.

Project results will be disseminated widely through development of policy briefs, presentations at management meetings, newsletters and press-releases, to ensure their uptake in policy and practice in Nigeria and wider.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect our research to have a positive impact on Nigeria and internationally, due to: 
a. development of expertise in how to advise policy-makers on the development and implementation of context-specific health and social policies
b. utilisation of an innovative cross-disciplinary approach to assess the effectiveness of a complex intervention 
c. capacity strengthening and use of an innovative research approach in a highly influential African country 
d. scientific advancement of theories on how to strengthen health systems and improve maternal and child services and health outcomes within the context of developing countries with relatively high and inequitable mortality and morbidity

The main beneficiaries are: 
a. Policy-makers and implementers at the local, State, Federal, African and global levels responsible for the development and implementation of maternal and child health (MCH) and Community Health Worker (CHW) policies and Conditional Cash Transfer programmes
b. Nigerian public and private MCH service providers and practitioners
c. Local, national and international civil society organisations and user associations with interest in advocacy and provision of MCH services and beyond
d. National and international academia interested in MCH, health systems and policy research
e. Local, national and international media with a focus on health and social issues. 

The economic and societal impact will be generated through the following benefits:
1) Improved policymaking: 
Nigerian national and state policymakers will be provided with clear evidence of effectiveness of the two SURE-P components within two States, which will enable them to make informed decisions about the future implementation of these two programme components.

The comparative analysis will equip Nigerian State and Federal policy-makers with understanding of what works for whom and under what circumstances, to allow strengthening the SURE-P and developing accompanying legislation at different levels.

2) Improved policy implementation and service delivery:
Nigerian policy-implementers and practitioners at different levels will improve their understanding of how to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and performance of MCH services and practices, improve the use of community health workers (CHWs) and adapt the implementation of the conditional cash transfer scheme. 

The research will inform the need, and possible paths, for a change in culture and practices within health facilities to improve the quality of MCH services and changes in community practices related to MCH.

The research results will increase public awareness in Nigeria, and other similar countries, on how to strengthen the provision of MCH services and improve maternal and child health status. This information is likely to be taken up by local, national and international civil society organisations, user associations and media groups. 

The results will inform social and private service providers in Nigeria on how to contribute effectively and efficiently to the provision of MCH services.

3) Improved health systems:
The research will inform the implementation for CHWs in Nigeria and other low and middle income countries (e.g. enhancement of the training curriculum and supervision and support required to CHWs).

International and national policymakers will be able to use the evidence for health systems strengthening through evidence-informed policies on MCH and an improved understanding of the context-dependency of health and social policymaking and implementation.

4) Improved health outcomes:
Nigerian women and children in general and specifically groups with compounded effects of vulnerability (such as poverty, education, region, religion and ethnicity) will benefit due to improved awareness and participation in the research and findings how to improve their health and well-being considering their specific circumstances.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>794948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We developed and implemented two 90-minute webinars introducing health systems researchers to the concept of Realist Evaluation and the application of Realist Methodology for evaluating health systems interventions in low and middle income countries.

During the meeting, we also handed out the project awareness leaflet to these key stakeholders who agreed to further distribute the leaflet within their organisations and networks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e02a23a576f9.46986996</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation at the 2nd International Conference on Realist Evaluation and Synthesis (London UK).</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67C44037-5C45-4FF5-86C7-6177050A2BDA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In October 2016, a member of the REVAMP project team, Dr. Ana Manzano, gave an oral presentation on &amp;quot;Capacity Building Models in Realist Evaluation&amp;quot;, at the CARES conference in London.

The round-table discussion sparked questions and debate afterwards, and the researchers asked for additional information on using different models of capacity building in low- and middle-income countries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c4150c07ca52.94404567</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.twitter.com/ana__manzano/status/783585940002443264</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Lecture on Using Logic Models in Realist Evaluation (for Postgraduate researchers, University of Leeds, UK)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>133B4245-5132-43B7-AAD9-2752D918141F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In April 2016, a member of the REVAMP project consortium (Dr. Bassey Ebenso) delivered a lecture on using Logic models for evaluating complex healthcare programmes such as mother and child health programmes in Nigeria. As part of the lecture, Bassey: i) Defined logic models (LMs) and their usefulness to programme stakeholders; ii) Described components of LMs and processes involved in creating LMs; iii) Highlighted some of the practicalities of creating LMs and the limitations of LMs; iv) Discussed contextual factors that can influence programme evaluation and they can be addressed (using an example from Nigeria). Twenty (20) postgraduate research students from different countries in the world attended the lecture. The lecture sparked questions and discussions afterwards, and the students asked for clarification on how to use logic models for programme evaluation in their various organisations. The students later used insight and skills from the lecture to develop a logic model as part of the module assignment in Realist Evaluation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c534c7589563.36578474</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/ana__manzano/status/725756387087757312</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We developed a logic model for mother and child health (MCH) care component of the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme in Nigeria. The logic model graphically de-constructed our (i.e. researchers, policy makers and implementers) current understanding of how the programme should work in the context of Nigeria by illustrating complex relations between key actors, context, implementation process, outputs and outcomes of programme interventions. This logic model is used as tool for informing the initial programme theories. The logic model also served as a focal point for discussions and decisions about data collection and analysis by displaying when, where, and how to obtain information most needed to assess the programme and its context.</gtr:description><gtr:id>777CE793-0D32-4583-AFBA-C656C3E38324</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In November 2015, we presented a poster outlining the process of developing the logic model at a State of the Art Realist Methodologies Conference in Leeds (UK), to a group of over 50 realist evaluation researchers from across multiple continents.

Members of the author team also received a number of requests for copies of the poster, illustrating the academic interest in this output.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d46478998c78.20981468</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Pre-implementation logic model of a national programme in Nigeria</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1302.5042</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a methodology handbook outlining the mixed-methods and multi-disciplinary approach that adopted realist evaluation as an overall methodological framework. This handbook is currently guiding investigation of how the deployment of trained community health workers interacts with other health systems interventions (i.e. infrastructure, equipment and supplies) and the wider context to improve access to maternity services and health outcomes in Nigeria. The approach combines: i) sociological analysis of the views of key actors, ii) statistical analysis of quantitative data of utilization of maternal health services; and iii) economic evaluation of benefits and cost of interventions.

This will be responding to the research interests, and demand, from the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria and the Anambra State government (Eastern Nigeria). We anticipate that in the longer-term the handbook will inform designs of similar studies adopting theory-driven evaluation approaches and utilising mixed-methods study designs in evaluating interventions within health systems of low and middle income countries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cdedbcb61ae3.39175293</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Methodology handbook for realist evaluation of community health workers (CHWs) programme in Nigeria</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/info/691/research/1882/revamp</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3E4BE31-3963-4833-A0DE-32C02677BCFA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Study protocol: realist evaluation of effectiveness and sustainability of a community health workers programme in improving maternal and child health in Nigeria.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Implementation science : IS</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1e7c78eadf28ca4eaba020626af711e8"><gtr:id>1e7c78eadf28ca4eaba020626af711e8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mirzoev T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1748-5908</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d73ef29afe9.81530532</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M01472X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>FA7AA693-7EDD-4A7E-8CA3-6B5658FBF717</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive Health and Childbirth</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
