If no specific actions are taken, this will raise the level of electromagnetic (EM) radiation that the general public is exposed to, and increase their concerns about it. The overall objective of this research work is to investigate innovative techniques for reducing the EM exposure from communication systems by turning the increased density of access points, which will be a cornerstone of future networks, into an advantage. Having more access points in the networks give more degrees of freedom to, for example; reduce the transmit power of mobile device (i.e. the main source of exposure) by connecting/transmitting to several receivers simultaneously, or to connect/transmit only to access points that are not in the direction of the user head/body.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project aims at better understanding the relationship between the EM emission radiation that individual users are exposed to and the overall data rate in 5G wireless communication systems, where access point (AP) densification is the cornerstone technology for meeting the future increase in traffic demand. We believe that instead of portraying the densification process as an extra source of EM exposure and, hence, health concerns, it can be turned into an opportunity for modifying the modus operandi of communication equipment and reducing EM radiation towards users. 

In this regard, we believe that our project, on top of its obvious academic contribution, will also have a tangible impact on the operators (through modification of the modus operandi of communication equipment and EM-aware deployment), regulators (by building-in exposure reduction into new standards or regulations) and, last but not least, the general public (through reduced individual EM exposure).

1) Indeed, pre-emptive actions must be taken to improve the level of confidence towards communication systems in the general public and to make them safer to use in the long-run without having to compromise on when and/or where to use them, contrary to the recent guidelines set by the European Environmental Agency. We believe that our project can deliver on this and, hence, ensure the environmental sustainability of wireless communication systems and the continuous growth of their development, which in turn will ensure continuous revenue for operators. 

2) In the case that the latest results on the long-term effect of EM exposure are validated by other studies, this project can have a lasting impact on the health of the general population as well as health system finance by reducing future EM exposure health related issues. We have to bear in mind that it took more than 25 years for the harmfulness of tobacco to be scientifically recognised, and health systems around the world are still coping with the burden. 

3) A better understanding of EM exposure in dense APs deployment will also benefit the network operators when deploying extra APs for 5G systems; they can use this knowledge in conjunction with our novel EM exposure-aware mechanisms to convince regulators that allowing more APs to be deployed will be helpful to reduce EM emission instead of generating more.

4) By combining EM exposure-aware user association and beamforming schemes to take advantage of the densification process, we foresee that the outcome of this research will spur new ideas and further innovation on how to deploy communications in an EM emmision-aware manner and, hence, greatly impact the deployment of future communication systems.

5) Standards bodies and regulators will be informed about our novel exposure mitigation methods and the work can help to build-in exposure reduction into new standards or regulations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100788</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P005853/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
