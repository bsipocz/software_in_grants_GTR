We propose a new examination of JDM starting from the premise that humans are optimal given the constraints imposed on them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We aim to demonstrate that if we take into account the constraints on human cognitive capacity or those imposed by the environment, human JDM is not flawed and is, in fact, optimal given those constraints. We will consider example phenomena, oft-cited as evidence of irrationality and measure both constraints and performance experimentally. We will then compare performance to that of optimal computational models subject to the same constraints. Further, we will show that if we change constraints, humans will adapt and remain optimal, providing a proof of principle of the potential power of this approach to bring about advantageous behavioural change via a principled framework for policy development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Because the current perspective has failed to deliver an account of the causal determinants of behaviour, our proposed theory promises a major shift in social science and behavioural economics research. We aim to displace influential descriptive theories of observed biases with a new framework allowing the development of predictive, falsifiable hypotheses of human JDM.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will develop a causal model of human judgement &amp;amp; decision-making (JDM) that goes beyond describing behaviours to predicting behaviours by understanding why people make decisions, identifying key environmental or human constraints on JDM and evaluating their impact. The project aims to demonstrate that if the constraints imposed by the environment and the limitations of the human cognitive system are taken into account, human judgment and decision making (JDM) are optimal. This is a major shift from the current dominant perspective in Psychology and Behavioural Economics which suggests JDM is irrational, biased or sub-optimal. In doing so the project will replace the descriptive accounts of JDM by developing a novel, causal and predictive framework that facilitates the design and testing of interventions to bring about behavioural change. The model will allow the testing of behavioural change scenarios and prediction of the outcomes. The project also aims to act as a stimulus for novel avenues of investigation across a range of fields in Psychology, Economics and Social Science, with particular emphasis on the constraints impacting on real-life decision making. Practically, it would inform a principled approach to policy change and strategies for behavioural change interventions in a range of contexts, for example to remove the cognitive barriers against sustainable consumption and healthy life styles or to promote better personal finance/financial investment decisions. 

We suggest that previous approaches to induce behaviour change can be less complete than that offered by our account. For example, if a behaviour such as a preference reversal is not understood (and we contest that it is not) then although it is possible to modify behaviour by adding dominated choices to change the context, this does not explain why the behaviour change occurs. Furthermore, people may rapidly adapt to the changed priors that are a consequence of changing the relationship between context and outcome. If, instead, the causal determinants of the behavior are understood then there is considerably greater scope for designing interventions by modifying key constraints and assessing the impact of those interventions.

Specifically, the impact can be split into the following two categories: 
1. Academic: The project aims to transform the perspective in the Psychology &amp;amp; Behavioural Economics literature, by placing the emphasis on optimal (under constraints) rather than suboptimal behaviour. It will provide the basis for a stimulating a new agenda for social science research and offer a unifying framework that brings together a disparate body of phenomena in JDM research. To realise this impact we will disseminate our work at national and international conferences, propose symposia at these conferences and write further funding applications.
2. Socio-economic: The project will provide a rigorous framework for designing and testing behavioural change interventions. This will lead to greater understanding the causal factors underpinning a range of decisions with socio-economic impact, for example sustainable consumption and healthy life styles or to promote better personal finance/financial investment decisions. To realise this potential we will establish contact with the Behavioural Insights Team at the cabinet office ('the nudge unit') and the financial institution AXA to disseminate our results and promote the proposed framework.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200924</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presentation at Cognitive Sciences Society Meeting, Quebec, Canada 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B4D84A9-D08C-409F-BECE-C88A0EDE2C29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Considerable interest in the results presented on the poster.

As testament to the strength of this work and potential for transformative impact, note that it is currently in press at Psychological Review. 

However, it is still too early for these findings to translate to direct non-academic economic or societal impacst. In addition due to the lack of a dedicated follow-on funding scheme after the end of our award the progress we made was halted. We will now look to engage non-academic stakeholders and make them aware of our research findings. In particular Dr. Warren is in contact with Simon Bentholm a partner at kl.7 a Danish Behavioural Design company (http://kl7.dk/en).

This notion has also been popularised through the media (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26258662) and popular science books (e.g. Thinking fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman; Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, etc). Our transformative award has allowed us to build a compelling argument that this perspective is incorrect. Contrary to the idea of flawed JDM, we provide evidence that humans actually perform as well as possible, provided certain cognitive limitations are taken into account. Under this framework we have developed predictive accounts (and supporting data) for two examples of so-called cognitive bias - phenomena which have presented strong challenges to the notion of rationality in human JDM: i) Contextual Preference Reversals (CPR) (preferences for one of two options are changed by addition of seemingly irrelevant third option); ii) The Gambler's Fallacy (GF) (tendency to believe a head becomes more likely after a long run of tails). 

Primary achievements:
1. We developed a model of human decision making incorporating human unreliability in option evaluation that makes the best decisions it can given this constraint. This model predicts all the contextual preference reversal phenomena and moreover suggests seemingly sub-optimal preference reversals are actually required in order to make the best decision. To our knowledge this is the first genuinely causal model of the CPRs. As testament to the potential of this work to transform the field, the paper describing this model is in press at Psychological Review.

2. We conducted CPR experiments with human participants (in multiple decision making contexts) which are consistent with our account of (cognitively bounded) optimal human decision making in the face of unreliable evaluation of options. 

3. We showed that behaviour in randomness perception experiments is moderated by experience of recently observed environmental statistics, in a manner consistent with our previous account of human randomness perception (Hahn &amp;amp; Warren, 2009). In this account we suggested limitations in short-term memory and/or attention constrain how we experience random events and this would give rise to the GF (Hahn &amp;amp; Warren, 2009). We also suggest the literature has been too hasty to classify participants as prone to GF; the majority of our participants do not express explicit GF-consistent beliefs, even though they exhibit a tendency to generate responses that are implicitly consistent with GF. We suggest such data do not provide robust evidence of erroneous beliefs, but rather sensitivity to environmental statistics

In summary our work provides theoretical and empirical insight to motivate a broad new research agenda in psychology and behavioural economics. We suggest it will be possible to reclassify other irrationality phenomena as rational under appropriate constraints in a unified predictive framework. Through a process of constraint identification and measurement together with modelling, our approach should enable accurate prediction of individual and collective behaviour. Ultimately this should lead to better models of JDM which can be used to guide policy design across a range of contexts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Non-Academics: 
Our models could be developed to predict outcomes of policy changes and/or design interventions to promote advantageous behaviour across a broad set of domains (sustainability, retail/marketing, health, etc). Our recent workshop on randomness perception enabled us to present our findings to stakeholders. These included Prof. Nick Chater, an advisory board member for the UK Behavioural Insights Team (http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk) and we also had extremely positive feedback from a representative of /KL.7, Denmark's leading behavioural design agency (http://kl7.dk/en), which provides behavioural insight consultancy for both private and public bodies (e.g. Danish Road Directorate, Carlsberg). We envisage that such groups are interested in our approach in the long term to help in the design of interventions to change behaviour. 
Academics:
We hope our work should lead to a revision of the accepted view that human JDM is flawed. By demonstrating that two phenomena providing compelling evidence for irrationality might actually be considered rational under appropriate constraints, we suggest that all such phenomena require re-evaluation. We therefore hope the field will therefore adopt a more principled approach to assessing rationality. Our findings also challenge cognitive neuroscientists to identify neural correlates of constraints on performance (e.g. Clark et al., PNAS, 2014)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B7C6F865-25EC-4F2A-8E31-93AF3C5AD362</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b615d4157d0.09417827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a model of human decision making under cognitive constraints which uses the Bayesian framework.
