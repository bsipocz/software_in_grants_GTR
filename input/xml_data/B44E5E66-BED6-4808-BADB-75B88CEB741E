The great insight of Baum and Connes, in the form of their celebrated conjecture, is that certain delicate analytical invariants of a group are intimately related to more tractible geometric invariants, and indeed in many cases these invariants actually coincide. The geometric and analytic invariants are referred to respectively as the LHS and the RHS of the conjecture. The Baum-Connes conjecture is central in the study of non-commutative geometry and has important applications throughout mathematics, implying numerous high profile conjectures including the Novikov Higher Signature Conjecture, the Stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture and the Kadison-Kaplansky Conjecture. The Baum-Connes philosophy also applies in the more flexible world of large-scale metric geometry, where the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture again relates analytical and geometric invariants, in this case in the world of metric spaces.

There has been a significant divide between the approaches used to tackle the Baum-Connes and coarse Baum-Connes conjectures. The former is usually attacked using analytical methods (for instance Rapid Decay, Kasparov's KK-theory) while the latter is investigated using more geometric methods (finite asymptotic dimension, Yu's property A). The recent concept of partial translation algebras bridges the gap between the group and metric space worlds: one can take a group apart and study the pieces geometrically, while still retaining some of the symmetry information that the group structure provides. Decomposing a group geometrically in this way allows the RHS of the Baum-Connes conjecture (the analytical invariant) to be computed in an analogous way to the LHS, and developing this approach is the purpose of this project.

The Baum-Connes conjecture for SL(3,Z) is a famous open problem, and tackling this is an ambitious aim of the project. Previous attempts to solve the problem have failed, as SL(3,Z) is not susceptible to the analytical methods mentioned above. The technology of translation structures provides a new way to examine the group C*-algebra, by computing invariants for subspaces of a group. The foundation of the project is to develop and study the ideas of Baum, Connes et al in this new framework, providing an armoury of new tools to tackle longstanding open problems which are of international interest.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Research in the area of Pure Mathematics is primarily of importance to other mathematicians, who will be the main beneficiaries of the research. The Baum-Connes conjecture has a remarkably wide and far-reaching range of applications thoughout mathematics, including the Novikov conjecture in topology, the stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture in geometry, and the idempotent conjecture in representation theory. The interest and impact of studying the Baum-Connes conjecture therefore spans vast areas of mathematics. The conjecture also has connections with quantization and therefore also has implications for theoretical physics.

The PI is a coinvestigator on grant EP/G059101/1 &amp;quot;Preventing wide-area blackouts through adaptive islanding of transmission networks.&amp;quot; The techniques developed by the PI and his collaborators to study topics related to the Baum-Connes conjecture and property A have already been invaluable with this interdisciplinary project, and while the proposed research project is Pure in nature, the diversity of the palette of mathematical tools being employed will provide a further source of inspiration for the applied project.

An important aspect of this grant proposal is the funding of a post-doctoral researcher to collaborate with the PI. This will provide the PDRA with an opportunity to further their academic career. The Pure Mathematics Group within the School of Mathematics at Southampton provides an excellent environment for developing young researchers, as evidenced by the number of PDRAs here currently, and the past successes of junior researchers within the group, including the PI. Supporting early career researchers in this exciting and growing area of mathematics is very important to the continuing position of the UK at the forefront of mathematical research.

To maximise the impact of the research, the results will be made available on open-access repositories including the arXiv, prior to their publication in leading international journals. The PI and PDRA will also publicise the results by giving seminars and colloquia at universities and conferences both nationally and internationally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100466</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The purpose of the grant was to examine ways to compute invariants (namely K-theory) of certain geometrically constructed algebras.
