The two countries have a long and established civil nuclear industry; producing legacy sites and materials which will need to be managed. There is a clear imperative, given the needs of both new build reactors and legacy wastes, to develop innovative approaches to waste management and decommissioning for safe and cost effective answers to storage and disposal issues. 
 The treatment of radioactive effluent streams is one of the common yet challenging tasks facing almost all nuclear facilities, whether active plants or decommissioning sites. Various liquid streams from cooling ponds to fuel reprocessing require immediate processing to reduce the activity for safe discharge. While low efficiency removal routes in on-going plant operations can lead to long term environmental accumulation in land and sea, the sudden release of mobile radioactive ions can lead to severe environmental contamination. The acute difficulties of treating large volumes of effluent following major nuclear incidents such as Fukushima, highlights the requirements for new flexible technology. The release of cesium-137 (137Cs) and strontium-90 (90Sr) in particular pose substantial safety and environmental concern due to their high fission yield and significant half-lives (t1/2 ~ 29 years). Once released into the biosphere there is a high potential for the fission products to undergo a series of chemical and geochemical processes that ultimately impact human health. Methods to assist in remediation face substantial scientific and engineering challenges associated with: i) complex interactions between the fission products and the environment, and ii) the requirement to process large volumes of waste. 
 In this UK-Republic of Korea project, a new concept based on dual-bubble flotation and magnetic separation will be studied to treat radioactively (Cs and Sr) contaminated environments. The 3-stage process: i) Cs+ and Sr2+ adsorption, ii) heterogeneous-bubble nucleation and flotation, and iii) magnetic separation and volume reduction will proceed in series to transform large waste volumes into small waste packages suitable for interim storage. 
 Surface wettability-based flotation is chosen as the most appropriate method for remediation due to its versatility and applicability for processing large waste volumes. In combination with hydrodynamic cavitation, the process will be capable of separating contaminated particles (fine clays and magnetic carriers) from the unwanted gangue to produce a froth that can be further treated by applying a magnetic field to control the rate of froth destabilization, but also and quite importantly control the overall volume of the waste package. 
 The research will lay scientific foundation for developing revolutionary technology to treat environmentally contaminated land (aqueous and soils). The scientific/engineering approach has the potential to develop a technological step-forward for global decommissioning programmes and the remediation of legacy nuclear sites, such that the footprint of nuclear power has no long lasting impact on the environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The longer term impact will be realized through the development of a revolutionary technology for the clean-up of environmentally contaminated effluent and soils resulting from the unwanted release of radioactive material. The capability to treat environmental contamination, in a flexible semi-continuous system as the one proposed (dual-bubble flotation and magnetic volume reduction), is extremely pertinent when considering the recent incident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, as well as the large scale national decommissioning programme active within the United Kingdom (decommissioning Sellafield ~&amp;pound;70 B over the next +100 years) and soon to be active in the Republic of Korea. It is envisaged through a technological step-forward, that the footprint of nuclear power will have no long lasting impact on the environment. 
 The ambitious research programme will lay scientific foundation for developing revolutionary technology to treat various contaminated streams. The scientific leadership will feed directly into the nuclear industry (Sellafield Ltd - please see the Letter of Support) and the remediation supply chain (SMEs) eventually facilitating technology demonstration at the pilot plant and plant scale. Scale-up to produce magnetic carrier particles suitable for flotation and possible technology transfer will be conducted in partnership with Nano Technology (please see the Letter of Support).
 Through ingenious design of experiments the research knowledge generated will have impact in the wider scientific (academic and industrial) community, in particular colloids and surface chemistry, and DISTINCTIVE, an EPSRC funded collaboration considering the long-term management strategy of the UK waste inventories. At a higher level, knowledge generated in fine particle flotation would support the ongoing challenges in mining where, depletion of easy processing minerals to meet the ever-growing world population and improved life standards has resulted in th exploration of low grade mineral deposits that require fine grinding to liberate the valuables (production of fine particles).
 The scientific and technological impact will be delivered through several routes. Firstly, academic engagement with the nuclear industry will initially be directed through established links such as the UofL-Sellafield Ltd Sludge Centre of Expertise, and the recently established Centre of Nuclear Security and Non-proliferation for research and outreach to public and governmental bodies (KAIST). Secondly, the collaborative programme between the UofL (UK) and KAIST (Republic of Korea) will be used as a springboard to establish a pan Asian-UK nexus. It is hoped that connections can be further grown, enabling a wide base of academic knowledge transfer (research and education) between partners for the mutual benefit for all countries in the Asia-Pacific region linked with the UK. Thirdly, the programme investigators will share their findings with the nuclear supply chain, in particular SMEs. Partnering with an SME and securing further development funding (for example, Innovate UK) will advance the TRL and create opportunity for pilot plant trails (technology demonstration). Finally, dissemination of research findings to the wider scientific community will be achieved by publishing in high impact journals such as Langmuir and Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, with an aim to publish the process research in industry relevant journals such as Nuclear Future and The Chemical Engineer.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>317663</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Korea, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>KAIST</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5400C04-084B-4D75-9BFE-BC6A0404EE7D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Kim, Y.K., T.

1) Synthesized organo-clay-KCuHCF composite particles for enhanced Cs+ uptake and adsorption capacity (Qm = 206 mg/g). For clay composites, the adsorption capacity is more than double previously reported in the literature.
2) Adsorption capacity of the clay particle is enhanced due to the novel organic synthesis route developed in the current study.
3) Organic modification increases the particle wettability and enables easy recovery of composite particles by flotation. Recovery of over 80% achieved compared to 15% for pristine clay. 
Paper 2(to be submitted July 2017)
1) Cs+ uptake and adsorption isotherm determined via AAS. Critical condition for surface contamination identified and verified by a range of techniques including XPS, EDX and zeta potential. 
2) Chemical screening completed to determine a suitable collector to interact only with clay particles that are contaminated by Cs+ (surface level contamination). 
3) Batch flotation studies have shown 1-2% recovery of pristine clay, compared to over 60% recovery of Cs+ contaminated clay. The substantial difference in separation performance confirms that surface contaminated particles can be retrieved from soils to reduce waste volume and decontaminate land. 
Paper 3 (to be submitted late 2017)
1) Synthesis of porous carbon for Sr2+ adsorption by ion exchange. Boron-doped porous carbon (BPC) is first synthesized and then sulfonated in a reaction with sulfuric acid. Sr2+ removal efficiency greater than 80% from aqueous environments. Adsorption capacity almost 20 mg/g, with adsorption rate and capacity mostly independent of environmental conditions, pH and water chemistry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Discussions with Atkins are ongoing (http://www.atkinsglobal.com/en-gb) with a potential view to trial the technology at pilot scale.
