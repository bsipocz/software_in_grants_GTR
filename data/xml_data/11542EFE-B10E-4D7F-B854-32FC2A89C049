Drawing on feminist and sociological critiques of the disembodied status of 'objective' research, many scholars have called for new approaches that trouble or overturn the assumed hierarchy of theory over practice. Theorists of theatre, dance and performance have made important contributions to these discussions by showing how performative forms such as songs and dances can 'function as vital acts of transfer, transmitting social knowledge' (Taylor 2003: 2-3), while scholars in cultural and religious studies have similarly analyzed martial arts, yoga, and other practices of physical culture as modes of 'embodied knowledge' (Farrer and Whalen-Bridge 2011). This project takes the concept of embodied knowledge a step further by proposing that embodied practice in a focused laboratory setting can be a site of knowledge production as well as transmission, leading to substantial research outcomes in the form of new technique.

The project will use the sociology of scientific knowledge, and specifically the subfield of laboratory studies, to revitalize the twentieth-century concept of the 'theatre laboratory', leading to the development of a robust methodology for embodied research. A key criterion for defining and assessing such research is the precise specification of the area of embodied technique to be investigated. In this case, the core object of research is the technique of 'song-action', an embodied approach to song that includes dynamic psychophysical action and interaction as well as vocal musicality. In today's world of ubiquitous sound recording, we are used to thinking of songs as audio tracks subject to infinite duplication. The previous technological era understood songs as written scores. This project returns to a more primary understanding of songs as cultivated organic resources within the bodies of individuals and groups. It defines 'song-action' as the dynamic intersection of a particular type of song - in this case, the Jewish piyutim and nigunim - with psychophysical action in the sense developed by twentieth-century pioneers of acting Konstantin Stanislavski and Jerzy Grotowski.

The core of the project is six months of full-time embodied research involving three skilled practitioners in a studio laboratory. The practitioners will have advanced competency in the technique of song (natural and extended voice and musicality) and action (movement, physical culture, psychophysical scores) and will work together to systematically chart and explore the practical possibilities for psychophysical action defined by the vocal structures of the selected songs. As embodied technique, singing is much more than just rhythm, melody, and lyrics, even if these are its essential foundation. Individual songs, especially when learned through oral tradition or audio recordings, also define structures of breath, vocal resonance qualities (timbre or color), and many other subtle aspects of the embodied voice that are not well captured by western musical notation. The core phase of embodied research will be supported by dramaturgical and musicological research and the PI will maintain and expand relationships with mentors working in Jewish studies and music.

The laboratory practice will model best practices of documentation and transparency as they pertain to embodied laboratory research. Its results will be shared through live research presentations in the United Kingdom, United States, and Poland; a concluding interdisciplinary symposium; a collection of raw documentation files; and a series of print and digital multimedia publications that explore the concrete findings and epistemological implications of this new approach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will explicitly target two main communities for impact: professional performing artists and diasporic Jewish communities. A provisional list of institutions to be targeted in each of the six cities to be visited is included under Pathways to Impact. Additional impact beneficiaries will include the academic publishing industry and, indirectly, other communities that link cultural identity and performing arts.

1) Through presentations in theatrical venues across three countries, the project will share its innovative approach to embodied research and inspire artists to think differently about the epistemic content and context of their work. The PI has long-standing contacts with performing arts institutions in the identified cities that particularly support process-based and exploratory work, such as Movement Research in New York City and the Grotowski Institute in Wroclaw, Poland. The use of the term 'research' by these organizations indicates their affinity with the questions explored by the project and their desire to develop new connections between academic and artistic research.

2) The project will serve the interests of Jewish diasporic communities by offering a new way of thinking about the role of embodied technique in the creation, transformation, and transmission of identity. Questions of identity and heritage are always at issue for diasporic communities and Jewish thinkers in particular have long formulated questions about the meaning of Judaism and Jewishness in diasporic contexts. In Poland and the northeast United States, the past few decades have witnessed a resurgence of interest in Jewish music and ritual practice among both Jews and non-Jews, as evidenced by organizations like the LABA Laboratory for Jewish Culture in New York City, the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw (curated by performance scholar Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett), and the Wroclaw Centre for Jewish Culture and Education. The PI will work with these institutions and others to coordinate community events that provoke new ways of thinking about Jewish identity in the contemporary world.

Academic and commercial publishers will benefit from the project's innovative approach to documentation and dissemination. It is well known that publishers today are grappling with issues raised by digital and open source technologies. One of the key questions is how publishers can add value to digital content through editorial and annotative framing and metadata. The PI currently serves as an informal advisor to the Routledge Performance Archive and will feed project outcomes into its upcoming redesign process. More broadly, the creative forms of digital publication that emerge from this project will provide a reference point for discussions about the future of digital knowledge transmission.

Finally, there are many other culturally, ethnically and religiously defined communities in which the relationship between performing arts, embodied practice, and identity are urgently at issue today. These discussions usually articulate themselves in the language of identity, arts, culture, tradition and heritage, but in many cases such communities are increasingly looking for ways to understand cultural identity and heritage in terms of embodied knowledge and shared, transmissible practice. Through its specific focus on Jewish cultural materials and the technique of song-action, this project opens the way for other investigations into culture as knowledge and as performance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183174</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>13F4220A-F854-4D48-A1B2-29D181B5774E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Colors Like Knives: Embodied Research and Phenomenotechnique in</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Contemporary Theatre Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5c9ff63a6bb3d509ff27018ed7f8f579"><gtr:id>5c9ff63a6bb3d509ff27018ed7f8f579</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spatz B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc4ea4418d2.41927900</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E8A25C36-18B1-4525-B4EC-563925C216F2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The video way of thinking</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>South African Theatre Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5c9ff63a6bb3d509ff27018ed7f8f579"><gtr:id>5c9ff63a6bb3d509ff27018ed7f8f579</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spatz B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a65aee97702e1.08065450</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EF2EEC73-2457-404E-B100-D4EB81B924AE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Epistemic objects</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theatre, Dance and Performance Training</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5c9ff63a6bb3d509ff27018ed7f8f579"><gtr:id>5c9ff63a6bb3d509ff27018ed7f8f579</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spatz B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a82c77a220227.80041997</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N006879/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C3FAF999-8402-446C-8A80-016962744E22</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epistemology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F354373F-6BF5-4763-845E-4A4681AE3A8F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4DC83A15-ACD4-4667-BA6F-2DB8EFCF166F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theories Of Theatre</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D417837F-1924-4F1E-875B-A160B88B4C98</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Traditional Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
