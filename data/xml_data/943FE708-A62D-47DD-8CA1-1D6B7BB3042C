How do we get better at sharing personal stories and oral histories in ways that build community as well as creating new academic insights? How can we harness the evocative power of lifelong objects and the communicative and archiving potential of digital technologies? 

The UK population is ageing with the fastest population increases in the numbers of those aged 85 and over. It is projected that by 2035 those aged 65 and over will account for 23% of the total population whilst the number of people aged 85 and over will reach 3.5 million accounting for 5 per cent of the total UK population. These changes have wide ranging implications for our communities, our family relationships, the institutions that are important to us, and concerns related to health and well-being and social trust and isolation. The care home market is growing exponentially creating new communities of circumstance of older people coming together from diverse backgrounds and with unique experiences. Pressing questions arise about how we might create 'community' in these settings and what role oral/life history collection and sharing might play in this process.

Our technical development process will involve our interdisciplinary team working with older people to co-design a desirable interface where familiar objects themselves control the interaction. We will augment the objects by associating the oral history digitally to the object. The interface will be designed such that it will be possible for older people, in conversation with their families and/or care home workers, to 'self' curate and input their own stories with minimal interaction with the technology. The look and feel of the interface, as well as its functionality, will be co-produced with older people following an approach based on user-centric, rapid prototyping in collaboration with artists and computer scientists.

In the move to a care home lifelong objects may sometimes get lost or misplaced, given away or sold. We will work with an artist-maker experienced in designing beautiful tangible objects to produce a range of 3D 'proxies' for the objects based on categorisations developed in the early stages of the research and design process. Through ownership of the physical augmented object, each individual will have tangible control over who is able to access their memory; whether they want to keep hold of the augmented object for personal use or whether they are willing to share their object with family, friends or others in their care home or beyond it.

Bringing together an interdisciplinary team including social historians, digital artists and makers, learning researchers, computer scientists, older people themselves and registered therapists we will co-produce a set of new digital tools that will address some of the key societal challenges concerning the care and well-being of older people and the legacy of the memories and stories that they leave for future generations. We are interested in exploring the way that smart objects and the internet of things might be developed in both historical research and in democratic community building.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academics (see Academic Beneficiaries) Our research team will benefit by developing expertise and knowledge in working with older people living in care homes- a growing group of the population. For our early career researchers this will increase their chances of securing employment. The research team will also develop expertise in managing co-produced research and a user centred technological design process over a relatively long period.

Oral historians, museums and art galleries would be able to use our assets to improve the collection and communication of oral histories in relation to objects/stories in or arising from their collections and archives. Our assets would also enable them to explore self curation of stories and objects.

Health professionals: Our methodologies for collecting life histories through objects will be of interest to community health professionals such as occupational and art therapists working with older people. Care home managers, owners and staff who are struggling to cope with new regulations and guidance on person centred care and individual care planning will find our digital assets and training manuals useful in developing a robust well-being policy.

Older people and their families and friends: The project will provide them with a set of assets that will help them to share memories and leave a (digital) legacy of their lives. Sharing life stories with care home staff has been proven to improve the care and quality of life that they receive. The project will also support older people to engage with digital technologies and to consider questions around their digital afterlives.

Internet service providers and social media companies (both large and small) will learn more about older people and their families views on privacy and security after death which may inform the design of new policies and new products.

Local and community history groups: may find the sharable memories recorded useful and informative for their work. 

Schools: may find the sharable oral histories useful in supporting intergenerational exchange and enabling young people to consider events and responses to them in the past in order to think about their own responses in the present and future.

Policy makers at a local and national level: will be interested in our findings related to the care of our increasing ageing population, plus concerns around digital inclusion and quality of life in relation to older people living in care homes.

Charities and pressure groups: will find data and assets that can support their work to unsettle deeply held assumptions about older people and their contribution to society and improve the lives of older people living in care homes.

Digital artists and designers: working on cutting edge tangible interface design and technical object identification methodologies will be able to access our code and project specifications.

Product designers and creative technologists interested in making technologies that are accessible for older people will be interested in our findings during our process of iterative interface design and co-production with older people.

Alive! and organisations like them will have new tools to develop their workshop portfolio and training sessions for care home staff.

Other institutions, such as prisons and hospitals might benefit from our assets and methods including hospital wards for long term sick people, such as those for people with anorexia or institutions that help people who have suffered from abuse.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>383712</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;To the Seaside&amp;quot;, an embedded tangible score developed by creative technologist and sculptor Steve Symons. This wooden prototype plays nature sounds and music when it is picked up, tapped, shaken, smoothed and generally explored through touch. The top surface is embedded with pebbles and pieces of wood and conceals the network of electronics and programming that is hidden inside. Underneath, on the base of the prototype is a discreet speaker.

A tangible score is a physical computer based musical instrument where marks and other elements that make the instrument's control surface also act as some form or graphical musical notation and so suggest how it is played. In this way the tangible score becomes a very specific novel instrument for musical expression (NIME) and has a sense of sonic narrative built into its design. 

&amp;quot;To the Seaside&amp;quot; uses these principles to create an embedded tangible score, one where the sound processing and speaker system are integrated into the body of the score itself. The body smooth and is designed to reminiscent of sand worn wood and the playing surface is made from textures and objects that represent being at the seaside. Sandpaper, shells, small stones are all set into the wooden surface using a grey mud like compound. These objects act as the interface as they are touched and stroked. 

Observations showed caressing and repeated stroking of interesting surfaces as being a common habit in the care centre and these actions become the driving force in the work. Sounds are triggered by touching the surface and objects. The intention is to extend this in the next version and have a sense of narrative that is moved through by use. The aim is to create an object that can be used either as part of a directed activity and used to stimulate conversation, but also as a comforting experiential object.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AC943F0B-A555-4A65-8419-2BA47C104B74</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From fieldnotes...
One of the first participants to visit us in the Garden Room was a resident who is new to Deerhurst and just settling in. Betty was a very jovial character who really enjoyed shaking the handheld prototype and touching the different textures of embedded stone and wood. On contact with her hands and triggered by the movement, the sound of seagulls started squawking at Betty. She laughed and joked that the birds must be hungry 'because we were mean and had forgotten to feed them!'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c028c4955aa7.24643329</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>To the Seaside: Tangible score</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://tangible-memories.com/1144-2/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Booklet published for the V &amp;amp; A Digital Design weekend event.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3ADB7BE5-9E1B-4A71-AFCE-F92D4636EF7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Distributed at the event to over 2000 people.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d996922708b1.84010813</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Crafting our digital future</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>AHRC tenth anniversary film made about the Tangible Memories project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>88AF93D8-64E8-46B5-8D7B-0CD3797F2201</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lot of interest in the project from across the globe.

This first pair of Mutual Instruments are handheld networked instruments that create a musical chatroom where the two players can improvise musically together in a structured manner and have been designed with the following intentions: 

1) to provide stimulation through musical activity (even if non musician user),
2) to create a potentially isolating/comforting environment,
3) to allow for local networked engagement,
4) to remain musically coherent with minimal learning and experience,
5) to be tangible rather than screen orientated.

Musically the instrument is built around a backing track that divided into musical phases which are designed to act as a framing device for the interaction which is limited to 4 buttons. In the current version each button simply plays a preloaded sample both locally and on the remote partner device. The composer can choose whether a sample is played immediately a trigger happens or for it to be snapped to the next beat.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B410A38F-B3B5-48AA-A936-9E503112CC54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At Brigstow showcase event much engagement with new audiences who played the instruments together.

At the Teenage Cancer Trust we tested the mutual instruments and many patients and families and friends said they felt this would make an important contribution to their quality of life when in hospital, especially when undoing difficult procedures or needing to be in isolation - as it enables people to interact with others musically who might not be in the same room.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c02a50b283e0.10719602</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Mutual Instruments</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://tangible-memories.com/nature-technology-wellbeing/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Interactive books co-designed with residents living in care homes</gtr:description><gtr:id>C217275F-7656-4AA3-9F8F-59283A116430</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Residents in care homes that we are working with have increased their confidence as they have worked along side us to develop these books.

A two-day workshop for doctoral researchers who are already using or have decided to use creative research methods drawn from visual, arts-based, performative, participatory and narrative forms. The focus was on providing expert input from across the SWDTC institutions in order to:

1. Provide hands-on workshop experience of how to use particular methods and how to analyse data that emerge;
2. Develop networks across the SWDTC of doctoral researchers and academic staff who are experienced in creative methods in order to build confidence in researchers to better articulate and justify approaches and to share methodological expertise in an emergent community of practice;
3. Provide reflective spaces for doctoral researchers supported by academic staff to consider utility, efficacy and ways of judging rigour and value of creative methods in research;
4.

New methods of co-design and co-production have been used to engage care managers and staff and older people themselves in multisensory activities. The work has involved co-designing innovative new tangible technologies which have led to new training programmes for care staff delivered throughout the south and south west, as well as an improvement in the quality of care, and a decrease in social isolation and loneliness in the care settings in which we have worked.

The work has been widely disseminated thereby facilitating the scaling up of the impact throughout the south and south west and potentially nationally. 

In depth staff training has been delivered to 20 care staff in 3 settings in Bristol. Alive Activities (our community partner) have now integrated this training into their offer and in 2016 will be delivering staff training on our approach to improving quality of life to approximately 2500 further care staff through their regular training sessions and through their online Active Care Forum. This work is continuing and growing through our latest project Parlours of Wonder where we aim to train around 60 new care staff in using the technologies and delivering intergenerational activities.

So far we have had 1352 downloads of our StoryCreator app, internationally
Our twitter feed has over 300 followers and is growing daily
Our website has had 29,352 hits as of today (8th March, 2017)

We know from evidence we have collected from residents, including personal letters and emails that the project has directly improved their quality of life. For instance, they have told us that 'taking part in the project has given me a new lease of life and has helped restore my confidence.' Another resident wrote that, 'One thinks there's nothing left - you need someone to show you it isn't all over.'

The research has been showcased at the Connected Communities Festivals in 2014 and 2015 where at least 100 practitioners and policy makers came to discuss the project with us over 3 days. As a result of our work there we were interviewed for a short film about the project which featured on the AHRC Youtube site and garnered 209 views. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFeLwvQeooY

The project also became the subject of an AHRC short film to celebrate the AHRC Centenary. This film was only put online in September 2015 and has already garnered over 100 views.

We were invited to show our installation and our prototypes at the Digital Design Weekend at the V &amp;amp; A and will return there next year to showcase the follow on funded project. The project also featured in two publications, &amp;quot;Big Data in the Arts and Humanities' AHRC and 'Crafting Our Digital Futures.' (V &amp;amp; A Digital Design Weekend publication). Over 3,000 booklets were distributed during the two days of the Digital Design weekend and estimate that numbers passing through the galleries were in excess of 9,000 people.

PUBLIC POLICY 
At the Thinking Futures Festival 2014 (ESRC Festival of Social Science) we ran an event entitled 'Care Homes of the Future' in a city centre venue. 54 people came including policy makers, civil society organisations, members of the public, academics and older people themselves. As a result of this event we wrote a Policy Briefing for Policy Bristol which went on their website and was distributed widely.

As a result of the profile of the project and the work, showcases through these various events Helen Manchester (PI) has been asked to sit on the Evidence and Evaluation board of Bristol Ageing Better consortium, advising on how to evaluate the Bristol Ageing Better work that is aiming to improve the quality of life of older people, reducing social isolation and loneliness of all older residents in the city.

Our team of learning researchers, computer scientists, social historians, practitioners who work with older adults, digital artists and makers are seeking creative ways, using digital technology, to attach these stories to tangible things like personal possessions, handcrafted objects or print-on-demand books.

Working with older people at every stage, these new digital tools are designed to help address some of the challenges facing people living in care homes. Through creating tangible digital resources such as memory objects and digital books we are supporting them to build stronger communities through sharing stories with each other and enabling them to leave a legacy of their memories for future generations.

We have found that harnessing the power of innovative tangible technologies in care settings can impact directly on relationships of care, on intra-generational relationships between residents themselves and on intergenerational relationships between residents and their families and friends. The 3 care homes in which we have worked (one extra care facility, one dementia care facility and one private care home with mixed residents) have seen the effects of the use of these technologies first hand and all are keen to take on our technologies and develop their use in their settings. We want to continue to work alongside them to pilot their ideas.


Significant Achievements
a) Our research and co-design work has produced a range of technological prototypes that we have tested in care home settings. Our prototypes include:
? An app that enables residents to work with families or care staff to create their own interactive life history books or group history books (with audio and video triggered by visual recognition software) ultimately linked to print on demand services
? An interactive rocking chair that enables residents to listen to audio including sounds of nature (eg the sound of the sea), poems and favourite music
? A tactile cushion which can be programmed to play favourite music or audio stories - personalized for individual residents, using visual recognition software
? The use of Virtual Reality headsets that can transport residents to places they are no longer able to visit

a) We have developed close and mutual relationships with a series of organisations, social care providers, policy makers and small businesses who want to work with us to take our ideas forward. These partners include: Age UK, Hanover Housing (social housing provider), Alive!, Stand and Stare (interactive design company), Heidi Hinder (Artist), BrunelCare and various care homes across the Southwest.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our partners in care homes are keen to create a space or room in their setting where everyone can use our technologies together. They have suggested that there is huge potential to use these spaces as 'community hubs' where children from local schools, community groups and isolated older people living in the community might be encouraged to come and enjoy a cup of tea and a chat or a more formal encounter and where residents can meet together and with others to explore their memories and discuss their current lives and hopes for the future. We are calling these spaces 'Parlours of Wonder'. Our vision is that these spaces will be run by and for residents, care staff, families and community members.

We are looking for follow on funding (and have applied to the AHRC follow on fund) for this project to develop our ideas with the care homes we've already been working with but also to extend the project reach to explore how our technologies can be cost effectively and practically used across more care settings nationally. This work will involve writing training plans and toolkits, developing sustainable staffing models, and building up a suite of approaches to engage residents, staff and those in the local community within the Parlours. 

Where do we want to be in 12 months?
? We will have co-designed and produced innovative training materials and guidance for care home residents and staff, families and organisations such as Alive! activities to use our technologies and to design their own Parlours of Wonder.
? We will have developed a robust version of the app, Android and Apple, which will be freely available on iStore and through Google Play. 
? We will have explored manufacturing routes for the chair, cushion and variations of these audio experiences and created either i) a DIY guide using readily available equipment from online retailers or ii) a manufacturing partnership with an existing consortium partner or a new partner (e.g. a supplier of care home equipment or specialist products for the elderly)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>34D06307-495D-4DF8-9404-88A9D4E5775C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cc516315b42.88252115</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.tangible-memories.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Policy makers speed dating event</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A51AC22-C24D-4572-B50D-4101AA159175</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a60fcd53e3.66106935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of Bristol living better at every age group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEE951FE-905B-49F5-B4D9-A4B8BB7BD348</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c014663c1e61.43456968</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://bristolageingbetter.org.uk/news/age-friendly-city-project-update/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Bristol Ageing Better Evidence and Evaluation group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DAF9CD40-B400-402E-B465-0B00AA5F865F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a member of the evidence and evaluation group of Bristol Ageing Better I am involved in ensuring that the team employed to evaluate this &amp;pound;6million national lottery funded project is done with due diligence and to the advantage of the city, older people and the Bristol Ageing Better programme which is charged with tackling the issues of isolation and loneliness amongst older people in the city.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99431c9b835.27313068</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://bristolageingbetter.org.uk/about/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Tangible Memories app allows you to tell stories that are meaningful to you and your loved ones, and listen back to them in easy and accessible ways. It has been designed particularly with older people and their carers and families in mind, but can be used by anyone.

You can create pages that combine a photo, text and an audio recording. These can be viewed within the app or printed out. When printed, the audio recording is represented by a beautiful shell illustration. The scan function within the app recognizes the shell on each printed page and, as if by magic, plays back your audio.

As well as printing out PDF pages, the shells can be printed onto other things such as cushions or lap blankets. Music is well known to be therapeutic for dementia sufferers and can be a powerful way to access memories. We have also found that people with dementia often enjoy the feel of tactile fabrics. You can use the app to link a piece of music to a shell. When that shell is printed out (this could be onto a range of materials) you can use the scan function to play back that piece of music. This enables people to create blankets and objects to touch and feel that contain play lists that are meaningful to them.

- A simple design that allows you to make an audio recording, add a photo and a short quote
- A function that allows you to swipe through pages you have created as an e-book within the app and play back your audio on each page
- An export option, which allows you to email a PDF of each page to share with others or print out
- A 'scan' function that, using image recognition, allows you to play back audio recordings from your printed pages by framing the shell illustrations within the viewfinder
- Options to record audio within the app or use tracks from your iTunes library
- Options to take photos through the app or add them from your photo library
- As well as printing out PDF pages, the shells can be printed onto other things such as cushions or lap blankets.
- iTunes file sharing, enabling the user to copy their created book from the iPad to their computer as a backup option. Copied books can also be imported onto another iPad running the Tangible Memories app.
