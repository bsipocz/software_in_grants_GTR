fertility and health</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/K017810/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project is focussed on the health, productivity and welfare of sheep. We will concentrate on aspects of metabolism that affect lifelong health and wellbeing. Specifically, we will study a key aspect of metabolism referred to as one-carbon (1C) metabolism. This is important because it affects many key processes in the cell, including DNA synthesis, DNA methylation and cell proliferation. It does this by delivering methyl groups, which are central to these biochemical reactions. Deficiencies in metabolites involved in these pathways, such as choline, methionine, folate and vitamin B12, have adverse effects on animal development and wellbeing. For example, deficiencies in vitamin B12 and/or folate can affect fertility and fetal development, and lead to poor growth, vascular disease and metabolic syndrome in adult animals and humans. 1C metabolism pathways are complex and are affected by many genes. We hypothesise that mutations in these genes will affect 1C metabolism and the vulnerability of animals to micronutrient deficiencies. In this study we will identify such mutations, determine their functional significance (i.e. what they do and how important they are), test their impact in animals fed different diets, and find ways to use this information to improve the welfare of farm animals.

Firstly, we will identify mutations (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) in around 40 genes directly affecting 1C metabolism, and in very closely related pathways involved in energy metabolism, cell proliferation, DNA synthesis and DNA methylation. To achieve this in sheep we will create our own sequence data. We estimate that we will identify 2000-4000 SNPs by these methods. 

We will then conduct a large-scale study with liver samples collected from around 300 sheep slaughtered at local abattoirs. We will genotype each sample (to determine which SNPs are present), measure gene expression and conduct a comprehensive analysis of all metabolites involved in 1C metabolism. Interpretation of these data will inform us on SNP function and how these SNPs affect pathways involved in 1C metabolism. To achieve this we will collate the required information and, using our knowledge of these genomes combined with complex bioinformatic analyses, determine the subset of SNPs that have the greatest impact on 1C metabolism. We expect to identify an estimated 100 or so functionally significant SNPs in these genes. We will then construct a 'SNP chip'; i.e. a tool to genotype sheep simultaneously and cheaply for many SNPs. 

This chip will be used to screen several flocks of sheep to identify 24 'Low-risk' and 24 'High-risk' weaned lambs, and 24 'Low-risk' and 24 'High-risk' breeding ewes. We will then monitor these animals in separate studies involving Control and Methyl-Deficient diets (i.e. two genotypes by two diets). For weaned lambs we will focus on effects on growth, animal health and liver metabolism, and carcass yields and composition. For breeding ewes we will also focus on animal health and liver metabolism, but extend studies to consider effects on chemical modifications to DNA (i.e. DNA methylation) in early (Day 16) male and female embryos. 

This research will provide novel insights into nutrient x gene interactions for many components of 1C metabolism and how they affect (a) lamb production efficiency, health and welfare, and (b) early development of mammalian embryos influencing fertility and the long-term health and wellbeing of offspring. We will be able to use this information to help breed animals with better functioning 1C metabolism (leading to permanent improvements in welfare and productivity) and/or to improve animal diets. As 1C metabolism also influences human development and health our results will also have biomedical research benefits, and increase the utility of sheep as a model species for this type of research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>One-carbon (1C) metabolism delivers methyl groups for use in a plethora of key cellular reactions including DNA synthesis and methylation. Dietary deficiencies in 1C-related metabolites impair lifelong health and wellbeing in humans and farm animals, and reduce farm-animal productivity. We hypothesise that SNPs in genes associated with 1C metabolism alter the sensitivity of animals to micronutrient deficiencies. This project will identify SNPs in 1C metabolism in sheep, determine their functional significance, and confirm their practical relevance in two selection-based nutritional studies involving weaned lambs and breeding ewes. By re-sequencing and data mining, we expect to identify between 2000-4000 SNPs in or near 40 genes encoding enzymes involved in 1C metabolism and closely related pathways related to energy metabolism, cell proliferation, DNA synthesis and DNA/histone methylation. A comprehensive analysis of SNPs, transcripts and all metabolites involved in 1C metabolism will follow using liver samples collected from ca. 300 sheep. Outputs from these experiments will be the source of data for a 'SNP selection' pipeline, to identify an estimated 100 or so functionally significant SNPs, associated with these genes, for chip construction. This chip will be used to screen several sheep flocks to identify 24 'Low-risk' and 24 'High-risk' breeding ewes, and similar groups of lambs, to participate in two separate prospective 2 x 2 factorial studies involving Control and Methyl-Deficient diets. Measureable endpoints will be growth, immune status, liver metabolism and carcass quality (for lambs), liver metabolism and DNA methylation (MBD-Seq) in Day 16 embryonic cells (for breeding ewes). This research will provide novel insights into nutrient x gene interactions for the many components of 1C metabolism with benefits for animal productivity, health and welfare, improving our understanding of how diet can influence long-term epigenetic programming via the germline.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This BBSRC supported Industrial Partnership Award (with three Levy Boards: EBLEX, HCC and AgriSearch) will advance both fundamental and applied knowledge, with primary non-academic beneficiaries being livestock breeders (producers), companies involved in genetic improvement of sheep, the animal feed industry, veterinarians and the animal health-care pharmaceutical industry. However, we anticipate that the development of a validated software pipeline for associating SNPs with specific changes in metabolism will also be of value to human health-care professionals and the human health-care pharmaceutical industry. 

Outputs from this programme (e.g. functional SNP chips, specific dietary advice) may require further industry-sponsored refinement. However, it is probable that specific SNPs in just a few genes will have the greatest influence on 1C metabolism and metabolic outcomes. As this becomes evident so this knowledge can be integrated into practical programmes quickly via the routes outlined below. It is likely that the initial impact of this study will be realised within 3-5 years of project completion, perhaps following further Levy-Board sponsored field-scale studies within the national flock. This is likely to involve a small number of monitor farms where, using Electronic Identification Systems (EID) and following specific pedigrees, we would validate the merits of our approach by (i) quantifying variant-allele frequencies for 1C-metabolism genes and (ii) relating these to measures of animal performance, health and wellbeing. We can also establish a selected resident population of ewes, with contrasting SNP profiles, for future industry-supported studies that could, for example, test the efficacy of pertinent trace-element supplementation strategies at key stages of the life-course (or annual production cycle). This would help identify, for susceptible animals, the most suitable stages of development to mitigate trace-element deficiencies; the efficacy of which would be related to the status of animals identified as being genetically tolerant to such deficiencies.

Differences in digestive metabolism between ruminants and non-ruminants are recognised and, as we have previously demonstrated, can be suitably accommodated when formulating diets. These studies reported similar metabolic responses and developmental effects on insulin resistance in both sheep and rat offspring. Furthermore, we have shown that ewes and women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation during IVF elicit similar ovarian responses to folate status. Following the successful conclusion of the current proposal we would be able to conduct direct interventional studies (whole animal, cell, embryo culture) in sheep to further address the effects of various SNP combinations on metabolic, developmental and epigenetic responses to varied 1C-metabolite status and relate these observations to parallel human studies. In this regard, we can also make use of the validated software pipeline for associating 1C SNPs with specified changes in metabolism in human studies. 

At project completion, and in collaboration with the Levy Boards, we will host seminars/workshops with breed societies from across the UK, to discuss trace-element deficiencies in sheep and the use of contemporary genomic tools to facilitate selection (e.g. via the National Sheep Association (NSA) or via the biennial 'Sheep Breeders Roundtable'). Project completion coincides with the BBSRC Animal Science Forum held in conjunction with the British Society of Animal Science (~500 delegates from industry, the veterinary profession, various public bodies and media). Nottingham also hosts a successful annual meeting (~120 delegates) directed specifically at the animal feed industry. Papers at this meeting are published in the acclaimed series 'Recent Advances in Animal Nutrition', Nottingham University Press. The PI and Co-I Bishop will coordinate these activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>367592</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Wales</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Wales Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience</gtr:department><gtr:description>EU COST Action FA1201 - Epiconcept</gtr:description><gtr:id>526A86F7-D33A-45C0-8BAD-DBC4B20D555A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference 2013, Epigenetics and Periconception Environment, 24-25 April 2013, Antalya, Turkey

The loss of two co-investigators, an initial design fault and a subsequent technical delay from the supplier of custom-SNP arrays meant that we missed our window of opportunity in 2016 to purchase animals necessary for Objective 3.This meant that we required a no-cost extension until November 2017. This extension was granted. 

Objectives as presented in the original application

Objective 1. SNP discovery: The first objective of this proposal set out to identify SNPs in genes encoding key enzymes involved in 1C metabolism and those in closely associated pathways involved in 1C transport, cellular uptake, energy metabolism, DNA synthesis and DNA/histone methylation. Based on analyses of data from comparative species (i.e. human, mouse, cow and pig), we expected to identify 2000 to 4000 SNPs.

Objective 2. Functional significance of SNPs: The aim was to identify which of the identified SNPs, or combinations of SNPs, from Objective 1 led to modifications in 1C metabolism. We have been conducting SNP analysis, comprehensive quantitative metabolic profiling and selective transcript analysis of all key components of 1C metabolism and related pathways (e.g. polyamine and propionate metabolism) in liver samples collected from ca. 300 female sheep (of a single breed) slaughtered at local abattoirs. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis are identifying SNPs and SNP combinations that are functionally significant with respect to 1C metabolic activity. We are currently ranking these SNPs by the extent to which they affect specific components of 1C metabolism, leading to the construction of a functional SNP chip with perhaps as few as ca. 100 SNPs.

Objective 3. Functional consequences study: Now scheduled for 2017. We had intended to apply the information attained from Objectives 1 and 2 in two short-term dietary studies (see later for update). We had intended to use the functional SNP chip (Objective 2) to screen several flocks and select 'Low-risk' and 'High-risk' weaned lambs, and 'Low-risk' and 'High-risk' breeding ewes. Selected animals were to be offered either a Control or Methyl-Deficient (MD) diet for up to 4 months. The MD diet is deficient in elemental cobalt and sulphur, and leads to reduced levels of B12, folate and methionine, and elevated levels of homocysteine in blood. Originally, lamb growth rates, immune status, carcass and saleable meat yields were to be determined and a comprehensive metabolic analysis conducted systemically and in specific tissues (e.g. liver) post mortem undertaken. Ewes were to undergo controlled ovarian stimulation and artificially inseminated using semen from a single ram. Day 16 embryos were to be harvested and developmental stages assessed, sexed by PCR and genome-wide DNA methylation in embryonic discs determined by deep sequencing. 

Progress summary

Personnel: In 2015 we lost two co-investigators from this project. Professor Stephen Bishop (Roslin Institute) sadly passed away in April 2015 following a short illness. Professor Alan Archibald has since assumed the role of local PI in Edinburgh. There were some inevitable delays in Edinburgh during this transitionary period. A further technical delay with supply of custom arrays from Illumina compounded this problem. We subsequently identified a design fault in our custom arrays and had to re-order a new set. These issues meant that we missed the seasonal window for procurement of selected animals which forms part of Objective 3 (see later). Consequently, animal experiments had to be deferred until 2017, and so a no-cost extension was sought and granted. Professor Charlie Hodgman's contract with the University of Nottingham was terminated in November 2015, but we still have received intellectual input from Professor Hodgman in the period since. 

Objective 1: Reported previously in part, full genome sequences were obtained on 20 unrelated Texel ewes. The animals were sequenced in two pools, to a depth of 30X. These data were submitted to the University of Nottingham and passed initial quality control. Reads were mapped to the reference Sheep genome assembly and SNP discovery is now complete. A total of 22,894,749 SNPs have been identified of these are associated with 48,782 gene transcripts. 13,824,954 SNPS are in gene sequences or their regulatory regions and 97,797 cause missense mutations within a total of 25,280 transcripts. Prioritisation of genes containing variants was undertaken (Milestone 1). All discovered SNPs will shortly be deposited into publicly accessible databases in due course. 

Objective 2: Liver tissue samples were collected from 270 pure- and cross-bred Texel lambs (Milestone 3) for metabolomic (Milestone 4), SNP (Milestone 5) and transcript (Milestone 6) analyses; all but the SNP analyses have been completed. Milestones 7 and 8 await the completion of Milestone 5.

Milestone 5: The genotyping of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for the 1 C project has four stages, design and purchase of the custom sheep genotyping array, preparation and QC of the DNA samples, processing of the DNA samples on the arrays and the analysis of the arrays.

The SNP genotyping array (or chip) was redesigned to allow the genotyping of SNPs within or close to the genes of interest, i.e. genes of relevance to 1-carbon metabolism and epigenetic regulator genes that use SAM as a methyl donor. The sequence and sequence variant information was derived from i) the current reference sheep genome (Oar_v3.1), ii) earlier re-sequencing of 24 Texel sheep undertaken within the current project (Objective 1), and iii) SNPs in the public databases (e.g. dbSNP). 5,628 identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were provided to Edinburgh Genomics for final validation. Of these 5,550 passed quality control for SNP design. 257 genes of interest have been captured by the array design. These redesigned arrays were purchase in October 2016 via Edinburgh Genomics. The identified SNPs are dispersed between coding (1,086) and non-coding sequences (130 splice site 684 UTR and 3650 upstream). In preparation for the return of initial genotype data, the functional annotation of variants has begun. Amino acid changing SNPs in coding sequence (452 SNPs, 167 genes) are being tested for effects on structure by prediction of crystal structure of all proteins. To assess the potential impact of non-coding variants, the degree of conservation (variation between mammalian species at each orthologous position with the sheep genome) is being calculated. 

The DNA was prepared from the liver samples supplied to the Edinburgh Genomics facility. The QC of the DNA indicated that the samples were generally acceptable, in that they contain a lot of high molecular weight DNA. All of the samples contain RNA to a certain extent but this has previously been found to have little influence on the assay. Some of the concentrations are lower than would be ideal and these were returned for concentrating to the desired range for the assay.

Milestone 4: New and refined methodologies using LC-MS/MS were development for simultaneous measurements of key one-carbon metabolites such as total and mono-glutamated folates, S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (see supplementary information accompanying this document). They're attached to this document as an example of the novelty and complexity of the methods adopted in this project, and the considerable effort required in their development and optimisation. Two manuscripts arising from this part of the project have been drafted for publication during 2017.

Milestone 6: Quantitative estimates of transcripts for key 1C genes have been completed in readiness for the bioinformatics analyses (Milestone 7). Quantification of further transcripts awaits initial outputs from these analyses. Current analyses working towards the identification of functional SNPs (Milestone 8), hopefully by the end of April 2017. Planning is underway to identify suitable animals for experimentation during the summer of 2017 (Milestones 9 to 11) for Objective 3. 
 

Work plan

? Original and revised sets of Milestones are included at the end of this document under 'Workplan'. Currently working with industry partners (AHDB Beef and Lamb, HCC and AgriSearch) to identify flocks that we can approach in order to screen and procure animals for Objective 3. 
? Have identified a feed company (Target Feeds, Shropshire) to manufacture our experimental diets using recipes implemented previously at Nottingham (Sinclair et al., 2007; Kanakkaparambil et al., 2009) in breeding ewes. Currently discussing the finer aspects of formulation, manufacture and delivery with the company. 
? Home Office Project Licence has been granted which gives us licenced authority to carry out the necessary experimental measurements in our animals.
? Working towards SNP analysis completion by end of April. 
? Experimental animals will be sourced from commercial farms during July/August 2017, for controlled nutritional studies up to October 2017.
? Final laboratory analyses conducted in October/November 2017.

This custom sheep SNP chip exploited knowledge of SNP loci in public databases (e.g. dbSNP, EVA) as well as new SNP variants discovered by re-sequencing DNA from Texel sheep. The bioinformatics analyses and SNP selection was undertaken by the University of Nottingham partner. The SNP chip was commissioned from Illumina Inc. The resulting custom sheep SNP chips were used by Edinburgh Genomics to genotype several hundred sheep DNA samples.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D4311A08-6BB7-4359-B61B-8C92CCD428DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The use of the custom sheep SNP chip was essential for genotyping sheep in order to identify putative associations between genetic variation in the target genes and variation in one-carbon metabolites.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a2b023f9f8.09832141</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Custom sheep SNP chip for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8928B686-100B-46C1-8FEE-DC5E7C27AE83</gtr:id><gtr:title>One-carbon metabolism and epigenetic regulation of embryo development.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Reproduction, fertility, and development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aab3549e3f140ccc891069fed2436660"><gtr:id>aab3549e3f140ccc891069fed2436660</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xu J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1031-3613</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e00d2a5e0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88F4578D-B593-4E1D-95A9-531D5E2209D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Epigenetic memory via concordant DNA methylation is inversely correlated to developmental potential of mammalian cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d7bdf6586af6137c4863d9464ac679ad"><gtr:id>d7bdf6586af6137c4863d9464ac679ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Choi M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1553-7390</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fce6dc99284.19907053</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C59606E4-10AF-4368-8939-C2B80E95F26B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Epigenetic memory via concordant DNA methylation is inversely correlated to developmental potential of mammalian cells</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d7bdf6586af6137c4863d9464ac679ad"><gtr:id>d7bdf6586af6137c4863d9464ac679ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Choi M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cb7319a70e58.23925349</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/K017810/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>21792584-97FF-4E36-9A3A-B992BE1DF6A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6EF57B2-8ACD-48E6-9B45-98507446B053</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigenetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FEBB49F4-3228-4CBC-98AB-99A078FB98B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Functional genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76F0E6B-0363-4D1F-9F5F-353AFD4E9DB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Livestock production</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>20FF6FDE-28DB-4D9D-99E6-8470C745EA60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transcriptomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
