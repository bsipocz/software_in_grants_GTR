Now, the audacious goal of contemporary cell biology is to understand how the billion proteins in a live cell allow them to move, multiply, contribute to a brain or defend us against viruses and bacteria. Imaging where and when proteins interact with each other has a major role to play at this frontier. Recent imaging of just a few types of proteins has already led to important new concepts in how immune cells communicate with each other and how they recognize signs of disease. High-resolution microscope images of immune cells contacting other cells have revealed temporary membrane structures, often called immune synapses, similar to the synapses that nerve cells make with one another for communication. Proteins commonly segregate into specific regions at the contacts between cells, and exploring how such changing arrangements of proteins occur and how they control immune cell communication is the new science opened up by the immune synapse concept. Over the last decade the use of antibodies has revolutionised the treatment of severe human diseases, such as non hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One way that these antibodies work is by triggering Natural Killer cells to directly kill diseased target cells. Crucially, nobody has yet determined what happens at immune synapses when antibodies trigger killing of diseased cells. Here, we plan to use state-of-the-art technologies to image immune synapses during antibody-medaited killing with a view to learning how to best optimise antibodies for this function. We will apply the understanding gained from these basic studies to the rational design of modified antibodies for optimal efficiency in a range of disease treatments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We aim to characterise the NK cell immune synapse (IS) during antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with a view to determining the key properties and regions on the target antigens or effector cells that promote optimal cell killing. Using antibodies and model systems developed at MedImmune, the effects of antibody affinity, receptor density and effector function will be used to determine the effects of antibody engineering on ADCC. Using state-of-the-art confocal microscopy within Prof D. Davis group (Imperial College), the spatial relationship and segregation of proteins at the submicrometer scale within the activating IS will be determined during ADCC and compared for the different antibodies and model systems developed by MedImmune. Specifically, we propose to:

1. Determine, for the first time, the supramolecular organisation of the NK cell IS during ADCC.
2. Determine how antibody affinity and ligand density relates to NK cell effector functions, including cytotoxicity and cytokine release, and how these correlate with changes within the supramolecular organisation of the IS.
3. Determine how the location of epitope and size of antibody relates to effector functions and the supramolecular organisation of the IS.

The overarching aim will then be to apply the understanding gained from these basic studies to the rational design of modified antibodies for optimal efficiency in ADCC.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>338675</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MedImmune</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Understanding and manipulating Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC) by human Natural Killer (NK) cells</gtr:description><gtr:id>56144DDD-3A07-4C7C-BB33-8BBAEC571FA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a new funded grant, work is just now beginning.

In August 2013, his popular-level book about the immune system entitled The Compatibility Gene was published by Penguin. The book received praise from Steven Pinker (Harvard), Steve Jones (UCL), Armand Leroi (Imperial) and Peter Doherty (Nobel Laureate), and had fantastic reviews, including in The Times, New York Times, Guardian, New Scientist, New Statesman, BBC Focus and Nature. It was picked by Bill Bryson in the Guardian's Books of the Year feature. An article about the book was also written by the popular journalist Tim Dowling, highlighted on the front cover of the Guardian (8th Sept 2013), and was discussed by comedian Russell Brand. The book and these articles also brought awareness to Anthony Nolan, the bone marrow transplantation charity. 
In 2013, Davis discussed the immune system and genetics with Bill Turnbull and Susannah Reid on BBC Breakfast TV, watched by over 1 million, and also on live US TV on The Circle, MSNBC. In 2013, Davis did over 15 radio interviews including several BBC radio stations, NPR California and Radio New Zealand. The Smithsonian Institute (USA) published a profile of Davis in 2013 and Nature magazine also profiled Davis in its feature on scientists who write books (Get the word out, Nature, 504, 177-179, 2013). 
In 2006, Davis published a major article - Secrets of the Immune Synapse - in Scientific American magazine, which has a worldwide readership of 1 million. In 2014, he published an article on the frontiers of immunology in BBC Focus magazine. He has been interviewed for features in New Scientist, The Guardian, The BMJ and various TV programs have solicited his advice. The BBC filmed an experiment performed in his laboratory for broadcast in 'The History of Transplantation', first shown on BBC FOUR, Sept 3rd 2008. He has given many interviews for international science magazines including in Spain, France and Portugal, on US Public Radio, and Australian radio. With Prof. Paul French (Physics, Imperial College), he presented his research at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in 2003. In 2000, he won the Oxford University Press Science Writing Prize. 
Davis has given numerous public lectures in immunology, including four at The Royal Institution. In 2008, Baroness Susan Greenfield commented in a letter that Davis's Friday Evening Discourse was 'really one of the most enjoyable in years'. Davis has presented his research at the Edinburgh, Manchester and Cheltenham Science Festivals, at Science Show Off events, on the Guardian science podcast, at a TED youth conference for ~500 6th formers, York's Festival of Ideas and at Latitude music festival (where he will return in 2017). Davis enjoys a close relationship with the Hay Festival where he has presented his own work as well as chaired and helping arrange many other science speakers (8 events in 2016), including Steve Jones, Jeremey Farrar and Martin Rees. Davis has written a second popular-level book about the immune system which will be published by Penguin Random House late 2017/early 2018.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589c552548c249.98090317</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2014,2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TV/Radio interviews</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A6B85B4-6635-48B5-9E1E-3F25AC03FB7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave multiple TV and radio interviews regarding my book The Compatibility Gene, including on BBC Breakfast TV, NBC in the USA, and many radio stations in the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and so on.
