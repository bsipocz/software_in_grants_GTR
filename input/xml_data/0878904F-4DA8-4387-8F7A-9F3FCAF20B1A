While this was a risk for both the original and the new series, the decision successfully created a radically new show, specifically aimed at the adult audiences who were increasingly being drawn to Buffy. In 2004, the Warner Brothers network decided not to renew the series and, despite a phenomenal protest by fans, the series ended (1999-2004). The end of the series, therefore, creates an ideal opportunity to reflect upon its five year run and the context of its production. In the light of recent discussions within academia about American Quality Television, Angel demonstrates how the commercial convention of the spin-off, designed to capitalise upon a successful formula, has been appropriated by the Mutant Enemy writing team to allow for an even more complex televisual experience that does not simply repeat the formula of Buffy the Vampire Slayer but imbues the series with its own distinct identity. The aim of this research project is to explore how the series Angel is a milestone in television due to the complexity of its narrative, genre, style and theme. In particular I will be exploring the series' place within a history of horror and fantasy television, as well as how the series has contributed to a modern vampire mythology. I will place the series within discussions of authorship, but rather than attribute credit to the series' producer Joss Whedon, I will examine the contribution of the Mutant Enemy writing team who worked collaboratively over five years to develop the series and push it towards increasingly challenging and transgressed limits. In so doing, I will examine their approach to narrative structure, creating a balance between the episodic and greater narrative arcs, while also addressing how the different influences and approaches of a range of different authors are brought together to create a narrative coherency. Finally, while Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been hailed as a feminist icon and a complex post-feminist text, I will explore how Angel reverses this focus by exploring issues of contemporary masculinity, a subject of increasing significance within both film and television studies. This research is being undertaken as part of a broader discourse within television studies, addressing contemporary developments within American Television as a cite for quality, experimentation and, in genre television in particular, transgression.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23005</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'I Don't Know What Kind of Man I Am Anymore': The Damaged Man in Angel and post Angel Cult TV</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF9C1784-25B7-4726-A9AB-D9EB1B090110</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A featured presentation on the role of masculinity in the cult television series Angel and the show's subsequent influence on other examples of Cult television, including Supernatural, Pushing Daisies, and Torchwood. The presentation was attended by over 60 delegates at the conference - which included academics, postgraduate students and members of the public and resulted in a dynamic discussion about the role of masculinity with in contemporary cult television.

This presentation was a contributing factor in my being invited to write a short piece on the television series Angel for the popular culture web journal PopMatters in 2011, for a special issue devoted to the works of Joss Whedon. This web issue has subsequently been expanded and published in hard copy by the commercial publisher Titan. Joss Whedon: The Complete Companion (London: Titan 2012). This paper formed a substantial portion of the chapter I contributed to both the online and print versions. This publication is aimed at a non-academic readership, thus expanding the impact of my research from an academic to a public forum.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7095989815.0488640b960cbe</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Cavemen vs Astronauts, Weapons to Be Determined: Angel, Spike and the Buddy Genre&quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78563B2A-1F3F-468F-AF1F-19133DEB8852</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A keynote paper exploring how the television series Angel draws upon conventions of the cinematic buddy genre in order to explore and challenge traditional representations of masculinity. This presentation lead to dynamic discussion about issues surrounding the representation and construction of masculinity both within the works of Joss Whedon and across cult television.

The discussion that resulted from this paper lead to an increasing interest and awareness of issues surrounding the representation of masculinity in the television series Angel. The audience openly reported that this presentation changed their views and opinions on the series. This fed into my writing of the chapter in my book on Angel for which I got the grant. The publication of this book has contributed to changing how people think about this television series and has fed into subsequent scholarship on Angel and Cult television, in relation to notions of masculinity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3033665207.2460070b890a32</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2007</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8CE749C4-EBF6-4BCC-9B50-3ECBF9A042F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Joss Whedon: The complete Companion</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/81baa9b22b7f8675c181f09f7782c4f9"><gtr:id>81baa9b22b7f8675c181f09f7782c4f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stacey Abbott</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780857689863</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545c912cd44235.34381237</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>95361809-EB15-4BDE-8650-8AAF6B2591F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Angel</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/319942566a4f35476fc74bdd68c6813f"><gtr:id>319942566a4f35476fc74bdd68c6813f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbott, Stacey</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-8143-3319-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_71604470423c040ce0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D500591/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46E85C19-DECF-4873-978B-4B57CA5EAC7B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Television HTC</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
