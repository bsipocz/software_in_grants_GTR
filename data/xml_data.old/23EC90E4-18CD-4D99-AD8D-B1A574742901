We can draw up a plan and manipulate materials to get most desired shapes and assemble those shapes into an object. However, this process is fundamentally different from how nature makes shapes, because nature grows things. A single cell can be multiplied, and its daughters altered in different ways, their subsequent growth rates and shapes changed, and those of their daughters, until a desired object is formed. Beyond even that, these shapes can be changed over time, responding to their environment and other cues, the ultimate smart-materials. We are only just beginning to understand the physical process of growth in plants, that is to say: what are the changes in the plant material that yield different shapes, and how are these changes regulated? To answer these questions, we will characterize a system involving a simple change in shape- the extension of a special organ, the hypocotyl, responsible for lifting the shoot tip out of the soil following germination.

When a seed is planted in the soil, the young plant must extend itself out into the light and air to begin photosynthesis. This extension happens in a deceptively simple way: between the shoot tip and the root tip of a young plant there is a special organ- the hypocotyl. The hypocotyl has a fixed number of cells which begin as roughly cubed shapes, but who eventually increase in length over 200x, becoming very elongated rectangles, or cuboids. This type of growth is called anisotropic, where one direction of expansion exceeds the other; here length increase is greater than width. The result of anisotropic growth in the hypocotyl is the extension of the shoot tip up and out of the soil, very rapidly. An added bonus to the system is its dynamic response to light and gravity.

What do we know about the control of cell growth direction in plants? A plant cell is basically a pressure filled box, where the pressure inside provides a non-directional force for growth and local changes in the wall provides the information about the direction of growth and hence any change in shape. The traditional view of anisotropic cell expansion, such as in the hypocotyl, is that each cell has a special organization in the wall, oriented cellulose fibers, that controls the direction of expansion. These fibers can be thought of as hoops around a barrel, limiting width expansion but capable of spreading apart to allow length increases. However, recent research points to a much more dynamic and complex picture. 

Within hypocotyl cells, cellulose orientation is more dynamic than previously thought- these are not just static hoops on barrels. In fact, true width-limiting orientations within the wall are only observed transiently after anisotropic expansion has begun, and even then not all the way around the cell surface, but only on their inner faces. Furthermore, another part of the cell wall, the pectin gel in which cellulose fibers are imbedded, is very important for regulating growth in plants.

In this project we will characterize the biophysical and chemical changes in cell wall properties associated with anisotropic cell growth, and test the idea that these changes are coordinated by the plant hormone, auxin.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The plant cell wall is the final regulator of plant cell shape, and by extension the form of the whole plant. Within this project we aim to further our understanding of the cell wall mechanics involved in the deceptively simple anisotropic cell expansion of dark-grown Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells. This system has many advantages. It has little cell division during its extension, it can respond to gravity and light cues, it is a relatively simple geometric cylinder, it has a fixed tissue organization, and the conversion from cube to cuboid is relatively straight forward.

The standing hypothesis about cell wall control of anisotropy lays control at the feet of cellulose fibril orientation within the wall, Paul Green's 'hoops on a barrel'. However, recent data indicate that this hypothesis is an oversimplification. There appears to be a role for other cell wall components such as hemicellulose and pectins in regulating hypocotyl extension. Our preliminary data indicate that cells in the epidermis display an elastic asymmetry in their cell walls coincident with anisotropic expansion: the radial walls decrease in rigidity while the end walls do not. This change is quickly reversible by light stimulus, and is sensitive to the integrity of cellulose and the cytoskeleton.

Capitalizing our successful development of Atomic Force Microscopy based nanoindentation, we will characterize hypocotyl cell wall elasticity during anisotropic growth in detail, combining the data with results from cell swelling assays. We will characterize the changes in cell wall thickness, cellulose orientations, and pectin chemistry. We will also investigate the potential regulatory role of pectins in the observed elastic asymmetry using immunocytochemistry and microarray analysis. Lastly, we will characterize the role of auxin transport in the regulation of elastic asymmetry and any observed differential cell wall chemistry.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project's fundamental aim is to understand the mechanics of cell shape generation. As a basic scientific question, the most immediate impacts will be felt by the academic scientific community: however, there are other impacts as well.
From a technological standpoint, the use of Atomic Force Microscopy as a nanoindenter is relatively new. As its development proceeds, the microscopy industry will benefit from interactions with researchers. These interactions will help to drive technology forward. Furthermore, the techniques developed could be highly useful to agricultural industry researchers and those working in private sector biofuels research. Lastly, this type of basic biological question is excellent for engaging public interest in science- the patterns and shapes in plants have been and will continue to be an excellent way to 'wow' children and adults alike.
In summary, we can foresee the following impacts from this project and our research:

1. Microscopy industry: by developing AFM based technologies in partnership with industry we can help to drive development.

The PI and post-doc will have semi-annual meetings with JPK (our AFM manufacturer) to exchange ideas about progress and developments in the technology. JPK has a strong history of collaboration with users for these purposes.

2. Agricultural Breeders: by understanding how plants gain their shapes our research may provide targets for future plant architecture breeding programs.

The Sainsbury Laboratory is part of the Cambridge Partnership for Plant Science (CPPS), which includes a wide range of breeding companies and local farmers groups (http://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/CPPS/members.html). The events organized by CPPS provide an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas with diverse stakeholders and we will attend at least one such event annually. 

3. Biofuels Industry: by understanding the physical role of cell wall polymers in plant shape, we can help tailor biofuels research targets away from alterations that could negatively impact plant growth.

Energy is the subject of a Strategic Research Initiative at Cambridge (http://www.energy.cam.ac.uk/), including a strong bioenergy component. We will participate in at least one annual event organized as part of the initiative to ensure that the project is networked into the bioenergy community.

4. The Public: this type of basic research is essential for engaging public interest and the principle of shape and pattern generation is an accessible and exciting topic for discussion in public lectures, radio programs, and classrooms.

The Sainsbury Laboratory has a very active public engagement program (http://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/outreach/outreach.html) with regular participation in science fairs, as well as school events for example associated with Science and Plants for Schools, who work from the Botanic Garden site. We will participate in at least two outreach events each year, in addition to helping to develop new resources with the Botanic Garden to reflect the work of the Sainsbury Laboratory in the Garden Exhibits. We also have an active area of development for increasing the profile of plant science research by creating podcasts and videocasts of science experiments.

5. Scientific community: the impacts of this project will be passed on to the scientific community through publication, presentations at meetings and conferences, and continued open dialogs with world-wide colleagues. 

The PI will attend two international meetings and one domestic meeting, and the post-doctoral researcher one domestic and one international meeting, over the duration of this project. We will also integrate ourselves into University of Cambridge initiatives such as the Cambridge Physical Biology Network. Due to the emerging nature of our field, we will also search out opportunities to write review articles, increasing the exposure of the field within traditional plant biology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>377556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95CDF9F9-DEA2-4773-A46C-D4A8A5349036</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Sainsbury Laboratory has a stall annually at the Cambridge Science Festival.

First- for a plant to grow up (as opposed to growing round and fat), special changes in the plant as a material need to take place. Interestingly, these changes occur in pectin which makes up a large part of the plant's material mass. The changes in pectin which we have observed allow the plant to grow at all and help it to grow upwards quickly- a key event in a young plant's life that helps it get out of the soil and begin photosynthesis.
Second- we have uncovered some interesting links between the biochemical changes in pectin we observe and the material properties of pectin gels. In this case, we can change the elasticity and viscosity (flow) fo the gels by changing their chemistry. We are exploring how this might be used in food science and medicine.
Thirdly- we have discovered that the young plant can sense how much food it has stored inside itself, and that is uses this to determine how quickly it will grow out of the soil. If the pant has more sugarm it is less of a hurry to get out and start photosynthesising so it changes the balance of its growth direction. If it has only a little sugar it grows more upwards, increasing the speed of emergence from the soil. We are exploring this further now.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are hopeful that our plant growth data will be used by other researchers as a springboard for further understanding.
It may also be used by farmers to help optimise early seedling emergence from the soil.

We are currently working with the Veterinary School to investigate using our materials in medical applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>06600E34-5C72-406E-8629-A67C6A0146F1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b0fa39461600.71469479</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
