Comprising disparate sub-sectors from arts, media, design and software, numerous reports and studies have attended to the importance of the UK in defining and measuring the cultural and creative economy. For instance, the DCMS Culture White Paper (March 2016, 15) identified that the sector contributes to multiple values: Intrinsic (enriching value of culture in and of itself); Social (educational and well-being); and Economic (contribution to growth and job creation). While
international studies have been undertaken on inequalities in creative labour, foregrounding unevenness around access and networking, division of labour, and status and promotion, there has been a lack of analysis on issues surrounding the roles and experiences of minority faith groups, along with their engagement and leadership within distinctive sub-sectors. Further, despite significant empirical analysis of gender and class in creative labour, these have not considered in detail the interplay and relevance of faith and religion in the sector.

Accordingly, the Fellowship will be used to develop a research project on the role of minority faith actors in creative labour. It will focus specifically on Muslim women, whom have been the subjects of numerous recent reports and policy initiatives intended to support belonging and integration. Addressing their roles in the fast-growing Muslim marketplace of digital media and fashion, along with artistic roles in the transitioning remits of art galleries, this project advances these discourses and debates by focusing for the first time on forms of cultural engagement. The sub-sectors profiled offer a range that is representative of the scope and complexity of the sector, comprising emerging forms with low barriers to entry (digital media) to more traditional cultural institutions with high barriers to entry (art galleries); and those that intersect everyday to event culture (e.g fashion; art galleries).

Ultimately the project will lead to a book (provisionally entitled 'Faith, Creativity, Work: Muslim women and the UK Cultural and Creative Economy) and two journal articles, exhibition and launch event, and a cross-sectoral research and knowledge exchange network. It will provide a framework on Muslim women producers advancing two central themes: first, Muslim women are already contributing to the UK cultural and creative economy in important ways; second, developing faith specific support for women may nevertheless be needed because of distinctive barriers to entry and pressures in working in flexible creative labour, in spaces that are typically secular and dominated by white male leadership.

My work during the Fellowship will answer the following questions:- How is the social category 'Muslim women' being mobilised by creative producers within their work and in the wider cultural and creative economy? -What different roles and practices in creative labour are currently being performed by Muslim women in each of the sub-sectors? -What are the particular social and spatial issues surrounding pathways into and advancement for Muslim women in each of the sub-sectors? Does an analysis of social and spatial issues surrounding pathways and advancement present a case for faith specific support? - What kinds of support including policy mechanisms, institutional reforms, and agents are required to pursue diversification of the cultural and creative sector for Muslim women?

The Fellowship will be very important for developing my leadership skills. It will consolidate my experience of knowledge exchange and public engagement, with the aim of strengthening the skills necessary to achieve substantial and clear impacts on policy, and will lead to the development of new cross-sectoral network on diversifying cultural and creative labour.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given that the research is cross-sectoral, bridging policy, cultural and education sectors, non-academic beneficiaries are central to its aims and objectives:

1) Art Galleries and Museums: The Whitworth are a major stakeholder in the research with aims to develop its educational and curatorial programme and continue to diversify to reflect the city in which it is situated. Building upon an existing relationship with the PI, the project will significantly develop its understanding of barriers to engaging with Muslim women and their networks. This is important to ensure The Whitworth's relevance and longevity given that all Arts Council England Portfolio organisations will need to demonstrate commitment to diversity in the future. The findings will also be shared with Manchester Museum as they develop their new South Asian Gallery, and associated educational programme (launch 2020), and 10 Bridge organisations responsible for access to cultural education for young people across the UK.

2) Schools and minority young people: Drawing upon existing contacts from The Whitworth, whose education team is already working with local schools, the project RA (artist-researcher) will deliver interactive workshops on employment pathways and apprenticeship opportunities in the cultural and creative economy. Schools and minority students will benefit from knowledge exchange on these opportunities, and will also be able to shape ideas on future strategies for resisting faith-based inequalities in the sector by supporting the production of a Manchester action plan. Using future grants and networks developed during this project, the plan with be tested in different metropolitan areas and potentially scaled up.

3) Muslim Women: who work or aim to work in the cultural and creative economy are the main focus of the project. Some of the highest social and economic exclusion in the UK is experienced by Muslim women, which is accentuated by negative media scrutiny emphasising victimhood and subjugation. Rarely have the contributions of Muslim women to culture, the economy and to activism been highlighted. The short films, action-plan and exhibition will allow for multiple communication channels that will reach a range of audiences beyond their typical users. This will develop profiles and contacts in research and policy networks, and could potentially develop a broader marketplace for their work.

4) Manchester City Council, Government departments and skills councils: Manchester City Council are the primary local authority that the findings of the research and action-plan will be shared with. Loss of capacity due to a series of budget cuts means that the project can deliver research the council is unable to lead, addressing inequalities and supporting diversity in the cultural and creative sectors; one of the major growth areas of the city's economy. Multiple central government departments and skills councils will be interested in the findings that inform cross-cutting future strategies for
diversifying culture and the arts, with attention to faith e.g Creative and Cultural Skills and National Skills Academy for Creative and Cultural Council; Department of Culture, Media and Sport. More specifically, recommendations for Arts Council England will inform the development of their apprenticeship scheme as part of 'Cultural citizen' initiative. This builds upon an invited contribution for a recently published report on Engagement and integration of Muslims in British society by Citizens UK.

5)The wider public: Will benefit from research that advances understanding on the crucial contribution made to British society by Muslim women in culture and the economy, adding important new evidence to inform debate on Islam, gender and integration. The public will benefit from an exhibition and free evening event at The Whitworth (usual attendance c.800 people), and access to short films on the project website from leading artists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173577</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P014828/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CB391BE-87E7-4006-A2C5-43ED9DBA773C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural and Anthrop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
