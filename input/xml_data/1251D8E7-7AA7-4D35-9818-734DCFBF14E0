Blood stem cells are found in the bone marrow and these cells can divide and specialise to form mature blood cells including white cells (to fight infection) red cells (to deliver oxygen) and cells called platelets which enable the blood to clot in response to injury. Patients with acquired abnormalities of the blood become ill because they no longer form these mature cells from stem cells. In the most severe forms of blood disease (such as leukaemia) the stem cells become cancerous, grow abnormally and fail to form mature blood cells. Consequently patients develop anaemia, they bleed and are prone to infection. In some cases the only cure for such diseases is to kill off the diseased bone marrow stem cells and replace them with new stem cells from a donor (so called bone marrow transplantation or HSCT). This procedure, introduced in the 1970s, can cure many patients with leukaemia. A major problem in clinical practice is finding the appropriate stem cells that will not be rejected by the patient and equally will not attack the patients normal tissues. In my work I am investigating a new source of stem cells found in the umbilical cord of normal newborn babies. Normally these cells are discarded with the placenta after birth. We are now establishing how these cord blood cells may best be used to provide stem cells for transplantation of children and adults with severe blood diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The MHU programmes are ultimately working towards improving the diagnosis and/or treatment of haematological diseases thereby improving public health. Work on the transcriptional and epigenetic programmes underlying commitment, lineage specification and differentiation within normal haematopoiesis will inevitably inform studies to expand and manipulate haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. An important aim will then be to translate this into clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) practice which to date, provides the only example of routine clinical application of stem cell therapy. Understanding how individual, key transcriptional regulators such as Runx1, SCL, LMO2, Tel, GATA2 and GATA1, Pu.1, C/EBPa cytokine signalling pathways and chromatin modifying enzymes such as MLL1 influence cell fate decisions is important for understanding how such regulators control normal haematopoiesis and how, when mutated, they contribute to the abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation associated with haematological malignancy. This will be complemented by examining the impact of leukaemic fusions on the transcriptional networks of blood cells in mouse and the embryonic zebrafish aiming to elucidate the mechanisms by which commonly identified fusions initiate leukaemogenesis. 
The MHU also has significant programmes that have made high profile contributions to identifying and fully characterising pre-leukaemic and leukaemic stem cells (LSC) in primary human samples. LSC are important because they are postulated to be a key cellular source of relapse. If this is shown to be the case, failure to eradicate LSC is likely to provide an early cellular marker of treatment failure and provide novel opportunities to develop LSC-targeted therapy that would improve clinical outcomes. These programmes have brought together international and UK clinical collaborators working within respected clinical trial group structures that will facilitate transfer of work from these programmes into clinical practice. My own work on HSCT is being developed in collaboration with the MHU and will intersect with all of these programmes in the MRC MHU</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12009/12</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>939798CA-B6AE-4C12-9DCC-A0F88F84E6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Blood</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1A41A859-2076-46E6-B80F-CE4E1E8EDC1D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.5  Resources and infrastructure (underpinning)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93C4699B-9E5C-4982-9CCC-EFD5B9712D6E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.6  Resources and infrastructure (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
