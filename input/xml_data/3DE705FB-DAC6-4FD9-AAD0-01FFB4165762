Encoding</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N00194X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The practices of creating, sharing and listening to music are changing. New digital media recast age-old technologies and introduce new avenues of musical expression. This project uses the novel concept of 'sonic writing' to encompass the making of musical instruments, the design of symbolic musical notation and the invention and use of sound recording technologies. Under the rubric of 'sonic writing' the research will undertake the first media theoretical investigation into how new musical media can be genealogically traced from historical inscription practices. Such a wide-ranging approach to the analysis of musical media has not been developed until now.

The project engages with the current pivotal moment in the music industry where a complete rethinking of established work practices and economic models is required. New instruments, notational techniques and media player technologies are emerging, representing an uncertain and fleeting technological situation where novelty and experimentation can be perceived to override concerns of sustainability and tradition. Whilst this transformation can be exciting, serious concerns are expressed by practitioners regarding the longevity and critical understanding of new musical work. This project will outline a clear vision and future direction for composers, performers and the wider industry in terms of compositional approach and technology design.

The primary output of this research is a monograph to be published by Bloomsbury in the Sound Studies series. A detailed programme of events underpins the research for the book, designed to establish a new research agenda in music technology research, as well as providing the PI with a significant opportunity to develop and exercise leadership skills in the research field. The two-year research programme is split into four work packages, which map to the research and writing of respective chapters in the book:

WP1 - Materialised Theories: Design Concepts in Musical Instruments
WP2 - Abstracting Sound: Symbols and Process in Musical Notation
WP3 - Encoding Sound: Phonography and Machine Listening
WP4 - New Musical Media: Writing Music with Algorithms

Each work package is undertaken through a partnership with a leading international research institution, investigating a bespoke area of sonic writing where key activities provide the basis for research methods, knowledge exchange and dissemination. These include:
 
- a residency
- a symposium
- two workshops
- archival research
- international conference
- extensive literature review

The project will map new developments and clarify an increasingly complex media landscape. By building up a strong online presence - through a website, mailing list and social media - the project enables interested parties to participate in a dialogue and partake in well-documented activities and outputs. The project establishes a collaborative and open approach that invites people from diverse fields, from leading researchers or industry people to music software users or listeners, to discuss research and development in this rapidly changing field.

For over 15 years, the PI has had an impactful career in developing free and open source musical software, publishing results widely in academic journals and conferences. He is the co-founder of the ixi-audio project, well known in the world of electronic music for its series of open source music software and knowledge exchange workshops in interactive sound programming. Building upon a strong network of academic partners and software users, this project will shape a new collaborative research agenda in the area of sonic writing, impacting on new music research and the future of sonic media. In alignment with the PI's past dissemination practices, this project will benefit other researchers, professionals in the music industry, aspiring younger musicians and the musically interested public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project will provide a clear understanding of how digital media transform traditional sonic writing practices in the areas of instrument making, notation and recording. The project directly responds to wide concerns of reproducibility and sustainability, as well as cultural memory and tradition. How is new music to be written with concerns of longevity? How can all cultural traditions be supported by new music technology? The danger with the digital transformation, where we reduce objects and practices of the physical world into abstract concepts in the digital domain, is the loss of tacit knowledge and cultural traditions. The project will launch a programme of knowledge exchange activities (see Pathways to Impact) designed to establish routes to impact by engaging with the following groups:

* Practitioners

Composers and performers will gain a clear understanding of the problems involved in designing and writing for new and future instruments. The project explores how musical works can be notated such that they can be ported to new platforms and re-interpreted in future technological contexts, as well as preserved and archived. 

The research will map out instrumental ergonomics and design patterns that are transformed into new digital applications. By addressing cultural practices and the need for global traditions to be represented in new digital technologies, the project will be relevant for musicians at a global scale, provide guidance on open source approaches to hardware and software design, documentation and knowledge exchange.

Practitioners within all musical genres will, through the monograph and online media, have a joint resource and reference when engaging in the composition and interpretation of new musical scores. They will benefit from a historical view tracing evolution from early musical scores to current techniques such as animated, interactive and generative notations.

* Media and Industry

Journalists, critics, developers and manufacturers of new music technologies will benefit from the clear analysis and mapping of past, current and future practices in sonic writing. In the longer term, this will inform approaches concerning the representation of new instruments, compositional systems or file formats by manufacturers, online traders, galleries and museums.

Musicologists, journalists, critics and other writers on music will benefit from the taxonomical work defining this new field. The research will establish a much-needed common language for describing the work of composers, performers, technologists and instrument makers. New concepts in machine listening, computational creativity and interactivity will be outlined within this scope.

The project will have a longer-term impact on business models and policy for software houses and open source culture by presenting novel ways of creating and disseminating musical content. We currently lack commercial categories for diverse digital media content (for example, there is no 'generative music' category on the iTunes store).

* The Broader Public and Cultural Organisations 

Cultural organisations, institutions, music venues and festivals will be able to engage more easily with a fast changing terrain in terms of how they define and specify resources, equipment and performance requirements. They will gain tools to analyse public interest in work of this kind. 

Museums, galleries, libraries and other archives will acquire a better understanding of archival methods and priorities relevant for new media works. The problem of cultural memory in music technologies will be raised and investigated.

This research project will establish a unique platform where composers, performers, instrument makers, technologists and archivists come together for discussion, experimentation and collaboration on topics at the heart of the debate: issues of technology, composition, performance, making, coding, sharing and collaborating.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>190267</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This club event was organised by a local Brighton organiser.

The workshop explored the way we write with particular focus on sound. Abstract poetry like sound-poetry or after-language poetry, textual musical notation, algorithmic notation, secondary musical notation, sound poetry, concrete poetry, and graphic notation are all forms of writing that we will engage with during the workshop. We made musical instruments, considering how their design is a process of writing. The workshop was highly interdisciplinary - with participants from institutions of divergent practices - and we considered approaches in thinking about writing sound, about composing instruments, writing algorithms, speaking notes, drawing sound.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6853bdf0f43.54548951</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lydgalleriet.no/?p=1744</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DiDIY Maker Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9FCDBA3E-065C-496D-B7F4-8315C86F76BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organised a DiDIY Maker Workshop at the University of Sussex.

The Threnoscope is notated through live coding, with sounds represented on a large projected graphical score. Its visual appearance illustrates the harmonics of a fundamental tone, as well as speaker locations, and musical notes move around the spectral and physical space, long in duration, and sculptable by the performer.

For Borealis, the drones of the Threnoscope were combined with a reading of the V&amp;ouml;lusp&amp;aacute; - an Old Norse poem from the Poetic Edda, an anonymous collection that underpins Nordic heritage that is performed in a style that falls somewhere between reading and singing.

AlgoMech celebrates a resurgence of making in performance, where creative processes are made visible during a live event. Rather than presenting technology as seamless, we pick at the seams, exposing its innards as human-made and reconfigurable. We will also go beyond fashionable notions of technology to take the long view; bringing together mechanical, kinetic, electronic, and software arts, from periods spanning the stone age to present day, building a picture of the human maker as both digital and analogue, thinking and feeling, embodied yet reaching beyond what is bodily possible. The festival will take place across Sheffield, and will include concerts, talks, hands-on workshops, and a club night.

The arts research symposium focused on the latest developments in this field, drawing on both academic and artistic perspectives. We invited proposals for artist talks and academic papers in the form of short abstracts, describing the theme and structure of the research presentation or the artist talk. As an inclusive, cross-disciplinary symposium, we were open-minded about the form of the talk and proposal.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c67ffd6f73f5.73065373</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://miptl.org/site/musical-instruments/arts-research-symposium-at-the-algomech-festival-call-for-proposals/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interagency in Technologically Mediated Performance</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31F17676-E49B-4CD5-A0D7-B21465752700</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In this talk, Thor Magnusson discussed the concept of music technology, aiming to redefine it as something we do, as opposed to something we consume.

The 10th Orpheus Research Seminar offered the opportunity for contributors from around the world to gather and explore the theme of composition as critical technical practice.

This seminar - convened by Jonathan Impett - considered composition as a research activity - a process informed by theory and intuition, constraint and contingency, expectation and experience. It is a continuous iterative process of inscription and reflection in which its models, metaphors, aspirations, obligations, tools and technologies all play a part. This process is distributed temporally, socially and materially. The artefacts of composition - however notated, improvised, virtual, embodied or technologically implemented - are hybrid technical objects. Neither pure 'inspiration' not unmediated formalism account for what they contribute. We might rather consider composition as a design process, and study its dynamics and decisions in the spirit of critical technical practice - a term coined by Philip Agre in his work on the creation of the artefacts of artificial intelligence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c680909b11b3.33208150</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.orpheusinstituut.be/en/events/sound-work-composition-as-critical-technical-practice</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Conference on Live Interfaces</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A20240C-AEB4-4948-81FF-3FC3A741C94B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 3rd International Conference on Live Interfaces was held at the University of Sussex's Attenborough Centre between June 28th - July 3rd.

The conference took take place at the University of Sussex in June, 2016. This biennial conference brought together people working with live interfaces in the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, dance, puppetry, robotics or games. The conference scope was highly interdisciplinary but with a focus on interface technologies of expression in the area of performance. Topics of liveness, immediacy, presence (and tele-presence), mediation, collaboration and timing or flow were engaged with and questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role contemporary media technologies play in human expression.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c67c3e4f6432.14637086</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.liveinterfaces.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New Notations Symposium at IRCAM, Paris</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>853B6C9B-D206-4EFF-AD27-DE6C5CAF7667</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The New Notations Symposium at IRCAM explored current notational practices in the writing for new instruments and media. The aim was to study the changes in notational strategies that are brought forward with new music technologies, where graphics, animation, and algorithmic techniques offer extended compositional possibilities. Musical notation and instruments evolve in parallel, and we find that in much contemporary work, the notation system becomes part of the instrument, or even an integral part of the musical piece itself. Processor-based media enable dynamic score systems that are applied to generate musical events in real-time or respond to instrumental performances in ways traditional media are not capable of.

Furthermore, with the increased analytical power gained with machine listening technologies, we find that auxillary notations of timbre, gesture, and affect become important aspects of the &amp;quot;writing&amp;quot; of a musical work. Contemporary composers study this potential of new notation, and this symposium looks into the design of new instruments from ergonomic and timbral perspectives and studies how musical notation develops in concert with these changes.

Symposium topics included musical notation for new instruments, secondary notation, graphic or algorithmic notation, live and animated notation, usability, sustainability and legacy, tradition, issues of learning, audience communication, and more. The symposium consisted of presentations, performances, and discussions. It was an open event involving the Parisian public, practitioners, and an invited group of international researchers.

The symposium took place over two days, where the first day was presentations, performances and discussions. The second day consisted of workshops and discussions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c67e256ea133.91808505</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sonicwriting.org/ircam.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Expert panel on Machine Creativity at the IASPM conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C9F0392-2F2E-43F9-8B47-033C2E05FE6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Thor Magnusson chaired a roundtable on machine creativity at the IASPM conference held at the University of Sussex in September, 2016.

Online tutorials have been published, workshops have been held, and the research team has been active in presenting work at conferences and symposia. The Sonic Writing project has organised a few key events in this first year of activity:

- Musical Organics Symposum and Workshop at STEIM, Amsterdam (impact report: http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~thm21/sonicwriting/MusicalOrganicsImpact.pdf)
- New Notations Symposium and Workshop at IRCAM, Paris 
- The 3rd International Conference on Live Interfaces, Sussex, Brighton (impact report: http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~thm21/sonicwriting/ICLIImpactReport.pdf) 
- Arts Research Seminar at the Festival of Algorithmic and Mechanical Movement, Sheffield

These four events have focussed on diverse research questions integral to the Sonic Writing project. Questions of technological agency in instrument design, changes of notation with digital technologies, of technology as prosthesis, and the role of algorithmic notation in artistic work have been the key questions studied in the respective events.

At all of the above events, people report that networks have been formed, research collaborations, artistic collaborations, and invites.
