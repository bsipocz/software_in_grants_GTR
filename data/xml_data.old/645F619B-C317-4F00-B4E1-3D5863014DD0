The best way to describe it is as an astronomy-documentary-meets-electronic-music-concert and it will be performed at science, music, and art festivals across the UK and internationally. Alongside the main event, several workshops will be organised, centred around the science and aimed at schoolchildren, where the children will be able to speak with the scientists to learn about astronomy.

For the audio-visual performance, bespoke music tracks have been produced, inspired and guided by the contents of the talks. To supplement them, visualisations will now be created that will be projected on special screens during the performance and will enhance the immersive, and interactive aspects of the event. These visualisations will be created from real astronomical data from experiments like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Survey, as well as from computer simulations of supernova explosion, growth of the cosmic web etc. Furthermore, some of the concepts described in talks, for example the cosmic inflation at the birth of our universe, or the creation of ordinary matter when inflation ends are very difficult to visualise for the public and not many scientifically correct videos of them exist in the public domain. Such videos will be created as a part of this project and after the initial year of performances, they will be released under the Creative Commons Licence into the public domain.

The Entropy team started working together in 2011, when they first formed under a working title of 'Neutrino'. They consisted of: Zazralt Magic now at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, whose expertise lie in the field of stellar astrophysics, Katarina Markovic now at the Institute for Cosmology and Gravitation in Portsmouth, who is a cosmologist, and Dopplereffekt, from Munich, Germany, who are a renown electronic music duo, whose compositions have always been inspired by science and technology. Later, the team was joined by Antivj from Brussels, Belgium, who are a cutting-edge visual arts studio and will create the visuals as well as the stage set-up.

This project presents science to the public in an entirely new format that will appeal to science, music and art fans alike. We expect to reach several thousand people in the first year just with the live performance. Online we count on tens of thousands of views of the material we release and expect that it will be used by many scientists and outreach officers in their public engagement activities in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Entropy was performed twice in September 2016 at the TodaysArt festival in The Hague. The performance featured the talk about Cosmology, explaining the birth of the universe, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and the future predicted end of times (among other astronomy topics). The talk was accompanied by live and pre-recorded music by the electronic music duo called Dopplereffekt, who had composed their pieces specifically for this project and that were not released elsewhere. The entire performance was immersive, largely due to the double screen projection of visualisations of simulations of scientific concepts and real astronomical data from the SDSS and DES surveys.</gtr:description><gtr:id>545C0A0E-1B4F-47D9-BF33-A09E3876C10D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An audience of approximately 750 art festival attendees was reached.

Here is a public website containing a video summary of the TodaysArt festival where they featured the Entropy premieres:

The Entropy clip starts at about 1:40 until about 2:10.

There were several Tweets about this performance: https://twitter.com/entropyspace.

A review was posted on ResidentAdvisor:
&amp;quot;Dopplereffekt managed to keep their audience engaged during a lecture on a topic that could easily have been too much for a Saturday evening: the Big Bang. Stardust, blobs and Milky Ways were projected onto a huge screen that dwarfed the speaker-cosmologist Dr. Dida Markovic-creating a starry universe all around her. While Markovic spoke, Dopplereffekt founder Gerald Donald (AKA Heinrich Mueller) manipulated a soundboard and various synths, at first to minimal effect. But as stardust collapsed into planets, the music started bubbling with energy. On its own the score wasn't that thrilling, but combined with telescopic images, it had the audience enthralled.&amp;quot;
(Dopplereffekt is the band.)
