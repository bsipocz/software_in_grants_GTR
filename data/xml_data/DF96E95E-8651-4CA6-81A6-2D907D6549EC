This project aims to understand how this can be so.\n\nPerhaps the single most obvious example of a place-based religious practice is pilgrimage. Eg Orthodox pilgrims gather yearly at the Holy Sepulchre Church in Jerusalem, for the ceremony of the Sacred Fire -- when a taper is said to light miraculously, so confirming the resurrection of Christ. Other pilgrims have found such practices superstitious, and have withdrawn from the established 'holy sites', seeking landscapes and other places that have retained their appearance from Jesus's time. For these pilgrims, a visit to the Holy Land serves as an aid to thought, helping the believer to imagine various biblical scenes more vividly.\n\nIt might be thought that the first of these practices depends for its sense upon contentious metaphysical claims -- concerning eg the occurrence of natural law suspending events. The second practice by contrast adopts a 'psychologising' stance -- seeing the point of pilgrimage as relative to the difference it makes to thought. In so far as they concentrate on what happens metaphysically or psychologically, these views both seem to overlook in some degree the physicality of at least some pilgrimage practices: they do not give a full enough account of why pilgrims should find it important to place themselves in physical proximity to certain artefacts or places.\n\nI shall develop an account of pilgrimage practice which attends more closely to this dimension of the practice. I shall do this in two ways. First of all, I shall explore various other cases where the relationship of physical proximity seems to count for something in its own right. For instance, it is commonly agreed that the history of a site such as 'Ground Zero' sets a constraint on how the site is to be treated in the present -- it means for example that certain uses of the site in the present are inappropriate. So in this sort of case we can be confronted with an ethical demand by virtue of our physical location at a site, and this provides I shall argue one model for the significance of pilgrimage. My second model will draw on discussions of how we succeed in referring to things in non-religious contexts. Eg it is commonly supposed that the ability of earlier and later generations of scientists to refer to the same theoretical entity (eg an atom) depends not so much on the fact that they have a shared account of the entity (most likely their accounts will conflict) -- it depends rather on their shared 'material practices', that is, upon how they manipulate or otherwise engage with relevant bits of the material world. We can understand the behaviour of pilgrims in analogous terms I shall argue -- by thinking of their practices as having a reference-securing role.\n\nIt is commonly supposed in theology and in popular religious belief that God is not so much another individual entity but rather a context in the light of which we can discern the significance of individual things. In this respect relationship to God proves to be like our relationship to places. Recent philosophical work on the nature of place suggests various ways of deepening this analogy -- eg by considering how human behaviour can fit, or fail to fit, the context provided by a place, and how human identity is rooted in place. On this basis, I shall argue that knowledge of place contributes to knowledge of God, as the ultimate 'place' within which our lives are set. These reflections will provide a third account of how relationship to place can be religiously important.\n\nFinally, I shall test the fruitfulness of these models, by showing how they illuminate the religious significance of particular buildings and landscapes. Overall, the project will help to re-conceptualise the idea of divine presence, and the embodied, &amp;quot;placed&amp;quot;character of religious knowledge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26289</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F004559/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B726621-12A9-419F-B798-630155FB0A8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
