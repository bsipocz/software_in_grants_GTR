Three key developments form the focus for this project: the arrival of 'gene-editing' whose goal is to understand and remove disease-related mutations, the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells that can be controlled to create different types of tissue for cell therapy, and the emergence of 3D printing of biological material which aims to create novel structures for bodily repair and renewal. 

These developments can all be described as 'biomodifying technologies', that is, those that modify living biological tissue in novel and increasingly patient-orientated and customised ways. These are not simply important in a biomedical sense but also in the ways in which they are reshaping the landscape of biomedical innovation in the 21st century. Not only do these technologies challenge existing governance frameworks in terms of standards for safety, quality control, and traceability of biological materials, equally and perhaps more importantly, they raise new questions for health systems and social science inasmuch as these are 'gateway' technologies with wide-ranging applications, significant commercial engagement and high levels of transferability, which open up far-reaching possibilities. We need to understand and anticipate such developments if we are to build an informed and constructively critical social science of biomedical innovation today. More broadly, this contributes towards the ESRC's core priority and delivery plan aim of supporting research that can promote economic growth and development, and to do so in a way that is based on robust, engaged social science that maps and analyses the implications of innovation.

The project will contribute towards STS theory through the development of a conceptual framework for the analysis of 'experimental space', a framework built through the analysis of the spatial characteristics of the science of biomodifying technologies, the processes of valuation at work in these spaces, and the regulatory and governance landscape of the field. The first element focuses on the sites at which biomodifying technologies are developed, the geographical networks through which they are mobilised, and, the knowledge-based terrain they define, through which biomedical scientists build new models, standards, trials and clinical applications. The second element draws on recent social science work on the meaning of value - sometimes called 'valuation studies'. Here we are interested in discovering how values and benefits are defined, by whom, and according to what criteria. Our third element draws on social science work on regulation and governance, in particular, work that explores the tensions between regulation, law, and new biologies. Together these approaches help us to build and analyse datasets that will allow us to understand the current and future impact of the three technologies in the hospital, the clinic, the firm and the wider implications they will have for the health system.

The project will use a mixed methods approach for UK fieldwork combining documentary analysis of various literatures, including the academic and grey literatures, with qualitative semi-structured interviews with a range of key stakeholders in each of the fields being studied. These include scientists working in academic laboratories, representatives of SMEs, patient groups, research agencies, regulators, and senior staff in important service organisations (e.g. biobanks). Secondary data from other European, US and East Asian sources will also be secured.The project will result in data, academic papers and policy reports that will offer the first comprehensive social science analysis of these major developments in biomedicine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's research findings will benefit the following groups: innovators and industry, policymakers and regulators, healthcare professionals and managers, patients and publics. Details of each group and how they will benefit are provided below:

Impact on innovators and industry - beneficiaries include non-academic researchers, technology developers and firms (Small / Medium Enterprises and large companies) with an interest in developing, translating and commercialising biomodifying technologies and products and services derived from them. Research findings will have impact by i) informing early stage development of new biomodifying technologies by providing insight into the needs and valuation practices of a variety of stakeholders including patients, regulators, and health service professionals ii) helping to shape viable business models for deploying biomodifying products in the healthcare marketplace. The mapping of the experimental and regulatory landscape will also provide valuable guidance on the legal and ethical requirements and responsibilities of service providers. Several project members are members of the UK Association for Studies in Innovation Science and Technology (AsSIST-UK) which has been set up with the goal of supporting social sciences engagement with science and innovation, civil society, government, and industry within the UK and globally, and is particularly well-suited to facilitating impact of the kind envisioned for this project. 

Impact on policy and regulation - beneficiaries will include agencies and regulatory actors responsible for the governance of biomodifying technologies and policy makers promoting the social and economic benefits of innovative medical technologies. Research findings will have an impact by i) providing an evidence-base on the social, regulatory and organisational implications of current research trajectories and translational pathways for biomodifying technologies, ii) identifying what kinds of evidence are being required and what types of valuation practices are applicable for different applications of biomodifying technologies, and iii) highlighting significant dimensions of the experimental space for the three cases studies to inform policy and regulatory decision-making for emerging products and services.

Impact on healthcare professionals and managers - Healthcare professionals and NHS managers will benefit from having a robust empirically informed overview of the experimental space of biomodifying technologies that will allow them to identify prospective applications and the translational and regulatory landscape in which these research trajectories are embedded. This is pertinent for the future uptake of innovative biomodifying technology products and services and where healthcare professionals and managers will play a key role in translating biomodifying technologies from the experimental space to clinical adoption. Healthcare professionals and NHS managers will also benefit from the inclusion of NHS representatives in the expert workshops and data generation phases of the project. 

Impact on patients and publics - beneficiaries include patients, charities and patient interest organisations, and various publics. Patients and patient organisations will benefit from the opportunity to have their needs and perspectives on the value of different biomodifying technologies, their associated translational pathways, and the types of evidence and valuation at stake solicited as part of the project's empirical data collection and used to inform the project outputs and findings. We have excellent links with the MHRA's Patient Forum which will provide an important vehicle for this. There will also be opportunities to participate in expert workshops and take part in upstream engagement with other key stakeholder groups. Findings will also have an impact by informing and encouraging participation in public debates on innovative biomodifying technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>610772</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>78BC71FE-1877-4C69-88E1-273A8DE39D9F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The European General Data Protection Regulation: challenges and considerations for iPSC researchers and biobanks.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Regenerative medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2998003feda254368f8b89eaa1b983dd"><gtr:id>2998003feda254368f8b89eaa1b983dd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morrison M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1746-0751</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a82cf2c4ca072.55310039</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2F5A3A0C-468D-446A-BEC6-5DE325D4D92F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Key challenges in bringing CRISPR-mediated somatic cell therapy into the clinic.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genome medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c920874356ad9fdf19475693c8d2a7b3"><gtr:id>c920874356ad9fdf19475693c8d2a7b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nicol D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1756-994X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a82cf2c07b6e7.09407366</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002943/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
