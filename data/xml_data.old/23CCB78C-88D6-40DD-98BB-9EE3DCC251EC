spectacle</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P01481X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed Network's central theme is to examine the role of architectural models within the creative process, consider ways in which architectural models can engage public audiences with key architectural and design issues, and explore how digital technologies for 3D modelling and imaging can be utilised in their display and interpretation. The Network will focus on the western tradition, from the early modern period to the contemporary. It will form the first phase of a major project to design and build a virtual museum of architectural models.

In partnership with the Architectural Association (AA), RIBA, and the Sir John Soane's Museum, the Architekturmuseum, Technische Universit&amp;auml;t Munich, the MAP Laboratory, CNRS and Sorbonne, this network will connect users, ideas and objects in order to promote and support the use of models in academic research and public display. It will bring together experts on architectural models; identify resources on architectural models; and share experience of interpreting architectural models for non-expert audiences. In so doing, it will facilitate knowledge transfer, identify knowledge gaps, and lay the groundwork for future collaborations. The network will increase expert understanding which in turn will generate benefits for the various public audiences with which the professionals interact.

Context:
Architectural models are used throughout the design process. They include concept models, construction models, 1:1 models and presentation models. Although architectural models have much in common with other 3D representations, the complexity of representing a building, the public impact of permanent construction and specific questions of scale set them apart. Like architectural drawings, their significance is that they are tools for thought and communication; they help to make invisible design processes visible and they document moments of communication that are otherwise ephemeral. Unlike 2D depictions, however, they directlyconvey the embodied 3D qualities of a building and have, since the Renaissance, been seen as the most comprehensible form of architectural representation. Yet whilst the relevance of architectural models is acknowledged by a number of different research and practice-based constituencies: students, architects and designers who use them; model-makers who construct them; curators who look after, display and interpret them; conservators who maintain them; and academics who research them, to date, no forum for knowledge exchange exists; nor is there a comprehensive, searchable resource that lists or attempts to list the institutions in which such collections are housed.

This project is timely for a number of reasons. Museums are showing a renewed interest in their model collections; digital modelling and 3D printing are diversifying the way that models can be generated, increasing their incidence in the creative field; and developments in 3D scanning are offering new modes of access to objects in storage (which models typically are). Finally, in a period of unprecedented urban expansion, many museums are prioritising architecture as a key area for public education and engagement and seeking innovative ways to display architecture within museum walls. Now is the ideal moment to harness this momentum.

Three specialist workshops will bring together the different constituencies that use models: academics, architectural students and practitioners, curators and museum educators. The workshops will feature papers focusing on concrete case studies as well as model-making sessions to encourage understanding of embodied knowledge and practical thinking. Content will be disseminated online as well as through a scholarly publication. Each workshop will focus on a specific question:

Workshop 1. What is an architectural model?
Workshop 2. How do we make and use architectural models?
Workshop 3. How do we interpret architectural models?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The V&amp;amp;A, the Architekturmuseum of the Technische Universit&amp;auml;t Munich and Sir J. Soane's Museum provide a gateway to engagement with non-academic communities. As well as housing model collections of national and international importance, these institutions have strong specialist expertise in models, are inherently committed to public-facing activities and have established longstanding links with individuals, communities and organisations -cultural, artistic and commercial- working in the field. The network can draw on their existing experience and infrastructure to engage a variety of users and audiences and maximise the network's impact.

1. Museums holding architectural models worldwide
Architectural museums, and museums that are not primarily architectural but hold such models in their collections would benefit from network activities that will generate insights and ideas which, in the longer term, could form the basis of new strategies and collaborative partnerships to increase the visibility of their collections and engage academics, heritage professionals and non-specialists in the use of them.

2. Architects and model makers worldwide
For this constituency, the network activities and online content it generates will form a spring-board and inspiration for new work. Contacts with the architectural profession will be facilitated by the RIBA (40,000 members worldwide) and the AA (50,000 members worldwide), and professional model makers will be targeted through involvement in the network workshops.

3. Specialists in / potential users of 3D modelling technology
The research unit MAP of the French CNRS will be our principal link with the practitioner community within the Digital Humanities. Through their involvement, the network will explore ways in which the potential of 3D-modelling can be harnessed and exploited to maximum effect within the museum and heritage sector - of particular importance given that in some respects British institutions appear to be laggingbehind their Continental European counterparts in the application of these technologies.

4. General public
Models are a continual source of fascination to the general public, seemingly transcending age, gender, class and culture. Existing and potential museum users will benefit from the network's public initiatives, which will include a free exhibition at the AA. The heritage institutions involved in the network offer a substantial public audience for the network's activities: e.g. Sir J. Soane's Museum sees c. 120.000 visitors p.a., the Pinakothek der Moderne, housing the Architekturmuseum in Munich, c. 1 mil visitors p.a., the V&amp;amp;A c. 3.7 mil visitors p.a.

ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES:
The network's core partners will facilitate engagement through their institutional communication channels, including members' newsletters/magazines, websites, online journals and social media. Further impact will also be achieved through the following project activities:

1. Online resources
We will establish network project webpages linked to the V&amp;amp;A website and explore opportunities to develop links between and, where appropriate, content on, other established sites, such as that of ICAM (International Centre for Advanced Materials. This will provide an opportunity to pilot a 'one-stop shop' online portal of architectural models and plan for the resources that would be needed to develop it into a virtual museum.

2. Project events
* Three specialist workshops for museum curators and conservators, architects, model-makers and academics.

* Participatory public event at the RIBA in their 'Tuesday Late' series: a free evening featuring talks, events, performance, film and music on a given theme.

* The research will underpin a free, public exhibition at the AA (similar exhibitions in the past have attracted 3000 to 4000 visitors over a 1-month period, with interest from the practicing architectural community, the architecturally curious public and the press).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35552</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P01481X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
