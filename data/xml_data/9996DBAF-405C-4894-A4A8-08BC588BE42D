The overall aim is underpinned by four main objectives:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>To bring together a range of national and international contexts, varied methodological and multidisciplinary views, including contributions from sociology, social policy, the creative arts and other disciplines to explore and critically engage with issues of diversity.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To contribute to developing and sharing research which critically reflects diversity as a lived reality attached to advantaged and disadvantaged groups: how does ?diversity? compel a (personal, institutional, academic) response from those occupying (non)normative identities? What different, even diverse, forms of (dis)engagement does this produce and/or fail?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To strengthen empirical and academic work by bringing together leading researchers in the UK with esteemed overseas researchers, who are working in the fields of diversity, intersectionality, policy-legal development. These are situated in the context of State retrenchment and with a view towards promoting knowledge generation and knowledge transfer between academic and non-academic research user.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To establish further dialogue with research users including policymakers, and practitioners working with diverse users. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The seminars will be structured around the following themes:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Different Subject, Diverse Strands&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Diversity at the (Inter)discipline Divisive Realities&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Lived Experiences, Diversity Dis-junctures Diverse Policies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Colliding Concerns Diverse Publics&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Political Plurality, Public Potential?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Two-day International Conference: Critical Diversities: Policies, Perspectives, Practices.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>A new Routledge Book Series on Advances in Critical Diversities will be launched, edited by Yvette Taylor and Sally Hines.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Series is motivated by the importance of providing accessible knowledge transfer and impact generation to user-groups and stakeholders, and the PI/CO-I have strong records of this . Thus, one of the key aims of the project is to create dialogue between academic, policy maker, and practioner and user-group communities and, the project explicitly foregrounds the importance of knowledge and practice sharing between (non)academic members. A range of individuals, groups and organisations from across a range of academic and non-academic user groups were consulted and expressed interest in participating in the seminar series and contributing to discussions as audience members. These include: the Government Equalities Office; the Equality and Human Rights Commission; Equalities Network; Stonewall; Equality Challenge Unit; Runnymede Trust and the Young Foundation; Kids Company, Serious about Youth, the Family and Parenting Institute and the Daycare Trust. 

These users will benefit from the series in terms of taking forward into their agencies the key messages that emerge out of different perspectives drawn from cross-disciplinary and international comparative dialogue. Thus the Series will potentially inform policy, NGO and campaigning organisations in influencing agency recommendations, demonstrating measurable user-impact.

We will draw on dissemination practices established within the Weeks Centre for Social and Policy Research at LSBU and CIGS University of Leeds. Collaboration between these two Centres will enable the project at all stages of its lifespan to connect with research expertise in both the realms of the social: Sociology; Social Policy, and Cultural Studies: both institutions have international reputations for research around, gender and sexual identity; diversity and equality; intersectionality; race and ethnicity; educational inequalities; space and place, the environment - at methodological and conceptual levels. 

We will also draw on the individual dissemination resources of the applicants including the websites of, and extensive mailing lists attached to the Weeks Centre and CIGS. A dedicated webpage will be set up at www.lsbu.ac.uk to promote the seminar series as a whole and the individual seminars, and we will use this to upload bulletins and summary notes of seminars, which draw on the key issues emerging from the individual presentations and the overall series debates. We also plan to access the mailing lists/databases established through the research centres at LSBU and Leeds; the applicants own networks and those provided by named users to publicise the event. The methods we will use to promote and advertise the series and individual seminars include email notifications on the dedicated web-page and both universities' website and the distribution of leaflets and posters at related events.

We will seek to gain media coverage to promote the seminar series and highlight key issues emerging from the seminar debates using our existing media contacts. An innovative media forum will be our use of community radio. The PI has used radio to publicise her research (Tyne Tees, Radio 4). 'Colourful Radio FM' is a possible site of communication which features a combination of spot-advertising, read-outs, and the use of online banners on its website. We will draw on the applicants' well-established contacts within youth services, local authority departments, UCU, voluntary sector services and community organisations to promote and publicise the event in related publications and professional newsletters.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16378</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Academic Forum member The Runnymede Trust.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B585AE60-8505-40DC-9244-4C4428BF72FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Given the diversity and equality remit of the Series, and my work more generally, I was invited to become an Academic Forum member The Runnymede Trust, this has involved several meetings, email discussions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb6c8cce323.43404756</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.runnymedetrust.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Weeks Centre for Social and Policy Research Summer Newsletter (2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:id>40BD02ED-77D5-4728-A8B0-2936A6957076</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article by PhD presenter Ellis Ciruello.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1126270649.14095282b1b0e52</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://weekscentreforsocialandpolicyresearch.wordpress.com/newsletters/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Marie Curie European Funds</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F35FB0EA-3271-4BE1-8B92-BCDC8D4B63A1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb9671ea2a1.73191297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Please note that no 'Impact Statement' was submitted for this successful grant which fell before the period of this being required. 

That said, the Series was motivated by the importance of providing accessible knowledge transfer and impact generation to usergroups and stakeholders. It is difficult to gauge the qualitative impact of this other than to note ongoing positive relations, and joint events, beyond the funding period. 

 A range of individuals, groups and organisations from across a range of academic and non-academic user groups were consulted and expressed interest in participating in the seminar series and contributing to discussions as audience members. These included: the Government Equalities Office; the Equality and Human Rights Commission; Equalities Network; Stonewall; Equality Challenge Unit; Runnymede Trust and the Young Foundation; Kids Company, Serious about Youth, the Family and Parenting Institute and the Daycare Trust.

The PI continues to develop links from the Series (e.g. Gender Intelligence, Metropolitan Community Church) with Series participants from both inside and outside of academia, often working of shared concerns (e.g. gender inequalities, equalities legislation, pedagogy in and beyond Higher Education). A Seminar 'Transology: Thinking &amp;amp; Researching with Transgender People in Mind,' took place May 2015 and a BSA-funded seminar on TransForming Research will take place 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D326E4F0-9335-4994-8A15-8D7916A9149E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb34a6fe837.89697934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Series generated contemporary considerations of 'diversity' as currently resonating with changing legal and policy landscapes and (post)welfare regimes. Usefully, it developed new knowledge in working across career stage, disciplines, and inside-outside academia, highlighting the importance of probing beyond the boundaries of specific territorial-legislative domains in order to develop a more international, intersectional focus. 

A key strength of the Series was the range of backgrounds and career stages from which the participants engaged, including contributions from leading, international academics across disciplinary boundaries (Sociology; Social Policy; Social Work; Psychology; Human Geography; Law; Politics; Gender-Women's Studies) and methodological approaches.

These interests and networks have inspired ongoing projects, such as with Gender Intelligence who are co-organising a Seminar 'Transology: Thinking &amp;amp; Researching with Transgender People in Mind,' with PI at the Weeks Centre for Social and Policy Research (May 2015). The PI's institution have committed to funding further events, and offered free bespoke conference accommodation throughout the duration of the grant. The invitation and funding of non-academic audiences contributed to the fostering 'diverse publics' and this approach is developed in a forthcoming ESRC submission with 5 partner institutions, on the substantive theme of youth, religion and sexuality. The books Series Critical Diversities: Policies, Practices and Perspectives(Routledge) was launched at the end conference, with attracted a large audience (n=80). The PI also instigated a proposal for another book Series Gender and Education (Palgrave), now successfully contracted. 

Key achievements:
?Fostering 'public sociology' as reflected in the balance of non-academic speakers and attendees, and in the continued relations post-Series. This also involved liaising with other professional networks such as the Gender and Education Association, Fulbright and the British Sociological Association to effectively publicise, supported PI by live tweeting at all events (see #CriticalDiversities) 

?Developing early career capacity and success, through cross disciplinary and cross-career panels, with dedicated early career prizes for best papers. An innovative workshop, vastly departing from the usual conference format was supported at the end conference, and a blog post written thereafter, 'Reflections on Critical Diversities'
https://weekscentreforsocialandpolicyresearch.wordpress.com/2014/09/01/reflections-on-the-critical-diversities-the-intersection-conference-july-2014/

?Showcasing interdisciplinary 'diversity' publications and launching the Critical Diversities book Series, which several attendees/presenters have submitted to. 

The PI conducted the Series alone as the Co-I was unable to fulfil her commitments on the project; the PI acted alone in enabling and soliciting postings, articles and recordings across 2yrs., and in tweeting @WeeksCentre using #CriticalDiversities. The Co-I attended and presented at the end conference, as a valued participant. Arguably, some of the LSBU-Leeds PI-Co-I as specific cross-institutional benefits were under-realised given the circumstances. Unfortunately our highly respected and internationally esteemed conference keynote cancelled at the last minute due to illness, to the disappointment of some conference delegates; overall the conference was very successful.
