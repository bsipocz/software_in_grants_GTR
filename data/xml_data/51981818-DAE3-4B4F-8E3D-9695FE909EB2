The prion protein is central to prion diseases such as CJD and BSE and has been shown to bind to amyloid beta peptides which are associated with Alzheimer?s disease. Finding out how important this interaction either by preventing it using chemical compounds or by comparing the binding to other proteins may help it developing treatments for the disease.
We also recently showed that patients who had received injections of human growth hormone made human pituitaries and who later died of CJD also had high levels of proteins normally associated with Alzheimer?s disease, despite dying at a relatively young age. We have obtained vials of growth hormone from the same batches used to treat these individuals and plan to inject them into mice to see if they also develop high levels of the Alzheimer?s disease associated proteins. If this confirms the earlier result it will tell us much about how Alzheimer?s disease spreads within body and may also mean the surgical instruments that have been used on patients with Alzheimer?s disease may need to be specially treated before being re-used to prevent the disease being given other people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The programme has two main aims, the first of which is to better understand the role of the cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) in Alzheimer?s disease (AD), particularly its importance relative to other potential cellular acceptors of the AD-associated amyloid beta peptides, by using cellular models of over-expression/gene silencing and to screen focussed libraries to identify tool compounds able to inhibit the interaction. We also plan use the well characterised interaction with PrPC to better biophysically define amyloid-beta species using asymmetric flow field flow fractionation and electron microscopy (in collaboration with Professor Helen Saibil at Birkbeck). Utilising our well-characterised PK1 cells which are capable of sustaining robust levels of prion infection, alongside mouse models of prion disease and human APP-expressing transgenic mice we also plan to better characterise what (if any) impact amyloid-beta and prions have on the each other in the development of prion disease and AD. These studies will utilise histopathological analysis to monitor the spread of both AD and prion pathogenesis, alongside the automated scrapie cell assay to measure the prion infectious titre.
The other main objective utilises the Unit?s experience in studying prion disease to better understand the ?prion-like? spread of AD. We have access to cadaveric preparations of human growth hormone which we have previously identified as being potentially responsible for the transmission of amyloid-beta pathology and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in clinical cases and to AD brain samples from typical, rapidly progressing and posterior cortical atrophy cases which we have already shown to give rise to structurally distinct amyloid fibres by solid state NMR. We propose to extensively characterise all these samples in: transmission studies using mouse models expressing human APP, biochemically using ultrasensitive immunoassays (in collaboration with Professor Dominic Walsh, Harvard), biophysically by fibre extension followed by NMR (in collaboration with Dr Robert Tycko, NIH), and in cellular models of neurodegeneration (with Professor Dominic Walsh).
A better understanding of the potential transmissibility of AD has obvious public health implications especially for the decontamination of neurosurgical instruments, as well as permitting more informed risk assessment of the individuals who received preparations of the cadaveric human growth hormone.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37968</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UP_1604/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
