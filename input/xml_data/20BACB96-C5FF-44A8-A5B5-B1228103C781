It will look in detail at the work of writers, commentators and journalists who have written extensively on Italy's relationship with the Islamic world and it will examine the media - ranging from journalistic comment, foreign correspondence, collections of essays, autobiographies, travel writing and even fiction - in which their views have been expressed. \n\nIt will thus reveal the framework in which ideas on Italy and the Islamic world have been advanced; the range of concepts for understanding identity and difference that are relied upon; the rhetorical devices and figures of speech that are used most consistently. Through this kind of analysis, the project will show how, over an exceptionally dramatic period of time, the Islamic world has been presented as an internal actor within Italian society, as a neighbouring presence, as a site of alternative civilization or as a minatory other. \n\nThe project will examine how the rapid development of an easily visible Islamic presence within Italy impacts on the way in which the Islamic world in general is represented. It will show how writings on Italy's relationship with the Islamic world reveal underlying issues, questions and preoccupations concerning globalization, migration, and the meaning of national identity in an increasingly inter-connected and multicultural world. \n\nThe analysis of contrasting views and characterizations of the Islamic world in contemporary Italy will also look at the longer history of the representation of the Muslim world within Italian culture. By considering writing on the same subject that appeared at other key moments in modern Italian history, the project will place current views on the Islamic world in comparison/ contrast with previous ways of understanding similarity, identity and difference.\n\nThe outputs of the proposal will be three substantial articles. The first will examine the various currents of anti-Islamic feeling that have found expression in contemporary Italy and how they have represented the Muslim world. The second article will be concerned with more nuanced and reflective views on Italy and the Islamic world that have been expressed by various voices and through different media during the same period of time. The third will relate contemporary perceptions to the longer history of representing the Islamic world within modern Italian culture.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>\n\nIn examining the complexities of the representation of the Islamic world over an exceptionally dramatic period of time, the project will:\n\n1. Provide a new perspective on the meanings that attach to constructions of Italian national identity. It will contribute significantly to the way in which the cultural reality of contemporary Italy is considered within the academy.\n\n2. Through its examination of one country, the project will participate in the wider debate concerning Western Europe's relationship with the Islamic world.\n\n3. The topicality of the issues that the project confronts is such that it will be of interest to the community outside the academy. Through a series of talks at the Italian Cultural Institute and through the British-Italian Society, the findings of the project will be broadcast widely.\n\n4. The project will contribute to our understanding of an issue of crucial societal importance, namely the increasing porosity of national cultures. It will serve to inform the community as a whole of the series of issues and anxieties that lie behind one national culture's - Italy's - relationship with the Islamic world.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29952</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture, University of Cambridge, 28 November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A55EF03-BA27-48CE-B84B-394CA7462F8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk on Representations of Italy and the Islamic World was to postgraduates and members of the staff at the University of Cambridge.

The original intention was to publish three articles. In developing the project and in linking its range of inquiry to the project, Transnationalizing Modern Languages, I have now published a major monograph: 'Italy, Islam and the Islamic World: Representations and reflections from 9/11 to the Arab Uprisings' (Oxford: Peter Lang, 2016). The monograph is of clear importance to large sectors of the specialist and non-specialist community in providing a detailed analysis of the types of representation of the Islamic world that have been produced in Italy. The monograph addresses a question of urgent topical concern. It also engages with a range of urgent methodological questions concerning the nature of Italy that is studied through the discipline of Italian studies. I have spoken on the topic at numerous conferences and have presented a seminar (Nov 2013) at the Watershed Arts Centre - intended to reach a wide public audience - in Bristol on European representations of the Islamic world. I have been given presentations on the book at a range of institutions, including the Herford Memorial Lecture at the University of Manchester (April 2016). The book is of interest to the academic community in indicating how the topic of the representation of the Islamic world can be studied in Italian studies. The text is also clearly relevant to a larger audience. I have actively pursued the dissemination of its findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>641FD118-E967-4550-8CAB-FEBC415B1395</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5437979251ba77.79392685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I began research on this project with the intention of examining how the Islamic world has been represented in Italy since 2001. The intention was to produce three articles. During my research the Arab Spring occurred and, with the permission of the AHRC, I have expanded my aims to produce a monograph. The monograph, 'Italy, Islam and the Islamic World: Representations and Reflections from 9/11 to the Arab Uprisings' (Oxford: Peter Lang) was published in January 2016. The research has uncovered the depth of anti-Islamic feeling in Italy and the range of media through which it has been articulated. The work, at the same time, has delved into the range of fictional and non-fictional interventions into the debate on Italy's relationship with Islam, showing the extent of constructive engagements with the multi-cultural reality of contemporary Italy. The work done in the project is of self-evident topical importance. The engagement activities of the project have led me to develop a range of contacts in the UK and Italy that will lead to collaborative research projects in the near future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I expanded the aim of my original project. Instead of writing three articles, I have produced one article and a monograph on the subject of the representation of Islam and the Islamic world in Italy from 9/11 to the Arab uprisings. The conclusion addresses the representation of Islamic state. The monograph represents a major statement about how the Islamic world has been seen in Italy from 2001 to 2011, spanning fiction and non-fiction as well as currents of representation which run from the clearly xenophobic to the much more informed and constructive representation of a multi-cultural environment of contemporary Italy. The questions examined by the book are of urgent topicality and the book will be of relevance to large sectors of the specialist and non-specialist community. The book also offers, methodologically, a clear statement of how important issues can be addressed through literary and cultural analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3EE02D44-66AC-4E6B-9E21-9670CDBAB31A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54379535d39ef6.20329754</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=89591&amp;cid=552&amp;concordeid=431976</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>52499FDA-E5A6-4EB3-9671-D03E8CB90B2C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Italy, Islam and the Islamic World: Representations and Reflections from 9/11 to the Arab Uprisings</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4f90722605fc5ada8c6c1557944b677"><gtr:id>b4f90722605fc5ada8c6c1557944b677</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burdett C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-0343-1976-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d816f9552945.79634580</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4AF5B6AB-0B07-44FE-AEDC-99CD48C18F59</gtr:id><gtr:title>Representations of the Islamic community in Italy 2001-2011</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Romance Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8b01d2267fbc2eee40b4b741c9786d06"><gtr:id>8b01d2267fbc2eee40b4b741c9786d06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burdett C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d085085edca9e7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I027355/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7378EED-C28D-4F1E-9E28-5D9E75964912</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Italian studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
