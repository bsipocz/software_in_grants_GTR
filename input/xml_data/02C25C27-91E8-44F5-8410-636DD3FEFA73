&lt;p>The proposed project will examine the resilience of language in the domain of phonology, namely, the system of forms used to distinguish meaning in language.

&lt;p>We will investigate the type of handshapes used in home signs to examine whether home sign systems have these foundational properties for phonology seen in conventional sign languages such as British Sign Language and spoken languages such as English and Chinese.

There are two types of academic beneficiaries: (AC1) researchers in developmental psychology (in particular language development) and in linguistics and (AC2) the research assistant and the casual research assistant employed by the project. The AC1 group will benefit from the new insights into what biological endowment children bring to the task of language acquisition in the domain of phonology, which has never been investigated before. Furthermore, researchers who are interested in assessment tools for development of sign language may benefit from the hand shape coding scheme for the proposed project. The scheme may lay a foundation for future assessment tools for phonological development in deaf children learning a conventional sign language. We will ensure that the AC1 group will notice our finding by presenting our results in a general conference for child development and in a high-visibility journal (if possible in a multi-disciplinary journal such as PNAS) that are relevant to both basic and applied researchers in the relevant fields. The AC2 group will benefit from hands-on experience in the cutting edge research and from establishing a collaborative connection to the world's leading psychologist, Prof. Susan Goldin-Meadow and linguist, Prof. Diane Brentari. These benefits will enhance their career opportunities in research. We will ensure that the project members get these benefits by engaging them in all aspects of the project that they are qualified to contribute (the research assistant will be engaged in more aspects than the casual research assistant). 

There are two types of non-academic beneficiaries: (NA1) general public who are interested in child development and/or in psychology, (NA2) the Deaf community. The NA1 group will benefit from inspiration and raised interest levels in scientific study of child development. We will ensure that the NA1 group have access to our findings by disseminating our findings through the website and newsletters of the University of Birmingham Infant and Child Laboratory and through oral presentations in an annual information meeting held by the School of Psychology for Sixth-form college students who are considering studying psychology. As for the NA2 group, we will feed our findings to researchers who are developing assessment tools for phonological development in children who are learning sign language as their first language. Our finding can be applied to such assessment tools to pick up Deaf children with delay in language development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78228</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Chicago</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>A60FAD7D-1711-48DB-B07B-1607260688A5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d910c0b9d910de-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This describe the collaboration developed in the project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Human children's ability to create language: Insights into language evolution</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8054E403-FD0F-4632-9CAA-A309F4EB4399</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A seminar talk in the Evolutionary Anthropology group in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Durham.

We investigated the type of handshapes used in home signs to examine whether home sign systems have these foundational properties for phonology. We found evidence that deaf children spontaneously introduced discreteness and duality of patterning into their communication system, for the US sample but not for the Taiwanese sample. Though cross-cultural differences require further explanation from future research, this project demonstrated that children without linguistic input can introduce discreteness and duality of patterning in their communication system.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The coding scheme for hand shapes in gestures that we will use may lay a foundation for a future clinical assessment tool for phonological development in children acquiring sign language.
