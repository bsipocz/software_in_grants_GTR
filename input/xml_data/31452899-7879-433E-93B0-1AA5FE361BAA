Fluidized Bed (CFB): Combustion, Materials and Modelling (USC-CFB-CMM)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M01536X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>To achieve the UK's ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 without compromising energy security, the UK's conventional power plants must be operated in a flexible manner in terms of high efficiency, using alternative fuels (e.g. biomass) and integrating technologies for carbon abatement (e.g. Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS). Major reviews conducted by International Energy Agency in 2013 on the current status of the most advanced solid fuel-based conventional power generation technologies clearly show that ultra-supercritical (USC) steam Rankine cycle power generation combined with Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) combustion technology is the most viable alternative to the pulverised coal (PC)-based USC power generation. In addition, USC/CFB has a number of advantages over USC/PC, particularly regarding fuel flexibility. 

However, there are still many fundamental research and technical challenges facing the development of USC-CFB technology. In particular, combustion issues related to safe and stable operation of CFB boilers when burning a variety of solid fuels are not yet fully understood and there is a great need to develop novel materials that will be able to cope with adverse conditions associated with USC/CFB operations.

This consortium brings together internationally recognised research experts from Universities of Leeds, Nottingham and Warwick in the fields of conventional power generation, fluidized bed combustion, power plant materials, modelling and control with the strong supports of industrial partners in Alstom, Doosan Babcock, Foster Wheeler and E.ON and its international academic partner - Tsinghua University. The project proposed aims to maximize the benefits of USC/CFB in terms of power generation efficiency, fuel flexibility including biomass and integration with CO2 capture by conducting research that addresses the key challenges in combustion, materials and modelling. The specific project objectives are:

(1) To understand how the combustion of a variety of fuels affects bed material agglomeration, fouling and corrosion of boiler heat exchanger tubes and emissions

(2) To understand the influence of the hostile conditions in USC/CFB in terms of creep and oxidation/corrosion resistance on ferritic, austenitic and Ni-based materials and to use the knowledge gained to develop coatings, enablng these materials to withstand the higher temperatures and pressures

(3) To investigate the additional impacts on combustion, emissions and materials when a USC/CFB is operating in the oxy-fuel combustion mode

(4) To develop a whole USC/CFB power plant dynamic model and to use the model to study optimal process operation strategies for higher efficiencies and better fuel flexibility

To achieve the proposed research aim and objectives and address the fundamental challenges, four inter-connected work packages composed of experimental and modelling studies will be completed:

(1) WP1 - Investigating CFB combustion issues through combustion tests at laboratory- and pilot-scales
(2) WP2 - Evaluating hostile conditions of USC/CFB on candidate materials
(3) WP3 - Development of surface engineered coatings &amp;amp; mechanical testing of coated alloys
(4) wp4 - USC/CFB system modelling</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Ultra-supercritical (USC) steam power generation combined with circulating fluidization (CFB) (USC/CFB) is the most viable alternative to USC/PC (pulverised coal) which represents the most advanced coal-power generation technology currently available to the conventional power generation industry. However, USC/CFB has a number of advantages over USC/PC, particularly regarding fuel flexibility. The proposed project has the potential to have a significant impact for the UK both in terms of Academic and industrial Impacts, and Economic and Societal Benefits. The potential impacts and benefits will be delivered by setting up a successful Partnership, maximising the benefits to the Users and Beneficiaries including the Trained Workforce on the project and establishing a range of effective Communication, Exploitation and Engagement Strategies.

The researchers trained through the project will provide high quality expertise for the power generation sector and its associated sectors in materials and modelling and control. Dozens of PhD students of the three partner universities working in the related research fields will be given opportunities to fully engage with the project teams, for example, through doing mini-projects alongside the employed PDRAs, attending research team meetings and consortium meetings, to enhance the academic impact at the partner universities.

The project will act as a catalyst for encouraging allied research and development of ultra-supercritical steam power generation, fluidized bed combustion, high temperature materials and coating, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and power plant system modelling. The successful outcome of this project, together with our current research portfolio of Conventional Power Generation, CCS, Power Plant Materials and Modelling will contribute to ensuring the UK can claim an international reputation in these research areas and thus encourage international students and researchers in the field to study in the UK. Know-how acquired in this project for USC/CFB will be of direct benefit to academics, conventional power generation, materials and CCS research communities, power generation, steel and energy industries, energy policy makers/regulators, and government departments such as DECC.

Successful delivery of the proposed research on USC/CFB will provide the UK with a platform to lead this new technology in the future, which will bring economic and societal benefits. There are many additional beneficiaries of the new technology in the long term including the public and industry who are the users of electricity.

The Project Consortium brings together strong research expertise in Power Plant Combustion Engineering, Chemical Engineering/Chemistry, Materials and Modelling, and the support from its industrial partners encompassing power plant technology developers and power generator. There are excellent links and proven working relationships between the project academic partners and the industrial partners.

Monthly local research team meetings, quarterly project consortium meetings and six-monthly Steering Committee meetings will be held to report research findings, to discuss any technical or management issues, and future research and implementation plans.

Knowledge Transfer Office of each partner university will liaise with industrial partners and other potential users of the developed IPs for commercial exploitation.

Findings with academic value will be disseminated at key international conferences and published with open access with the leading peer reviewed journals. We will host at least one workshop on Conventional Power Generation during the project period with the workshop fully open to the Conventional Power, Materials and CCS research communities and relevant industries. We will further disseminate the project results to national and international organisations and policy makers (e.g. DECC, Parliamentary Groups) through the established connections.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1033385</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project Kick-off meeting involving all industrial partners and academic partners, related researchers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91704188-D226-451F-812C-935C8966495A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 20 people attended project formal kick-off meeting with all national/international industrial partners present.

Fluidised bed combustion tests of woody and non-woody biomasses with the 20kWth and 200kWth Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB) combustors under air and oxy-fuel combustion conditions: (a) Simply replacing the air with similar 21 vol% O2 in CO2 (oxy-fuel) results in a significant decrease in gas temperatures and ultimately leads to the extinction of the biomass flame mainly due to the larger specific heat of CO2 compared to N2. To keep a similar temperature profile achieved under air combustion conditions, the oxygen concentration in O2/CO2 mixture has to be increased to 30 vol%. (b) Special attention needs to be paid to a number of combustion issues including NOx and CO emissions, ash deposition, bed material sintering/agglomeration and defluidization. In particular, for non-woody biomass fuels such as straw and miscanthus, agglomeration and defluidization can happen at bed temperatures as low as 850 degree C. In order to operate the BFB combustors at higher temperatures without the issue of agglomeration and defluidization, alternative bed materials other than silica sand or additives need to be used.

2. High temperature corrosion testing: Laser clad and HVOF sprayed Stellite 6 coating (Co-Cr-W-C alloy) and Nickel aluminide (NiAl) intermetallic coatings were studied in chlorine rich environment with KCl at 700 &amp;deg;C. SEM/ EDX and PXRD analysis with Rietveld refinement were used for assessment of the attack and for analysis of the scales. For Stellite-6 coatings, the presence of KCl on the surface led to severe Cr depletion from the HVOF coating (to 1 wt.%). The laser-clad sample performed significantly better in KCl-deposit-induced corrosion. For NiAl coatings, it also showed superior corrosion resistance to the attack of KCl owing to the formation of a coherence and dense Al2O3 layer on the stainless steel, which effectively protected the steel from further oxidation attack.

3. High temperature mechanical testing: Creep tests were conducted at 700 &amp;deg;C on free-standing HVOF sprayed Stellite 6 coating using a small punch (SP) creep test method. The tested samples were subjected to loadings ranging from 81N to 250N and the coatings had a lifetime span ranging from several minutes to over 1300 hours. 

4. Simulation of fluidized bed based power plants: While providing a fast and accurate tool for simulating fluidized beds, the major limitations of classical zero-dimensional ideal reactor models used in process simulations, such as Aspen Plus&amp;reg;, become irreconcilable. Examples of the limitations include the difficulties in incorporating heat absorption by the water wall and super-heaters and inferring thermal reciprocity between each reactor model/module. This project adopts a novel modelling approach to address these limitations by incorporating an external model that marries the advantages of zone method and Aspen Plus to the greatest extent. A steady state operation of a 300kWth BFB combustor was simulated using the developed modelling approach and the modelling results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The relatively modest computing demand of the model demonstrates its potential to be incorporated into the process simulation of a whole power plant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key findings have been discussed with the industrial partners at the regular project meetings. The industrial partners are best placed to consider the potential use of the findings at the earliest possible opportunities. Several conference presentations were made to disseminate the research findings to other interested academic researchers, industry and other stakeholders. For example, 'A study of agglomeration processes during biomass combustion in a pilot scale, bubbling fluidised bed combustor (BFBC)' was presented at the 11th ECCRIA (European Conference on Coal Research and its Applications) conference in 2016 and 'Further improvement of fluidized bed models by incorporating zone method with Aspen Plus interface' was presented at the 8th International Conference on Applied Energy in 2016.
