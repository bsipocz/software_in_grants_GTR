In support of the above the following specific research activities will be undertaken:
- Dr. Orucevic and Prof. Kruger will undertake the design, testing and implementation of main MOT 
 structures and auxiliary structures;
- Different operational schemes of MOT will be explored and characterised (e.g., 2D MOT, 2D+ MOT, 
 pyramidal MOT, etc.);
- The system integration of MOTs with other devices, for example atom chips and printed circuit boards 
 (PCB), will be tested;
- Prototypes will be investigated both separately and as a part of larger experimental cold-atom setup.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's primary impact is in fundamental and applied cold atom research via research undertaken in optimising MOT technical characteristics. This will identify the use of new combinations of magnetic field strengths, laser characteristics and cold atom cloud shapes to optimise MOT design for specific applications. This will add to the fundamental research base, with established routes of scientific interaction being employed to disseminate results.

The project will also deliver significant impact on applied cold atom research nationally and internationally. The production of integrated MOT assemblies via AM will represent a step change in the maturity of the cold atoms research supply chain, with 'off the shelf' MOT designs removing the need for the bespoke MOT builds that typify current cold atom applied research. Making available a key cold atom functionality that can simply be acquired and installed will significantly reduce the resources required to support applied research, enabling a significant increase in the level of cold atom activity being undertaken, whilst particularly facilitating the translation of cold atom technology into the commercial environment, as required to achieve the aspirations of the UK National QT Programme. Established connections to industry within the Departments of Physics and Astronomy and ASL will be leveraged, supporting the next step of Knowledge Transfer to industry. An example of such a connection that will be pursued by the project is based around the strategic partnership with e2v, a major UK electronics. e2v have, over the past three years, developed strong capability in cold atom quantum technology, including new dedicated laboratories and staff at their Chelmsford headquarters. e2v will be engaged as a key
end user, building on their existing collaboration with academic and industrial partners in UK Quantum Technology Hub for Sensors and Metrology of which both Universities of Sussex and Nottingham are members. e2v's growing interest in cold atom technologies, and associated collaborations, provides a ready-made route for commercialising the MOT innovations that emerge from the project.

The team will seek, in collaboration with our partners, to engage widely with industry stakeholders such as UHV components design and manufacturing companies, and disseminate appropriate information about project progress to developers in the commercial sector, as well as using the team's existing cold atom sensor development collaborations. The team is working closely with our partners in the UK Quantum Technology Hub for Sensors and Metrology on several projects, including for example the development of back-pack-sized cold-atom gravity sensors that could be revolutionized by the incorporation of new MOT functionalities. Similarly, we have several efforts underway to better support the development of components for quantum sensors. This will provide an excellent means by which to promote the potential of the AM MOT capabilities across UK cold-atom community, and to meet and work with developers and end-users.

The project will also use the Knowledge Transfer Networks (KTNs) to broaden impact. In particular, we will use KTN interactive web portals to target potential beneficiaries. This will be complemented by presentations to key KTN personnel, using their expertise as a route to a wide range of connections. With growing commercial interest, the project will make use of more direct tools of involvement, such as industry events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R020442/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
