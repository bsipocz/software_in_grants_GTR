Around the world antibiotic resistance is a major problem, in recent years increasing numbers of bacteria which are Multiply Drug Resistant (MDR) - resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics are being isolated. Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics in a number of ways, one mechanism they use is known as efflux. Efflux pumps are able to pump antibiotics out of the bacterial cell; they also pump biocides (disinfectants). The use of biocides in farming has increased in recent years as the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animals has been reduced. Concern has been raised about the potential for biocides to cause antibiotic resistance by selecting for mutant bacteria which produce a greater number of efflux pumps. One route by which people can become infected with pathogenic bacteria is via food, Salmonella are the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in the U.K and the majority of infections are via contaminated food. In recent work the applicants have shown that exposure of Salmonella to various biocides (disinfectants) used on farms can result in selection of mutants which are MDR but are not able to grow as well as their parent. However these experiments used multiple exposures to biocides and it is not clear how many exposures are needed to select MDR, and whether the loss of fitness (ability to grow and infect human cells) is linked to development of MDR. This proposal aims to identify how many biocide exposures are needed to select MDR and whether the fitness cost is linked by performing stepwise exposure experiments and keeping mutants after each exposure. These mutants will then be examined and the antibiotic resistance and fitness measured. These experiments will allow the development of MDR over time to be followed. It is likely that the repeated biocide exposures will select for mutants with multiple mutations within their genomes. Recent development of new sequencing technologies have allowed whole genomes to be sequenced rapidly for relatively little cost. This proposal aims to sequence the genomes of biocide selected mutants to identify mutations involved in biocide-antibiotic cross resistance. The result of these mutations on expression of all the genes of salmonella will be measured as will the ability of mutants to grow in the presence of over 2000 compounds. These results will help assign function to the mutations identified and understand how they affect antibiotic resistance and fitness. The assembly of genome, transcriptome (expression profile of all genes) and phenotype (ability to grow in a range of conditions) is a powerful tool to understand the mechanisms of resistance. The importance of mutations identified in this study will be assessed in two ways. Firstly specific mutations will be re-created in a normal Salmonella strain and the effect on antibiotic resistance and fitness evaluated. Secondly a group of current isolates of MDR Salmonella from animals will be studied for the presence of these mutations in order to identify whether they are found in 'real-world' isolates. The expected outcomes are: An understanding of the mechanisms by which biocides can select antibiotic resistance and an evaluation of whether this is a threat to human health. A better understanding of the fundamental biology of Salmonella. Identification of new target genes for development of novel antibiotics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Antibiotic resistance is a global problem with increasing numbers of bacteria (including Salmonella) being isolated which are multiply drug resistant (MDR). The use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine is one factor driving antibiotic resistance although use of antibiotics as growth promoters has been banned. Concern has been raised about the potential for biocides to select for antibiotic resistant mutants as some mechanisms of resistance (efflux) confer resistance to both biocides and antibiotics. In recent work the applicants have shown that repeated sub-lethal exposure of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to biocides selects for mutants which are MDR. This repeated exposure did however lead to a fitness cost and mutants were unable to invade Caco-2 cells efficiently in tissue culture. Whether these phenotypes are linked is currently unknown as is the number of biocide exposures needed to select each phenotype (MDR or loss of fitness) and the genetic basis for each phenotype. This proposal aims to determine exactly how many biocide exposures are needed to generate MDR and loss of fitness. The paradigm for detection of mutations on a global scale has changed recently with the development of next-generation sequencing technology. The genetic basis for MDR will be determined by full genome sequencing of selected biocide-selected mutants. The consequences of specific mutations will be investigated by analysing transcriptomic and PhenoArray data for specific mutants to determine their effect on global gene expression and ability to grow in over 2000 compounds. This will allow a powerful analysis of genome, transcriptome and phenotype for defined mutants. Expected outcomes: An understanding of the mechanisms by which biocides can select antibiotic resistance and an evaluation of whether this is a threat to human health.

This suggests better biocide formulation may minimise selection of resistance. The majority of biocides tested selected for low-level multidrug resistant mutants whilst some selected for mutants with clinically relevant quinolone resistance.

 

We developed a new method which showed that Salmonella can survive exposure to a working concentration of biocides, previously thought to be impossible. Survivors were multidrug resistant efflux mutants.



Gyrase mutants selected after biocide exposure were found to be generically better able to tolerate bactericidal shock by various antimicrobials due to increased expression of stress response genes (thought to be controlled by supercoiling changes). This observation revolutionises our understanding of the impact of gyrase mutation and may help explain the high level and ease of selection of quinolone resistance (a major clinical problem).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work has potential utility for industry - companies involved in making new biocides have shown interest in these results and relationships were developed with Dow, Arch Chemicals, Unilever and New Energy Management. Industrial partners have been interested in the methodology we developed in this grant to identify biocide surviving mutants as well as evaluating novel biocides for propensity to select for antibiotic resistance and development of novel indicator genes that indicate up-regulation of antibiotic resistance genes in response to biocide stress (the basis for a PhD project in collaboration with Unilever and Cardiff University).

The work from this grant (and my David Phillips fellowship) was used as part of the evidence base to change regulation requirements and a new EU wide law (the Biocidal Products Regulation), in force from 2013 requires the potential for biocides to select antibiotic resistance to be analysed before any new biocide will be licenced. This research has identified how biocides can select for antibiotic resistance and dictated that this should be considered when developing new biocides as well as providing new methodologies to achieve this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A8210D10-4640-41A8-A7D6-EE051FA8C4F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3440005214.3633413774f75ba</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Changing European Commission policy in relation to biocides as agents driving antibiotic resistance</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A4FD189-6BFB-44F6-AFAF-F26E271284EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Antibiotic resistance has become one of the great challenges to human health in the 21st century with increasing numbers of isolates of many pathogenic bacteria being resistant to front line, therapeutic antibiotics. Recent evidence has suggested that antibiotic resistance can be selected by exposure to biocides, which are commonly used as disinfectants and preservatives.
Research at the University of Birmingham has shown the common mechanistic links between antibiotic and triclosan (a commonly used biocide) resistance. This research was used by the European Commission as evidence to support two reports published in 2009 and 2010 to inform opinions as to the safety of biocide use. These reports recommended specific new research avenues be funded and that possible selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides is a valid concern and were used as part of the evidence base in preparation of a new law which has come in to force across the European Union. 
Biocide use and sales in Europe have been controlled by the Biocidal Products Directive since 1998. This legislation has been superseded by the EU Biocides Regulation (published May 2012, legally binding from September 2013). This new legislation now includes a requirement for new biocides to be demonstrated not to select resistance to themselves or antibiotics in target organisms before achieving registration; this addition was informed by University of Birmingham research. This will prevent biocides entering the environment that exert a selective pressure and favour the emergence of mutant bacteria with increased biocide and antibiotic resistance. Thus the research described has had an impact on policy debate and the introduction of new legislation.
The research described above by Dr Mark Webber at the University of Birmingham provided a scientific and mechanistic insight into how biocide exposure can select antibiotic resistance, proved that common mechanisms of resistance are relevant to both biocides and antibiotics and that mutants selected after biocide exposure are fit in animal models. The research also identified significant gaps in the current knowledge base regarding the mechanisms by which bacteria respond to biocides and commonalities with response to antibiotics, as well as a dearth of data on biocide tolerance in clinical and environmental isolates of pathogenic species. The impact from these findings was the provision of significant new information for policy makers and opinion leaders to formulate opinions as to the safe use of biocides and recommendations for future research priorities at a European level (1). This report gave a series of recommendations including instigation of research programmes to develop surveillance programmes to identify levels of biocide tolerance, develop standards for testing of the propensity of biocides to select for resistance and to monitor biocide production and environmental accumulation levels.
The research was directly and exclusively quoted in 2010 in the EC Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety 'Preliminary opinion on triclosan': 'the identification of mechanisms of microbial resistance including genomic and proteomic aspects, is commendable and should be extended to other biocides' (2).
The research has not only helped to shape EU opinion but also influenced changes to the law governing the use of biocides. The new 'EU biocides regulation (No 528/2012)' (3) was released in 2012 and became legally binding across the EU from 2013. This includes requirements for any new biocidal product to demonstrate that it does not to select resistance to itself or target organisms before it can be registered and used in any formulations. This legislation supersedes the previous 'Biocidal products directive'. In the UK alone 652 biocidal products are currently licensed under the previous directive, as detailed on the Health and Safety Executive website of licensed biocides (4). The new regulations influenced by this work will apply to at least this number of products in a growing market.
All biocidal products now submitted for regulatory approval required to be allowed to be sold in the European Union must now have been demonstrated not to select resistance to themselves or other antimicrobials, this will prevent biocides being used that provide a selective pressure that can drive antibiotic resistance. Whilst the new legislation has only been legally binding since September 2013 the German federal bureau for risk management (BfR) recommended a ban on triclosan in 2009 (5) in all non-medical contexts, the BfR ruling relied heavily on thea report mentioned above from the EC Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety 'Preliminary opinion on triclosan' to form a basis for its decision which in turn used research from Birmingham to shape its conclusions. The EU in turn imposed a similar ban across Europe in 2010 in response to the BfR recommendation and a petition from Ciba (the manufacturer of triclosan) to remove triclosan from the approved list of biocidal products (this ban was over-ruled in 2012 after appeal from users of triclosan due to procedural problems with the original ruling, further legal consideration is pending at the time of submission).
The work was disseminated by publication in international peer reviewed journals, conference presentations and informal discussion with government agencies e.g. quarterly meetings with colleagues at DEFRA.
