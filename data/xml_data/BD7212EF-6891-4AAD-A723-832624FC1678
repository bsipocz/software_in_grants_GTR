Their collections contain artefacts acquired by British servicemen in colonial warfare and on imperial garrison duties across the globe, variously acquired as trophies, prize, souvenirs, curios and specimens. These artefacts are little known outside the constituency of military history and within their current institutions rarely researched in reference to their complex intercultural biographies. 

Focussing on military campaigns in India and Africa from 1750 to 1900, this project will undertake an interdisciplinary reappraisal of military collections. By tracing collections histories through archival evidence it will both investigate the meaning of non-European artefacts in military organisational culture and their value as material witnesses of encounters between non-European peoples and imperial forces. Research questions include: 

1. What does the pattern of taking, recording and modification of objects tell us about the characteristics of British military collecting in the context of colonial and imperial warfare?

2. How does a more nuanced analysis of the transference of objects in war revise our understanding of colonial and post-colonial relationships? 

3. How did military governance, cultural sanction and contingency work to establish boundaries around the taking and disposal of objects? 

4. How can we address the tensions between the original communal role of these military collections and their contemporary function in public military museums?

The material legacy of non-European military campaigns in military and non-military museums is widespread, yet the systematic understanding of this legacy is virtually absent from the analytical and historical literature. Military collecting offers an under-developed source for critically reappraising the linkages between museum collections and imperial history in the post-colonial period. 

Colonial African and Indian campaigns (estimated as 60-70% of total non-European collections) will be tracked through multiple military museum collections examined in tandem with institutional records, archives, registers, as well as biographies, diaries and photographs related to individual collectors. An in-depth examination of objects and documents will deliver a more multifaceted understanding of military governance, communal military culture and individual agency. The project will highlight hidden histories of taking and retention, going beyond the simplistic view of all such military artefacts as 'loot'. This revisionist approach will allow comparisons across former European imperial powers of a complex and controversial topic. It will enable a critical reassessment of the relevance of these collecting practices and material legacies today. 

The multidisciplinary project team at National Museums Scotland (NMS) will be supported by an academic and museum-based Advisory Board drawn from the fields of visual and museum anthropology, military history, military anthropology and archaeology. Comparative analysis will draw on research from previous pilot projects undertaken on campaigns in Tibet, China, New Zealand and North America. The National Army Museum (NAM), the project partner, also holds extensive collections and has the wider networks (including the Army Museums Ogilby Trust) to assist with the delivery of knowledge exchange workshops and the organisation of the international seminar. 

Outputs will include two knowledge exchange workshops, an international seminar, a special exhibition (National War Museum, National Museums Scotland, Edinburgh), enhanced gallery interpretation (National Army Museum, London; National Museum of Scotland and National War Museum, Edinburgh), community engagement, online features and pdf catalogue information, and 3-4 publications (articles and a book in addition to non-refereed articles).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In rethinking the colonial histories of military campaigns and the perceived sensitivities that arise in connections with these, the project will influence understanding and practice in a range of non-academic contexts. Our non-academic impact strategy includes two knowledge exchange workshops, a special exhibition, contributions to gallery renewal programmes, online information in the shape of pdf catalogues, project updates, features and blogs. In addition we will be reaching museum audiences through public events, community engagement programmes, articles and features in museum based publications, and target media. The Museums' communications teams will provide media support to publicise the project. 

Partnership between National Museums Scotland (NMS) and the National Army Museum (NAM) draws into the ambit of the project a 130 strong network of regimental, corps and service museums in the United Kingdom, their staff and visiting publics and the Army Museums Ogilby Trust. Other Targeted interest groups include the Museums Ethnographers Group and International Committee for Museums of Arms and Military History. 

Key to knowledge exchange will be the workshops hosting staff from regimental museums (up to 40 professional staff over two workshops). The first workshop &amp;quot;Dividing the Spoils: military collecting reconsidered&amp;quot; will introduce the project and ways of understanding a range of non-European material culture. The second workshop &amp;quot;Fearless display: interpreting military collection histories&amp;quot; will look at the research findings, how multiple histories can be displayed, and the potential for community engagement. These workshops will promote understanding and discussion as pathways to influence the public interpretation and professional perception of military collections. They will enable participating museums to deliver their stated objectives of making these collections relevant to diverse audiences and build the knowledge base and curatorial confidence of their staff. 

Central to non-academic impact will be a special exhibition at the National War Museum, NMS, Edinburgh. Reaching a large national and international audience (597,000 visitor p.a.) this will be a vehicle for showcasing research results and will bring the artefacts from regimental, corps and service museums to new audiences in situ and online. There will be a public engagement programme of events and activities, all providing a platform for media profile as well as dissemination and promotion of the project publications. 

At NAM, public impact will be achieved through the planned gallery renewal in the new Discovery gallery, as part of its continuous refreshment programme. Research findings on NMS collections will feed into scheduled renovations of galleries at the National Museum of Scotland and the National War Museum. The infrastructure of public events, community engagement, outreach activities and educational programmes built around these displays will be key to dissemination of the findings and impact.

The project has policy relevance. Souvenir and curio hunting, trophy taking and looting are continuous elements of behaviour in war zones. These practices remain matters of international concern in relation to the loss of cultural heritage, and are live issues for defence establishments in their management and media management of military deployments overseas. The July 2015 Oxford Union debate on reparations to India demonstrated that this history remains a relevant and contested public issue. In light of present policy concerns, an intercultural historiography of imperial era military collecting offers clarity around the complex motivations underlying acquisition and appropriation of objects in conflict and the memorialisation of these conflicts for later generations. Addressing these issues will be a principal strand of the international seminar which will feature participants with relevant military operational command experience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-07-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>390294</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006752/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
