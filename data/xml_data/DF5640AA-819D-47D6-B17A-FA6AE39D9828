Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K000632/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Epidemiological and psychobiological studies indicate that promoting adolescent wellbeing can powerfully mediate the effects of stress and psychosocial adversity on health and economic outcomes. Improving adolescent wellbeing in the UK is now a national priority with urgent calls for evidence-based, whole school interventions that help all young people to develop habits of mind and behaviour to build resilience and flourish emotionally.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mindfulness is an attention-based practice which promotes awareness and regulation of one's thoughts and feelings. Substantial evidence indicates that mindfulness based approaches (MBA) promote wellbeing among adults and exploratory studies suggest they may be effective for young people. Prior to effectiveness trials, this project will deepen understanding the implementation context for (hard-to-reach) young people in schools.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This creative, user-led project will build a collective understanding with users and stakeholders to explore if, and how, MBA can be implemented in schools. With a young person?s steering group, the project will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>identify user and stakeholder priorities&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>explore organisational and policy influences and develop routes to impact&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>host an art exhibition to represent adolescent wellbeing and stress&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deliver a workshop for users and stakeholders&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>host a national conference&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>establish international knowledge exchange mechanisms to sustain partnerships beyond the life of the project. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries of this work are young people (11-18 years), school communities (teachers, head teachers, classroom assistants, pastoral teams), a local council (Children and Educational Psychology services), the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), policymakers, the co-funding charity and researchers in mindfulness and whole school approaches to wellbeing.
1. Young people will benefit in diverse ways. Fifteen young people (15-18yrs) will form the project's Apprentice Research Team. They will: receiving training in committee roles and user involvement; be offered mindfulness training and practice; be invited to university events including research open days; with undergraduates acting as mentors; learn about MBA, engage with researchers and stakeholders, and inform the creative aspects of the project (e.g. documentary, website, exhibition and pod/vodcasts). We hope to excite this group of young people about research, raise their aspirations and hope they will benefit from seeing the ways in which they can use and shape research. A separate constituency of young people who practice mindfulness will be invited to communicate their experiences on the project website; we know of young people from the UK, USA, Germany and Egypt who are keen to do this. Such contributions will engage a global community of young people in dialogue about well-being and MBA. A third group of young people (11-18 yrs) who live locally to the project, will have the opportunity to contribute representations of wellbeing and stress at a multi-media exhibition. This group will benefit from having their artistic skills recognised and rewarded and from opportunities to work with Leeds Metropolitan Schools of Art and a graffiti artist; with permission, work would be hosted on the project website whose global reach will expand the pool of beneficiaries and promote international dissemination and user engagement.
2. Council services for young people (Children's Services and Educational Psychology Services), head teachers and other school staff will benefit by learning about MBA and links to wellbeing, and its potential fit with SEAL. These stakeholders will benefit by shaping knowledge on how MBA could be implemented in schools, thus sensitising future research to the needs of their organisations, schools, curriculum, classrooms and pupils. It may help to inform strategic objectives for council services who commission school programmes. Partnerships cemented during the project are likely to be deployed in future research, with opportunities for involvement in RCTs of the effectiveness of MBA in schools. The project website will have a knowledge back and resources for different users and will reach beneficiaries not directly involved in the project. The DVD will disseminate knowledge about implementing MBA to multiple users and stakeholders.
3.Policy makers will benefit from understanding and shaping the potential of MBA for promoting wellbeing. The Children and Young People's (CYP) Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Project (part of CAMHS) who are exploring new, evidence-based practices which can meet the mental health needs of young people will benefit , as well as the Mental Health Foundation who aim to support mindfulness for all. 
4.The co-funding charity will benefit from the project as it meets one of their strategic objectives to invest in national and international mindfulness research. 
5. Researchers will benefit from the establishment of an International Network for Mindfulness in Schools, from improved potential for later uptake of their research and international partnership, optimising the potential for future R &amp;amp; D investment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Biomedical Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>White Rose Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>72DECC49-1AC3-4782-B695-CD8ABC3452AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The consortium is multi-disciplinary and involves psychology (Leeds), clinical psychology (Sheffield), and education (York).

The project was successful in engaging stakeholders, both through one-to-one meetings (e.g with head-teachers), in sustained small group meetings (e.g. with teenagers) and in large consultations (e.g. with mental health and educational service representatives). We were able to build understanding of the potential of mindfulness in schools for these different groups and identified the priorities of next stage research as well how the work could inform policies around mental health support for young people. The work evolved by first building collaborations with local secondary schools, then via these, establishing relationships with groups of young people so that we could work effectively together, before making contact with key people in local education and mental health services. By consistently running events that were tailored to the interests of different stakeholders, we slowly built local interest and support for research in this area. In consultations with services, we listened carefully to their priorities, concerns and ways of working, and quickly began refining research plans to show that their input was influencing our practice. We then extended our reach and hosted an international conference to both learn from oversees work as well as to publicise the work in the UK. This international reach supported local reach, as there was representation of local schools and services at this conference, and exposure to the global approaches to mindfulness in education was inspiring.

The project outputs have been used primarily to shape next stage research. Both education and mental health services strongly advocated establishing a robust evidence base for the potential of mindfulness in schools. The project was the platform from which a White Rose Consortium was developed. Through this forum, the findings have informed the development of two grant applications, in collaboration with local council and local schools. Findings of the project were also submitted to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Wellbeing Economics, where they considered the role of mindfulness in education. The evidence base presented there contributed to the establishment of an All Party Parliamentary Group on Mindfulness in the UK. Locally, the relationships we established both with mental health services and charities has led to an invitation to contribute material on mindfulness to a new portal to mental health support for teenagers in Leeds.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DF83E880-5126-4FF0-8D58-96517AD2014B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463410ccea188.28233267</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to disseminate research on mindfulness and to build understanding of how to design and implement next stage research in ways that aligned with guidelines on complex trials and which were relevant to end users.

Key findings were that:
 - UK inner city secondary school staff and pupils and key departments relevant to children's services reported a significant need for whole school interventions to promote well-being and readiness to learn among young people. 
 - young people themselves were open to mindfulness and saw its relevance to managing stress, negative thoughts and attitudes, and interpersonal relationships. They demonstrated reasonable buy-in to a model of self-care to minimise risk of poor mental health now and later in adulthood, although there were developmental differences in understanding and appreciating the importance of preventative approaches to mental health. Some pupils found some aspects of mindfulness conceptually difficult. 
- secondary school management teams (SMTs) were broadly interested in the potential impact of mindfulness practice on attainment, attendance and behaviour. Some schools place pupil social and emotional well-being high on the agenda and were interested in how mindfulness would impact emotional regulation and readiness to learn. Whether mindfulness could reduce self-harm, substance abuse and vulnerability to sexual exploitation was of importance to some schools. Pre-service and in-service teacher access to mindfulness programmes to prevent stress and burnout were also recommended. 
- Children's Services, the Complex Needs Service and Public Health Services of Leeds City Council were motivated to see mindfulness programmes trialled in schools, and suggested ways in which it would complement existing universal and targeted services. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and schools' capacity to cope with mental health of young people is under strain. Local services emphasised the importance of support from SMTs, the need for non-stigmatising and whole school approaches to promote positive mental health.

Across the project, there was overwhelming support from stakeholders for (a) a cascading, whole school approach regardless of mode of delivery, and (b) teachers having access to mindfulness programmes. 

Schools and services named the following as preferred primary outcomes in future research: emotional well-being, emotional literacy, staff stress, pupil behaviour, resilience, self-control, attainment, attendance, and pupil anxiety. Years 7 and 11 were identified as important starting points for a next stage trial.

Reported challenges are that:
(i) mindfulness is not a quick fix nor a fix-all programme, and there is a danger of its usefulness being subverted by rushed or partial implementation. Identifying the impact of mindfulness on pupils and teachers requires a commitment to longitudinal research.
(ii) there is a risk of mindfulness programmes being misused by some schools to seek outcomes for which there is currently little direct evidence (e.g. attainment).
(iii) it can be difficult to give pupils choice in whole school approaches.
(iv) some schools do not view pupil well-being as important in academic attainment. 
(v) there is currently insufficient accountability on schools to show a non-stigmatising approach to supporting pupil and teacher mental health.
(vi) little is known about the most effective ways to secure parental support and whether this is crucial to good outcomes from mindfulness programs 
(vii) well-being is often not a strategic priority and local services often need to invest in responsive rather than preventative approaches.
(viii) the ideal mindfulness program template has yet to be defined - return on investment is difficult to identify given multiple modes of delivery and dosage.
(ix) it is as yet unclear how to most effectively and appropriately build on existing international programs and evidence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings might be useful to :
- schools and school / child based services, in determining whether mindfulness programmes may be a suitable intervention for their community and for which outcomes.
- programme / intervention developers, in developing a whole school approach which targets the preferred outcomes of stakeholders.
- researchers, in knowing that schools have a preferred implementation for mindfulness programmes. A large trial is needed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of whole school mindfulness programmes, and for different outcomes around readiness to learn and mental health. 
-policy makers, in understanding the needs of schools around the mental well-being of staff and pupils, in appreciating the acceptability of mindfulness programmes to these communities, and to support ongoing implementation of research of such programmes in schools. The findings also support the case for a new national survey of mental well-being among children and adolescents.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>021D884C-8F51-4001-82B4-00665416897A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a5cedc9d595.94273917</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/info/1318/leeds_mindfulness_research_group/340/mindfulness_in_schools_project</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K000632/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
