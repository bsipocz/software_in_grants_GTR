Building on a currently-funded Welsh Government grant to pilot the use of an array of cosmic detectors in schools across South Wales (which began in Jan. 2016), this project will:

* Develop and provide a range of educational resources based upon particle physics and linked to the Physics curriculum in schools (WJEC in Wales). This will include paper-based resources, interactive resources and also a roadshow for schools-based workshops

* Work with scientists involved in this area of STFC science to gather advice on the current state of this research, and also to help them disseminate their work to a wider audience

* Develop and maintain a website which will both act as a repository of the resources for using the detectors in the classroom, but also as a collaborative learning space where schools can upload their data and work together to analyse their results

* Develop and run a teacher CPD programme for teachers across Wales to come and learn about particle physics research and how they can become involved in the QuarkNet Cymru project

* Train undergraduate and postgraduate students from Cardiff and Swansea Universities in science communication and the contents of the QuarkNet Cymru programme, so that they can help deliver the programme in local schools, act as role models for the school students, and also aid the teachers with the practical aspects of the project

* Develop a particle physics equipment 'loan scheme' where schools from across Wales can apply to borrow smaller items of kit which can be used for experiments in their classrooms.

This project will be the first of its kind in Wales, building on an existing STEM programme, HiSparc/QuarkNet, operated by the University of Birmingham (with Bristol, Bath and Glasgow).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Results will be disseminated through various means, including the relevant university/STFC press offices (local news stories about the events, workshops etc.), and in particular any scientific research work that project participants contribute to. We will also write articles for relevant STEM education journals (e.g. IoP, ASE and IAU). 

We will promote this project through various mechanisms, targeting local, regional and UK-wide STEM bodies that allow information on the project to be delivered direct to target audiences (primarily schools). This will be done through direct contact with education authorities (via university Marketing depts. etc.), teachers and schools on e.g. the FTP user database, and through our extensive personal contacts and networks. Roberts and Roche have many existing networks and connections with relevant STEM educational bodies that will ensure the project is broadly publicised to both formal and informal education sectors.

Both FTP and Space Made Simple have extensive contact lists of schools with whom they have previously worked, and will be able to promote the project through this and associated social media accounts. The FTP and Space Made Simple teams already make extensive use of social media (notably Facebook and Twitter), and relevant STEM forums such as PTNC. These provide additional routes to engage with teachers in particular. The team have many contacts in STEM education across the UK, and anticipate that other education partners may become involved across Wales, and nationally through the existing HiSparc work being carried out by university staff in Birmingham, Bristol, Bath and Glasgow.

We will work with relevant professional bodies across the UK (e.g. ASE, IoP, ESERO-UK and several Royal Societies), looking for opportunities to expand the programme in future. We have extensive contacts within various bodies associated with teacher training, and would be able to deliver CPD sessions to PGCE science students in Cardiff Met, Swansea Met, Swansea and Aberystwyth universities.

In particular, we will be working with the Welsh Assembly Government's National Science Academy (NSA) programme, which has funded the hardware for the large QuarkNet Cymru project. Through the NSA (directly into the Dept. of Education and Skills), we will have contact with schools throughout Wales, and also with other STEM education programmes that they fund (e.g. the IoP Lab in a Lorry). This ensures we can communicate with the relevant teachers and other educators who might be able to further publicise or participate within the programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P001483/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
