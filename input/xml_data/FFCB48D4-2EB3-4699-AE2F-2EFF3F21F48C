This is achieved by the directed guidance of neuronal processes along highly specific pathways, which are laid down by chemical cues. Mistakes made during axon pathfinding from the eye to the brain, for example as a result of loss of eye pigmentation in albinism, result in an impaired ability to see in depth. Moreover, defects in axon pathfinding within the brain have been linked to the development of disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Understanding how brain and eye connections form normally may also help devise novel strategies for nerve regeneration following injury or damage to the adult nervous system, for example following optic nerve damage or stroke. Recently, we discovered that a molecule best characterised as a growth factor for blood vessels, which is known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), affects nerve wiring between the eye and brain. Specifically, we found that VEGF-A is essential for the routing of nerve processes that extend from each eye into the opposite brain hemisphere to help us see objects in depth. More recently, we discovered that a related molecule called VEGF-C also affects nerve wiring between the eye and brain. We now seek funding to determine the precise role of VEGF-C in this process, to investigate how VEGF-A and VEGF-C cooperate in establishing the wiring that is necessary for normal vision, and to establish how their signals are transmitted within the nerve cables. This research will advance our understanding of normal brain wiring and, in the future, will likely advance the development of clinical therapies that promote repair and regeneration following damage to the eye and its brain targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at the optic chiasm into contralateral and ipsilateral projections is a process essential for stereovision and an excellent model system to investigate axon guidance decisions. We have demonstrated recently that the VEGF164 isoform of the classical angiogenic factor VEGF-A binds its receptor neuropilin 1 (NRP1) on RGC axons destined for the contralateral optic tract to help them cross the optic chiasm. Our pilot data suggest that a related molecule known best for its function in the lymphatic vasculature, VEGF-C, also directly regulates axon guidance at the chiasm midline. We now wish to extend these findings to identify the precise role of VEGF-C and its main receptor, VEGFR3 at the optic chiasm and to establish if co-operative interactions between VEGF-A and VEGF-C are important for establishing stereovision. We further wish to understand how NRP1 transmits the VEGF-A signals that control RGC axon guidance. We already know from our pilot experiments that NRP1 requires a co-receptor to transmit VEGF-A signals in RGCs and that this co-receptor is neither of the classical vascular VEGF-A receptors, VEGFR1 or VEGFR2. We will use a combination of expression, genetic, functional and biochemical assays to identify the NRP1 interacting protein(s) that convey VEGF-A signals in RGCs. The proposed programme of work will advance significantly our understanding of the mechanisms that establish stereovision and provide fundamental information on the role of classical vascular factors in neural circuit formation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will significantly enhance our knowledge of the developmental processes that establish functional brain wiring patterns. Beyond their interest to the academic community, the results will impact on several other identifiable beneficiaries:

Commercial private sector: Because this work will identify novel functions and signalling pathways of VEGF family proteins in neurons, the results are likely to be of interest to the commercial sector involved in developing novel therapeutics for patients with neurodegenerative disorders or neurological injury, as they may be able to capitalise on this new knowledge. For example, companies marketing VEGF-A therapies for other purposes may consider that VEGF-A therapies have new applications in regenerative medicine, or identify VEGF-C as a new commercial target. Accordingly, this project is likely to contribute new knowledge that will lead to more translational research in the medium term, and may benefit regenerative and repair medicine to impact positively on public health in the UK and abroad in the long term. The fields of neurodegenerative disorders and neurological trauma in particular are areas of unmet clinical need with high social and economic importance.

Public: An immediate impact of this project is its opportunity to raise awareness and understanding of science and research through public dissemination of novel findings and explaining their significance. Knowledge of the developmental processes sculpting normal brain and eye development is key to understanding how we carry out everyday tasks, such as those that involve sight, sound, smell, learning and memory, etc. Studies of the mechanisms controlling axon growth and pathfinding will also improve the public's understanding of the origins of neurodevelopmental disorders that have been linked to deficits in brain wiring patterns. These topics will be incorporated in outreach activities to engage with the public about this work. 

UK and International Research Base: By endowing researchers with both project specific and transferable skills, this project will lead to highly skilled workers that will benefit the UK's economic competitiveness. The project will also lead to new international collaborations and therefore enhance knowledge transfer and increase the international profile of our Universities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146840</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Medical Sciences Aberdeen</gtr:department><gtr:description>Commissural axon guidance</gtr:description><gtr:id>4B4FC75D-40D9-45FF-9F8A-96B29BB181DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A manuscript has been published in the prestigious journal Neuron, a follow up manuscript was published in Development and a manuscript is currently in preparation for submission to a neuroscience journal.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>CqyaUyq5kKG-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators analyse the research materials we provide and contribute to manuscript writing.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration resulted in joint successful grant applications, initially to the Wellcome Trust, then to the BBSRC, both times with funding for my lab (technical support) and funding for the collaborating lab (postdoc).

Specifically we have:
1. Identified which of the different forms of VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor-A) are sufficient for VEGF-A signalling in neurons. Whilst it was already known that VEGF164 can act directly on neurons to promote normal development, we now identified a role for VEGF188 that had not been demonstrated previously. This work has been published. This work is important, as VEGF188 binds more tightly to tissue than VEGF164 and might therefore be a more suitable therapeutic reagent for use in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering strategies. 
2. Demonstrated that VEGF-A receptor neuropilin-1 is required autonomously in retinal neurons for the normal development of the optic pathway. Together with our previous work, this finding provides direct evidence that the classical angiogenic factor VEGF-A can act directly on neurons to sculpt brain-wiring patterns. A manuscript describing these findings is in preparation.
3. Demonstrated that VEGF-A indirectly affects brain-wiring patters through its role in orchestrating vascular patterns in the brain. This work has advanced our understanding of the mechanisms that control vessel ingression into the developing brain. Moreover, by providing novel insights into the interactions between nerves and vessels during normal development, our work may help advance the development of more effective regenerative strategies. A manuscript describing these findings is in preparation.
4. Investigated the importance of another VEGF family member termed VEGF-C for normal brain development. We have found that VEGF-C in combination with VEGF-A is important for normal axon patterning and morphology of the developing brain. The finding that VEGF-C in combination with VEGF-A is essential for normal development of brain structure was unexpected, and we have established a collaboration with Dr Jean-Leon Thomas at Yale University, an expert on VEGF-C signalling in neural stem cells, to further investigate this novel finding.
5. Investigated the signalling mechanisms of VEGF-A in neurons. Our previous work had demonstrated that the mechanisms underlying VEGF-A signalling in neurons are distinct from endothelial cells. We also had shown that the VEGF-A receptor neuropilin-1 is essential for VEGF-A signalling in retinal axons and that neuropilin-1 requires a co-receptor for VEGF-A signalling in these cells. We have screened a range of potential co-receptors for neuropilin-1 and identified several possible candidates that we are now validating. We also have identified potential downstream targets of neuropilin-1 that are essential for VEGF-A-dependent patterning of neuronal connections, which we also are now validating. Through identifying the differences in signalling mechanisms of VEGF-A in neurons versus endothelial cells this work may aid in the development of pro- and anti-VEGF-A therapies that can be targeted to these distinct cell types. A grant application is now in preparation to continue this work.

In summary, work funded by this grant has allowed us to publish one manuscript, with several additional manuscripts in the pipeline. We also have published several review articles, presented this work at conferences and participated in a number of public engagement events to disseminate out findings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of potential beneficiaries of this work:
1. Our findings will be a broad interest to academics working in the fields of axon guidance, VEGF signalling in the nervous system, vascular development and regenerative medicine and may be used by researchers in these and other fields to drive their work forward.
2. Our findings will be of interest to the lay public and may be used to generate greater understanding of normal brain development, in particular the importance of interactions between developing nerves and vessels for establishment of normal brain structure and function. 
3. As outlined above, our finding may be, in the long run, be utilised by the commercial sector to aid in development of novel or more effective therapeutics and tissue engineering strategies for patients with neurodegenerative disorders or neurological injuries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C118BE48-2CEC-4E07-82BB-F6581BECE0D0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a4c3342ac97.17933256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have characterised a new knockin mouse that specifically targets retinal ganglion cell neurons in the retina and a few other selected neuronal subtypes in the brain.
