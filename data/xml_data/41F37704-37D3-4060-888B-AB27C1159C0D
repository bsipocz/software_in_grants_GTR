Since Roman cities subsequently became central to the character of Rome's imperial system, understanding the earliest development of towns in Italy at this period is central to any comprehension of Roman imperialism itself. However, the earliest phases of these cities, many of which have continued in occupation until today, lie deeply buried beneath later structures. This innovative project will deploy Ground-Penetrating Radar (henceforth GPR) survey alongside the study of ceramic assemblages across the full extent of two cities founded in this period - Interamna Lirenas founded as a colony in 312 BC and Falerii Novi founded by Rome in 241 BC (following Rome's razing of Falerii Veteres) to characterise their early development. Both sites were abandoned in the post-Roman period and now lie beneath agricultural land, hence they are available for total survey. The work will build directly upon our previous survey at both sites (which has included full magnetometry and topographical surveys of both) to provide unique new data about the deeply buried deposits thereby allowing the integrated information to be used to map these towns and address key questions about the nature of Roman urban development in this key period. 
 
The two sites have been selected for further study in this project partly because of previous work which serves as a control on, and as a complement to the planned GPR survey, but also because past study of these contrasting sites has clarified the specific questions that need to be answered in order to understand the primary phases of their urban development: 
1. the scale, the nature and extent of their primary planned grids (and its relationship to the town walls at Falerii Novi)
2. the nature and extent of settlement surrounding the grid-planned areas
3. the organization of domestic space, 
4. the character, role and nature of the public monuments
5. the role of local, Italic, and Greek influences on these elements of their planning 

In collaboration with the University of Ghent, our project will first collect close interval GPR data across the available areas of both sites, processing the results to provide 'time slice' plans of the structures at successive depths below the surface. GPR has recently been developed as a reliable method for collecting data on buried sites at high resolution and the computer software for the processing of these data (eg. GPR-Slice) is now excellent, enabling plans at different depths below the surface to be generated reliably. The deployment of this technology on a city-wide scale will place our project at the cutting edge of such research worldwide, thereby contributing the development of archaeological survey methodology.
Second we will use existing excavated pottery from past work at Falerii Novi and collect new samples from systematic shovel testing pits across the site at Interamna Lirenas in order to provide tighter chronological information about the rate of development of the two cities. In the latter we will sieve a sample from each topsoil test pit. The pottery from these samples will provide a sound understanding of the spatial and chronological development of the town. Such work is now possible here (uniquely in Italy) because of the detailed study of coarse pottery that has already been undertaken in the context of our current work at the site.
Third, we will integrate these results with those from our previous surveys to develop models for the spatial structure and chronological development of the two cites. Further, these models will be discussed in the broader context of Mediterranean urban development.
Finally, the results will be used to help support education and tourist development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are three principal audiences: 
 
The Public with an interest in archaeology
We will seek coverage through articles in magazines (such as Current World Archaeology and Archeologia Viva) providing links to our academic publications and website. We will also use press coverage when possible. To reach a broader public with interests in related fields like urban history and Roman history we will address audiences for instance through presentations at the Cambridge University Festival of Ideas (attended by more than 15,000 people last year) and through CRASSH (Cambridge's Centre for Research in Arts Social Sciences and Humanities) and other such media. We will also take opportunities as they arise to give talks and make presentations to local archaeological societies in the UK and Italy.

Heritage Managers and Planners
Our work has enormous implications for those responsible for managing the archaeological heritage and for planners in local, regional and national government. They require better information about buried sites in order both to manage the historical resource and to mitigate the impact of infrastructure development. Our work will demonstrate how their ability to understand buried remains can be improved. By enhancing information through remote sensing - without excavation - we will help improve methods for heritage management. Equally, we can contribute to developing methods through which buried remains away from known and protected sites are detected and understood, thus mitigating the problems faced in planning infrastructure development. 
We will address this group towards the end of the project with our case studies. We will run a one day conference in collaboration with the British School at Rome and in partnership with ICCROM (UNESCO's International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property). The strategy will be to provide a high level overview of the importance of our work for heritage managers and planners. We will link this to our website and also seek to engage such bodies as the Royal Town Planning Institute during the course of our work so that we can open up the implications of our work to the planning community more broadly, gaining publicity through their website and newsletters.

Local Communities
Near the two sites we already have a substantial foundation for impact and our work is done in collaboration with the Soprintendenza. 
At Interamna Lirenas, we have a partnership with the Comune of Pignataro Interamna who will continue to support the work by providing a former school-house as our work base. They are interested in (a) the development of the site as a heritage attraction, and (b) its greater use as an educational resource. We will work with them on this, contributing to their plans, giving both formal and informal tours and talks to the community, local schools etc., and maintaining a profile for the work through the local press and broadcast media. We will help provide leaflets and design sign-boards to explain the topography of the buried town to inhabitants and visitors.
At Falerii Novi the management of the site by the Soprintendenza faces challenges as a result of social and developmental pressures. We will build on contacts with the Comune of Fabrica di Roma to develop a strong relationship like that at Interamna. Sign-boards on the site already reflect our past survey work and we will seek to have these updated in the light of our new research whilst also providing leaflets about our results.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>227373</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Joint Chapter Meeting of Computer Apllications in Archaeology group - Netherlands/Flanders and Germany</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E703AC4C-D8EF-4753-9DAC-6BE2F41854B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk on georadar survey at two urban sites in Italy</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589b0c79885e96.88579051</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.caanlfl.nl/?q=node/51</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;The Archaeology of Mediterranean Consumption&quot; (Freie Universit?t Berlin, 30 Ocotber 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4EE2429-3614-4C91-B490-89A07716EA33</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk by Dr Launaro on project at Interamna</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589b0e5b84ce85.64392783</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Mediterranean Survey Workshop, Palermo, 2-3.12.2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>79FCF4F2-555A-4B52-A27E-3085A24C2BAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented to academic meeting -
