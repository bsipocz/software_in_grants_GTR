(1) to introduce and test new methods of finding statistical solutions based on
a simple application of symbolic calculus, to be followed by a comparison with
numerics,

(2) to carry out a detailed study of hypoviscous fluid equations with critical blowup
criteria and to asssess the effects of non-locality on the characteristics of turbulence by direct
numerical simulations of turbulence with finite energy.

*Motivations

The problem of fluid turbulence deals with phenomena ubiquitous in our daily
life, yet its complete understanding, let alone its control, is way far beyond
our current capability. Turbulence is also regarded as a big open problem in
classical physics. While a suitable description of turbulence should be
inevitably statistical in nature, a satisfactory theory has not yet been developed.

Even for deterministic solutions of the fluid dynamical equations,
there is still room for smooth solutions to break down. Such a potential blow up is
connected with statistical solutions, as it can trigger a transition from
deterministic to statistical descriptions.

*Strategy

(1) A complete statistical description of the Navier-Stokes turbulence is
given by the Hopf characteristic functional, which satisfies the celebrated
Hopf functional differential equation (FDE).
In spite of previous attempts, it remains difficult to find a method of its solutions.
Recently, the PI has discovered a method of converting the FDE into a
functional integral equation, thereby generating a systematic approximation
series. The method lies in the introduction of an exponential operator with
a functional derivative as its exponent. Our aim is to put the approximation
into practice.

Another key is use of first integrals method developed by Vishik and
Fursikov in 70's. It resolves the notorious unclosedness of turbulence
statistics. Its proper understanding, as yet obtained, provides a practical
way of handling Hopf equation.

(2) The Navier-Stokes equations satisfy invariance under scaling transforms.
Recently, it has been proven that some critical norms serve as blowup criteria,
i.e. they become unbounded upon formation of singularities. Hence showing
how difficult it is to have unbounded critical norms, theoretically and
numerically, will be a promising way to improve our understanding the
Navier-Stokes regularity.

We will also carry out direct numerical simulations of turbulence in the whole space
and compare the results with those of periodic boundary conditions.

*Benefits
Both topics will find applications in physical or engineering areas,
because they are related with statistics of turbulence and (near-)singular
structures.

Techniques of operational calculus will prove helpful to the general audience
to make Differential Equations approachable. We will prepare a documentation
on the methods in the spirit of the British tradition and make freely available
on the web, while gathering queries from the public audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>&amp;gt;Who might benefit from this research ?
&amp;gt;How might they benefit from this research ?

(1) The beneficiaries of this research will be researchers working on
fluid mechanics, i.e. applied mathematicians, physicists and engineers.

(2) The other beneficiaries will be school teachers and students
in public sector, who are the audience of the web pages that
PI maintains for introducing 'Differential Equations' on the basis
of operational calculus.

For (1):
The outputs of the research will be published in a timely fashion
on the archive and in quality journals devoted to research in applied
mathematics.

Specialized seminars will be the events where the results are aimed at
a target audience. Interested research students and postdocs in Sheffield will have 
direct access to the expertise which we will bring to the institution.

The PDRA will receive appropriate mentoring and advice, including on publication
strategy and career development.The direct impact is through the training of
the PDRA in specialized research methods and the literature of the area. This is
part of the process of maintaining mathematical capability, both for research
itself and teaching future users of mathematics.

New algorithms and/or computer source codes will be developed.

For (2):
Outside the academia, not many people are familiar with Differential Equations (DEs).
It would be excellent if they have a feel about them at least partially.
For those who know something about elementary functions, symbolic treatments
can give a friendly introduction.

Because the symbolic method is an important element of this project for
studying statistics of turbulence, it makes sense to collect worked examples
and applications which have been scattered over literature and compile
an introductory documentation on Differential Equations on the web.
We will make it bi-directional by responding to queries by email.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>312976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>If things look identical when zoomed in, we say that they have self-similarity. In connection with the study of &amp;quot;critical dissipativity&amp;quot; we have introduced a new kind of scale-invariance for the fluid dynamical equations, which we call near-invariance (or quasi-invariance) under dynamic scaling. This was achieved for the deterministic equations and it imposes a new constraint on possible singularity formation in turbulent flows. It results from a novel combination of theory of partial differential equations and stochastic analysis.
We have also identified a statistical counterpart of the concept and efforts are being made to clarify the implications it entails.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The method converts the fluid equations into a heat diffusion equation with a potential term. Numerical evaluation of the potential term will be used to identity (near-)singular structure in turbulent flows in computational fluid dynamics. Also, the finding offers mathematical analysis or theoretical physics a new route to approach the basic issues of the Navier-Stokes equations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3F173D02-1990-4DB7-A4A5-A2AF27EB8A28</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b83f6d3084c2.59754289</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
