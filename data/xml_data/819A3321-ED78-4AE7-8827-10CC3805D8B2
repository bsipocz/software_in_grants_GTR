The applicant's expertise is in the identification and characterisation of ecosystem cultural services, and understanding the conceptual bases of the ecosystem services approach. She has a first class honours degree in business organisation, and knowledge of rural land use from her PhD case-study (submitted May 2012) which focused on a restored (multi-habitat) quarry. This experience, in combination with the input of the MPA and RSPB,will enable a full exploration of the potential regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services of restored quarries. The applicant is experienced in qualitative research, and will be able to apply her experience of interviewing, and the analysis of policy,ecological and planning documents to fulfil the study objectives.
This collaboration will add value to the partners by meeting needs expressed in key organisational documents, and by allowing them to adapt to new social,economic and regulatory environments. It will highlight areas where more information is needed to successfully adopt an ecosystem services approach for quarry restoration. It will provide evidence to allow the MPA to make an informed decision on whether to invest further in research to promote an ecosystem services approach to quarry restoration. The MPA will also be provided with material to disseminate and promote the appropriate implementation of an ecosystem service approach to member firms. The project will provide the RSPB with evidence on which to base future funding applications, to enable them to expand their provision of restoration expertise to minerals industry businesses. The collaboration will also help develop the applicant as an independent researcher, who can apply her theoretical knowledge of ecosystem services to an industry specific situation. It will improve the applicant's knowledge of new markets for ecosystem services. The interactions with industry representatives will also develop her profession network and inter-personal skills.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16779</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Internship outputs were consolidated into an eighty page report (for minerals companies, minerals planning authorities, NGOs and policymakers) which outlined and provided practical guidance for how to introduce an ecosystem services into quarry restoration. The MPA is currently developing a database to enable quantification of UK priority habitat creation through quarry management and restoration, and is considering how best to take the ecosystem services approach forward. A joint workshop with the EU funded ?Restore? project and an academic paper (aimed at a high impact planning/ policy journal) have been discussed.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9A826338-0A51-40DB-9309-78BCD49C9D03</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544faef87acef0.43047080</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There are an abundance of ways that the minerals industry could embrace an ecosystem services approach to quarry restoration. It could be applied at either the planning application, ecological restoration or site maintenance phases. Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes may assist with long-term maintenance costs of sites. Using the ecosystem services framework would help the industry identify and communicate social benefits created through quarry restoration in addition to conservation benefits. This would counteract negative of mineral extraction, and help add value to the sector.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Recommendations included that the Mineral Products Association and Nature After Minerals projects consider:

?Developing a ?habitat creation? database (of restored quarries) to enable future ecosystem services (ES) value transfer studies.
?Developing an ES classification and appraisal guide to allow rapid assessment in minerals contexts
?Companies should integrate ES into planning applications to identify local ES priorities, enhance stakeholder engagement, and set-up Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes.
?The industry should undertake a full assessment of potential market opportunities and risks.
?They could develop links to other ES programmes and databases such as RESTORE, UK NEA, BESS, TESSA, AIRES, or InVEST.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>92F6F077-0D6E-4C9B-8EEC-CFBBAD632BC6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fae5ab7de88.41732267</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.valuing-nature.net/news/2013/ecosystem-services-approach-quarry-restoration</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K501372/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
