Whereas the latter rested on the control and engineering of macroscopic objects the new revolution will require the understanding and control of the nanoworld. Controlling nanocomponents lies at the heart of, for example, the clean harnessing of solar energy, the development of smart materials, and the realisation of entirely new concepts in computing. Thus, nanoscience and nanotechnology are buzzwords that are as rife on the academic campus as they are in industrial research laboratories. However, research in nanoscience and nanotechnology has been accompanied by public concerns and much debate has ensued. This debate is necessary and important but it has all but drowned out the sheer excitement, adventure and creativity of probing, understanding and, ultimately, controlling the nanoworld. This project will create an exhibition and public dialogue events that will introduce some of the most interesting and important concepts that drive the nanoworld to the public in a highly accessible and attractive way.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-08-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>134984</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch of book ' NANOSCIENCE Giants of the Infinitesimal' By Peter Forbes and Tom Grimsey, 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7C466763-348B-4900-B38B-5B2BCA40856B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Book Launch of &amp;quot;NANOSCIENCE: Giants of the Infinitesimal&amp;quot; By Peter Forbes and Tom Grimsey, 2014

Creation of an Interactive Exhibition on Nanoscience entitled Giants of the Infinitesimal, which exhibited at The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) and the Magna Centre, Sheffield. The hands-on exhibition arose from a very productive interaction between scientists and artists and enabled the Nanoworld and state-of-the-art concepts in nanoscience to be explained to schoolchildren and the general public. In particular, the role of nanoscience in existing and future technologies was communicated to the general audience. Both exhibitions reached large audiences.

As further advancement of this work, Artist Tom Grimsey collaborated with science writer, Peter Forbes, to produce a book entitled Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal, Papadakis 2014 
ISBN 9781906506230. This book uses simple language and beautiful illustrations to make the subject accessible to the general public. Reviews of the book are quoted below:

Beauty in the detail: Stunning nanoscale images reveal incredible patterns that can be created by playing with cells, crystals and DNA. From the iridescence of butterfly wings to the intricacies of plankton, studying nature on a nanoscale could help scientists create machines as small as those inside a living cell.
Now a new book, the 'Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal', has selected some of the best images from the field to reveal how nature's hidden beauty could be replicated by humans.
The images chart how nanoscience has progressed over the past 50 years showing iconic research such as the smiley faces made from DNA and muscle cells of beef developed from stem cells.

Professor Mark Miodownik
&amp;quot;Many have tried and failed to write engaging and compelling books about nanotechnology. Forbes and Grimsey succeed because they take the reader on a tour of the highlights, and in their company it is like visiting an exquisite grotto: compelling, mysterious and extremely beautiful. If you don't come away from this book feeling intellectually exhilarated, then you need to stay in more&amp;quot;
Professor Mark Miodownik, author of Stuff Matters and regular contributor to BBC2's Science Club.

Physics World
'The nano world can be stunningly beautiful, and NanoScience: Giants of the Infinitesimal demonstrates this with more than 100 gorgeous images drawn from research across the discipline ... a good overview of the work that individual nano scientists are doing to explore this tiny, mesmerisingly beautiful world.'
Physics World

Chemistry World
Any practising scientist or engineer, or a student of those subjects, should find this book inspiring because it brings together the latest achievements in the field, creating a real sense of the direction this research is taking. Furthermore, the authors often make interesting and sometimes surprising links between seemingly unconnected topics (for example, soap bubbles, zeolites and living cells) that may help to stimulate the readers to think outside the box in their own research.
