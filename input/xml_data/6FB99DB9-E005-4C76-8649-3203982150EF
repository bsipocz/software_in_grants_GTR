Violence</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M010090/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed research will address the knowledge gap that exists regarding justice, inequality and gender based violence (GBV). The aim is to address how 'justice' (in its wider sense) is understood, sought, and experienced by victims/survivors of GBV and key practitioners. The proposal is original in including the diverse forms of GBV (sexual and domestic violence, forced marriage and so-called honour based violence) and by applying a mixed methods approach to intersectionality. Government research and consultations have consistently shown a justice gap in relation to sexual and domestic violence, forced marriage, and 'honour based violence' [4, 25, 5, 6, 7]. The concept of a 'justice gap' whilst often used to refer to issues of attrition within the criminal justice system (the dropping out of cases), also refers here to a wider gap in our understanding of what 'justice' means. Our own and other research has demonstrated that this wider justice gap is both complex and little understood. For instance, victims/survivors of GBV make decisions about accessing formal and/or informal systems of justice (criminal, civil, restorative), that can appear 'irrational' and be difficult for practitioners to understand, but are linked to GBV experiences and the intersecting inequalities victims/survivors may inhabit. Attrition can similarly exemplify positive as well as negative choices by GBV victims/survivors [8, 9, 10]. A considerable number of domestic violence cases are now being mediated through Sharia court practices, but we have no current understanding of how victims/survivors using religious based arbitration perceive the process and how it may contribute to experiences of 'justice' in the UK (see [11] for Canadian example).

The research aims will be addressed by asking the following research questions:
1) How do victims/survivors and others experience and perceive 'justice'? 
2) How does inequality affect access to support pathways and trajectories through the formal and informal justice systems? 
3) How are notions of empowerment linked to notions of justice and access to justice? 
4) How do practitioners themselves perceive notions of 'justice' whether enacted through formal or informal routes. 
5) What would a truly victim focused justice agenda for gender based violence look like?

The team is uniquely placed to carry out the project. By using existing data held by the research team and from national GBV databases, the research will add considerable added value without incurring excessive additional cost. The research has been designed to enable analysis of data relating to: a range of experiences of GBV, the positioning of individuals as victim/survivor and in relation to various forms of inequality (thereby enabling exploration of issues relating to intersectionality), and practitioner perspectives. It will also enable us to look at implications of recent changes in the formal and informal justice systems and policy and contexts of austerity. To address the questions we are proposing to conduct research in five stages: 1) reviews of the relevant literature including mapping of different perspectives on the social function of justice; 2) to build upon and enhance existing, mainly quantitative, data held by the applicants: police and court data on individual victim/survivor pathways through the criminal justice system and third sector victim/survivor data; 3) to collect additional in-depth information about different victim/survivor and practitioner group perspectives and experiences of GBV and justice focusing in particular on victims/survivors (on the basis of type of experience of GBV and inequality) whose experiences are often ignored; and 4) to bring that evidence together through further analysis and a meta-synthesis in order to understand more fully what a victim focused justice agenda would look like across different groups of victim/survivors; 5) final reports, data archiving and dissemination.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By working closely with a range of key third sector, justice and government agencies and organisations (see also Pathways to Impact) we intend to have a direct impact on the creation of victim focused policy and responses to gender based violence (GBV).

Who will benefit?
The most important beneficiaries will be victims/survivors: By exploring the different ways in which victims/survivors experience and perceive 'justice', by including those for whom more formal criminal and civil justice responses have failed to deliver, and exploring the different ways in which justice can be attained, including more informal or alternative approaches, we will widen the current debate of what 'justice' in the context of GBV means and provide a more nuanced picture of what a realistic victim focused justice response would look like. By working directly with the main GBV victim/survivor support organisations including Women's Aid, Welsh Women's Aid, Rape Crisis, Victim Support, IMKAAN, Survivor's Trust, Broken Rainbow, Galup, and others such as the Forced Marriage Unit, National Mediation and Respect, the research will be able to add voice to victim/survivor experiences. By using our close links with the Avon and Somerset and Northumbria police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service the research will feed voices of victims/survivors into the development of victim focused justice responses. 

Criminal and Civil Justice Agencies: Recent reports on GBV and access to justice [4, 25, 5, 6, 7] have been critical of both the police and other criminal justice agencies, and their lack of victim focused approaches. By providing detailed analysis of the trajectories of different groups of victims/survivors through the criminal justice system and also detailed and nuanced understanding of a wide range of victims/survivors' perspectives and experiences of different justice pathways and different forms of justice, the research will provide the potential for justice agencies to engage with victims in a way that incorporates the impact of inequalities and allows more realistic approaches to be developed. We will ensure justice agencies benefit from the research by close engagement with justice agencies, and in particular the police forces in the South West and North East of England and Wales, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Police College. 

Government Departments: Alongside specific criminal and civil justice agencies, government departments responsible for providing legal frameworks for justice in the case of GBV will benefit from the wider perspective provided by the proposed research, and the research will feed into the Government's GBV prevention and protection policy agendas. Through dissemination meetings with officials in the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Welsh Government the research will make an important contribution to the current policy debate regarding potential limitations of a justice approach focused on criminal justice, and it also has the potential to re-frame the debate by exploring wider experiences and expectations of justice, and existing as well as potential roles of alternative forms of justice. 

Specialist GBV Organisations and Advocacy Groups: The research, by widening the justice focus, allows recognition of the important role which advocates, such as Independent Domestic or Sexual Violence Advisors and others providing advocacy support, play in supporting those impacted by GBV irrespective of whether formal sources of justice have been achieved or not. Exploring victims/survivors' experiences and expectations of formal as well as informal and alternative routes to justice also allows a more detailed understanding of the role of empowerment in re-building notions of justice in victims/survivors' lives and within the wider communities in which such services operate. The research will thus enable advocacy agencies to enhance their work with victims/survivors in decisions about and access to justice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>780193</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cardiff Women's Aid</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Women's Aid</gtr:description><gtr:id>42F9B0AC-1DB9-42A5-8B72-4800E4B9E56E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Specialist knowledge used in research design; access to data; access to potential interview sample</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bc643c71a8a1.67544302-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners from Women's Aid (England and Wales) and Welsh Women's Aid are actively involved in the design and development of the research (e.g. attending and contributing knowledge to research meeting re stage 3 of the project), have provided the research team with access to data they collect from specialist domestic violence services (for analysis, which will compliment our analysis of criminal justice data) for stage 2 of the project and have also agreed to assist with the recruitment of an interview sample of victims/survivors and practitioners for Stage 3 of the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>None as yet..</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Respect (Domestic Violence Prevention Service)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>RESPECT</gtr:description><gtr:id>00D88C2B-AE2C-4F56-9692-64DE40A0A13B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bc6520796740.39665366-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Specialist knowledge has contributed to the development and design of the research.

The evidence was submitted as part of Mr Justice Cobbs review in September 2016. Ultimately the review led to revisions being made to the Practice Direction and the UK Government proceeding with primary legislation to ban cross-examination by unrepresented alleged perpetrators of alleged victims of domestic violence (January 2017). 
Enhancing the quality of life and/or health - examples of unsolicited feedback from our research participants have highlighted how taking part in such research may in some way positively impact on the individual victims/survivors of gender-based violence. For example a 'Thank you' card was sent to a member of the research team from a participant saying: &amp;quot;About 8 months ago I bought a plaque saying 'Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over it became a butterfly'. When I got it I thought it would have a point for me to aim for. Since meeting you it has a 'meaning'. You don't know what you have done for me in that short time. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Thank you so much. Can't put it into words!! Onwards and upwards!! x&amp;quot;. We intend to continue collecting evidence that suggests that the act of taking part in the research (e.g. via an interview or research-related event) has helped them articulate/understand/work through things, or if they said it felt good to talk about their experiences, or if they felt their experience was validated by the interview or interviewer.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E777AB6F-32FA-4D33-9A8E-20795FAC381B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c5d315452588.54220674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our literature search and mapping exercise confirmed that while there is much theoretical and conceptual work on justice, there is very little research on the meanings of justice for victims/survivors of, and practitioners in the field of, gender based violence. Most of the literature focused on domestic violence and abuse (including 'family violence', including adult child to parent abuse, and mother in law to daughter in law violence), followed by sexual violence and abuse, and more general pieces on gender based violence. The bulk is focused on the criminal justice system, with only a small proportion looking at civil measures or restorative approaches. As expected there was relatively little research on specific or 'alternative' forms of justice, such as faith based interventions and individual or group retaliatory justice mechanisms; and or how victims/survivors of gender based violence-and practitioners in the field- understand and experience justice. Much of the literature focused on primarily women's gendered position, as adversely affecting these experiences, and on being a parent or pregnant, or being an offender. There are gaps in research on other inequalities affecting survivors' experiences including age (with older and younger women being particularly vulnerable), sexuality, mental health, religion, immigration status. The mapping exercise also revealed the still under-researched areas, e.g. the quest for justice by adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse which is an area we would expect to grow in the coming years - or the justice challenges presented by the emergence of newer or more recently recognised forms of GBV, such as acid violence, stalking and harassment and abuse mediated through the different forms of social media. The reading and classification of the literature resulted in the identification of 19 theoretical models of justice being identified (including community justice, economic/financial/distributive justice, effective / affective justice, interactional justice, parallel justice, social justice and therapeutic justice /jurisprudence) which we are now exploring in the interview data in stage 3.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are being used by the project to inform further stages of he work.
