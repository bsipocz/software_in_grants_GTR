Internally epithelia are built into hollow tubes connected to ball-shaped alveoli, which form the common units of most organs. The hollow lumens within the tubes and alveoli are vital for correct tissue function, for example, alveoli in the breast secrete milk into the lumen which is then transported towards the nipple by connecting ducts. A common feature of epithelial tumours is that cells pile up in the lumen spaces blocking the ducts and alveoli. The displacement of cells might further contribute towards cancer progression. In this proposal we aim to explore the messages that control normal cell organization within breast tissue. This information is necessary so that we can identify and treat the defects that lead to breast cancer in future studies. 
Epithelia assemble within tissues by sticking to each other and a supportive matrix which coats the entire tissue. Attachments to the matrix occur through specific cell surface receptors called integrins. These receptors transmit information from the matrix to the cell. Adhesion to each other and the matrix create different instructions on each side of the cell, which means that epithelia accumulate distinct groups of proteins and fats on their top, bottom and sides, called epithelial polarization. This membrane configuration enables epithelia to form hollow spaces within tissues and secrete products into the lumen. How cells integrate many different signals from the matrix and interpret the messages to organize their membranes and position themselves properly within tissues remains poorly understood.
Using a specialized 3D tissue culture technology where isolated breast epithelia form tiny organoids, we recently discovered that beta1 integrin is essential for breast alveolar organization. Without this integrin, the alveoli became disorganized with cells blocking the lumen spaces, resembling an early breast cancer phenotype. We further revealed that loss of beta1 integrin blinded the cells to the matrix causing them to flip their tops and bottoms to opposite ends. We then confirmed our findings by removing this integrin from breast tissue within mice and found a similar effect of disorder. However, we spotted one key difference, the cells although blocking the lumen spaces were not completely upside down as in the culture model. Understanding this is of medical importance because misorientation of the membranes might alter cell behaviour. For instance some aggressive breast cancers that spread to lymph nodes have upside down cells, which might enable them to stick better inside lymph vessels aiding the spread of cancer. We hypothesize that in an intact animal epithelia receive extra messages from the matrix made by surrounding cells known as myoepithelia, which might prevent them from flipping over. Our original 3D organoids were almost devoid of this cell type and we have now built new co-culture technology containing both cell types that resembles breast tissue more accurately. Our objectives are to build transgenic mouse models to test how beta1 integrin from the two cell types assemble breast tissue inside mice. In parallel studies, we will use the co-culture organoids to dissect further how different integrin systems from the two breast cell types contribute to tissue architecture and attempt to restore tissue architecture by recreating the hollow spaces in the integrin defective alveoli. Overall, the work in this project will decipher how epithelial cells unravel information from the microenvironment to organize themselves properly within the breast. Ultimately this will lead to better strategies for the diagnosis of cancers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cell polarity is a defining feature for all epithelia, required for accurate cell division, differentiation and morphogenesis. In glandular organs polarization of epithelia results in the formation of lumens, which are essential for tissue function. Using the mammary gland we previously showed that cell interactions with the basement membrane through beta1 integrin is essential for the orientation of apicobasal polarity and lumen formation. Much of our understanding into mechanisms of lumen formation, come from the use of isotropic epithelial organoids, which incompletely reflect tissue organization in vivo. All secretory tissues are bi-layered with epithelia surrounded by myoepithelia and a basement membrane. How epithelia integrate signals from their microenvironment composed of other cell types to orient their polarity axis is poorly understood. We will focus on dissecting the role of integrins in tissue polarity from the different mammary cell lineages and establish how they synergize to achieve full function. To achieve this beta1 integrin gene function will be perturbed from each mammary compartment in vivo, using Cre-Lox technology and tissue architecture will be analysed in 3D using lightsheet imaging. Mammary organoid cocultures that recapitulate in vivo tissue architecture more accurately will validate in vivo data and will be used to deconstruct the mechanism further. Live imaging will be used to understand how integrins control correct positioning of the two mammary lineages. Downstream of polarity orientation we will define integrin pathways involved in lumen expansion by exploring beta1 integrin function in fluid transport through regulation of ion transporters, tight junctions and membrane permeability. By elucidating how BM signals regulate tissue organization we will contribute significantly to solving key questions about integrin control of cell polarity and potentially expose integrins as biomarkers that may be altered within precancerous tissue.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Who will benefit from this research?

The outcomes of this project will benefit i) researchers both in the UK and internationally, studying morphogenesis, organogenesis and regeneration during animal development, ii) investigators studying cancer development, iii) Pharmaceutical companies seeking new biomarkers for early detection of cancers 

2) How will they benefit from this research?

We focus here on groups ii) and iii) since these are the intermediaries whose activities are most likely to deliver the research's key impacts on the nation's health and wealth in the long term. 
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer within the western hemisphere, affecting approximately 48,000 women in the UK alone and causing significant suffering to individuals and their families. Increased prevalence is also causing a significant burden to economic costs. Our work is important both for early stage breast cancer diagnosis and for understanding the defects that lead to invasive micropapilliary cancers which currently have a very poor prognosis. Increased screening programs have led to identifying more women with irregular changes within the breast, resulting in difficulties in clinical judgments. Whether an early change has the propensity to develop into a malignant disease and therefore the appropriate course of action is difficult to predict. The problem is a lack of predictive biomarkers because currently it is not understood how the disease develops or progresses. In order to explain the nature of the defects that occur in breast cancer there is an essential need to figure out the processes that control normal developmental mechanisms within the breast. The work here will expose potential biomarkers that may be altered within precancerous tissue and micropapilliary cancers. This information is necessary for future investigations that confirm and translate our findings in disease models and patient samples. Being able to predict the outcome of an irregular change in the breast will have significant cost and health benefits within the UK because it may avoid unnecessary surgery and emotional trauma in women who are not at risk. By helping to understand the normal functioning of breast cells, the research will provide insights that will help to advance science towards better, more efficient and cost effective diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>601436</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P028411/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
