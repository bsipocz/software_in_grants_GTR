In each of Moyamba and Bombali Districts, comparisons will be made over two years between two similar, rural chiefdoms, one of which is an intervention condition and the other a comparison condition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The community-driven intervention includes work by the communities, government actors, and NGOs on preventing teenage pregnancy through a mixture of reproductive health education, family planning, and life skills. A contextually relevant survey instrument will be applied twice at intervals separated by 11 months to random samples of teenage girls and boys (13-19 years) in order to measure changes in risk and well-being outcomes for children. These outcomes were derived from a mixture of local views (in previous stages of the study) and those of international child rights standards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through its inter-agency networks, the research will encourage the use of population-based outcomes measures to track the effectiveness of the national child protection system and inform strategies for aligning and linking community mechanisms with government aspects of the child protection system.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research results could have significant impact in Sierra Leone and across the global child protection sector therefore the beneficiaries of the research will be at national and global level. In Sierra Leone, the beneficiaries will be:
1. Children and adult community members who are part of, or affected by child protection issues, including children affected by HIV and those living without appropriate care. The research findings and the participatory process of the programmatic intervention, will improve community level practice to prevent and respond to child protection violations. The ethnographic phase of the research has already demonstated the impact the research can have. In the process of feeding back the ethnographic findings to communities, and in response to a key finding about high levels of teengage pregnancy and associated risks, one of the research site communities decided to pass a new by-law to ensure that all teengage pregnancies which occur as a result of sexual abuse are reported and dealt with through the proper channels. It is expected that the research will also contribute to increased awareness of child protection issues and potentially decrease stigma associated with such issues in communities. 
2. Chiefs and decision makers in non-formal components of the child protection system. In Sierra Leone, government services for child protection do not extend operationally into rural areas therefore Chiefs and other community leaders are a critically important group to engage in the research. 
3. Local government staff in the research sites including social workers, police, family support unit staff, health workers and teachers. The research will provide evidence and generate information about how such workers can reach out and engage communities to better protect children.
4. The government of Sierra Leone, in particular policy makers responsible for social welfare and resource allocation for child protection. The Ministry for Social Welfare, which is the primary government department responsible for child protection, is the least funded government department. Policy-makers in this Ministry desperately require robust evidence of the cost-effectiveness of protection interventions to advocate for increased resource allocation from the national budget. The results of the ethnographic phase were received with keen interest by the Minister of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs, signalling the future impact the research can have on government policy. 
5. UNICEF and non-governmental organisations in Sierra Leone which are supporting protection programmes for the most vulnerable children, in particular Save the Children, World Vision, Plan International, War Child Holland, Defence for Children International and the International Rescue Committee. These organisations require robust evidence to help them support more effective interventions, including improving the effectiveness of, and scaling-up, current interventions.

At global level the beneficiaries will be:
1. Governments in the many other countries and regions which are implementing community-based child protection, who require examples of what works in strengthening and measuring the effectiveness of national child protection systems.
2. Donors for child protection programmes such as DFID, USAID, UNICEF and the European Commission which require evidence of what works and examples of indicators to measure child protection outcomes. 
3. UN Agencies and International NGOs (including those listed above) who are supporting large child protection programmes globally. It is expected that in other countries agencies will use similar outcome measures and processes to strengthen the evidence base, building on this model of good practice.
4. Inter-agency technical working groups in the global child protection community such as the Child Protection Working Group who design standards and guidance for the sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243842</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UNICEF</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sierra Leone Reference Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>09201BCD-F376-4973-BEAF-35236B24CB66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is multidisciplinary and involves child protection, health, and HIV and AIDS sectors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542ec31084fb20.86592075-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>UNICEF has provided significant staff time of one of its key Sierra Leonean child protection specialists who works with our team.

More recently, the Government has decided to use our community-driven approach in rolling out the new policy, first to two districts and then country-wide.

The research approach and findings are also being used in other regions to guide more community driven approaches to supporting vulnerable children. In Uganda and Tanzania, partner of two major private funders are working over the next two years to develop greater community ownership and power sharing in their programming, incorporating the lessons from the Sierra Leone research. In India, multiple agencies are using a similar action research and population based measurement approach to strengthen a community driven, bottom up approach that complements the Government's top-down approach to child protection. In many respects, this approach is an assertion of 'people's power' that helps to strengthen good governance as well as community action on behalf of vulnerable children.

In writing and publication, too, the results of the Sierra Leone action research are being used to boost research impact. the PI and six co-authors (including Sierra Leoneans) wrote an invited chapter entitled &amp;quot;How Collaboration, Early Engagement and Collective Ownership Increase Research Impact: Strengthening Community-Based Child Protection Mechanisms in Sierra Leone&amp;quot; which will be included in an edited collection from the ESRC DFID Impact Initiative and the Institute of Development Studies. The volume will be published in Fall, 2016 and will spur discussions with policy leaders via a symposium planned for mid-February, 2017. In the educational sector, efforts are under way at Columbia University and also via the AfriChild Centre in Uganda to help graduate students learn how to use more community driven approaches. Through these and related efforts, the lessons and approaches of the action research will be brought forward to wider public and private audiences.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B9DA540A-F5FD-44F6-8F30-8D3127FF4878</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dda9b3813163.95996360</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We discovered that community-driven action on behalf of vulnerable children is an effective, sustainable means on supporting children who suffer significant vulnerability, in this case due to teenage pregnancy.

This ethnographic findings were one of the dominant sources cited in the new policy document.

The funded action research tests the effectiveness of community driven action to support children who are vulnerable due to teenage pregnancy, which leads girls to drop out of school and in many cases to engage in transactional sex in order to support themselves and their families. The preliminary findings of our measurement of children's risk and well-being outcomes (and the use of a quasi-experimental design) have helped to create a viable model for implementing the community aspects of the new policy. Indeed, they have inspired the leaders, the managers, and the UN (UNICEF) and NGO technical implementing partners of the Ministry of Social Welfare Gender and Children's Affairs to use the community-driven intervention process as the main community-level approach in implementing the new policy. A technical group consisting of UNICEF and four NGOs has been established to scale the tested model up to other provinces. Sierra Leonean members of our research team advise and help provide trainings when needed on the methodology, including measurement aspects of the work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54529292c6d339.39151748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This work has developed a survey of children's risk and well-being outcomes that follows a public health approach to enabling child protection and well-being.
