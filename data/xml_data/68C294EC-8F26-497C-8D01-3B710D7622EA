&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will involve a team of researchers, practitioners, young people, a film-maker and a theatre director/writer who will use original research on young people?s sexual relationships and cultures to produce the following outputs:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Three short films targeting;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Stakeholders: The 300,000 (plus) young people that Brook works with annually will benefit from improved access to information, advice and guidance around pleasure both directly from Brook website or from staff at Brook who have received training and/or are using the materials. Brook employs a large and diverse workforce through its national network of centres who in turn work with a range of professionals. The project would give these staff access to specialist training and resources in an area of priority need. The project will also contribute to the evidence base shaping the work of Brook, an urgent need for an organisation which must demonstrate the effectiveness of its work and which relies on high quality research to underpin advocacy and public awareness. The project contributes directly to Brooks' Sex Positive campaign and the outputs would be made freely available to the wider sexual health field through Brook's online platform. Brook has an established group of young volunteers who are trained and supported by the organisation to enable peer to peer education. This group would develop skills as a result of the participatory filmmaking that would be of individual benefit but would also increase capacity in other areas of Brooks work. The study will share the lessons of the work with the research community, establishing an interest group and blog within the social networking site Methodspace. Finally, the proposed project would make a significant contribution to the skills development for an early career researcher who will go on to employ these skills for the good of the wider research and practice community. These skills include new expertise in participatory film making, blogging and the development of training material. 

2. Effective impact: The project has many characteristics associated with effective impact. It builds on a long term collaboration between the two senior leads and addresses a research problem defined by the user group. It involves users at all stages of the research - from commissioning the original doctoral project through to the conceptualising and planning this proposal - making the researcher exceptionally well placed to fulfil the aims of the project. The project also builds on well established partnerships and platforms including a tried and tested relationship with the consultant filmmaker and the use of a sophisticated online platform with an established audience. The project will contribute content to Brooks' existing communications strategy for 2013 and in doing so provide value for money in terms of the audience reached through planned events and ongoing public relations work. Management support will be made available through Professor Thomson and Simon Blake and Ester McGeeney would have the wider support of Sussex University's Centre for Innovation and Research in Childhood and Youth. Finally, the project involves the appropriate use of intermediaries and knowledge brokers including a professional film-maker who will deliver outputs of the highest quality.

3. Pathway for impact: In the first 12 months the project would provide urgently needed evidence to Brook for use in organisational and service development. In the medium term (18 months - 2 years) the project would contribute to a culture shift within Brook and other sexual health organisations, enabling staff to more confidently engage with young people's experiences and concerns about sexual pleasure and its absence. In the longer term (3 years) this will be realised through a contribution to the quality of sexual health services and education, mitigating the negative consequences associated with the kinds of sexual risk taking associated with social exclusion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53681</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of films created collaboratively with young people, researchers and media professionals as part of the Good Sex Knowledge Exchange project that was a collaboration between young people's sexual health agency Brook and researchers at the Centre for Innovation and Research in Childhood and Youth at the University of Sussex.

In particular this project has targeted youth and sexual health practitioner communities. This was been achieved through setting up a 2 day workshop for young people, a 10 week workshop for young people, 1 pilot training day and 2 training days for practitioners. It was also been achieved through ongoing informal interaction and collaboration between the lead researcher on the project and practitioners at Brook. All of the resources created during this project are publicly available online and are being used by practitioners, young people and the general public. The team have followed up and documented the impact of the training and resources on Brook staff. its advocacy work and on the development of the young people involved in the project, a full report can be found at the project blog https://goodsexproject.wordpress.com

The project has produced the following outputs:

1. A series of short films that reanimate interview data from the original research about young people's experiences of first sex. There are 13 films in total that reanimate 11 different stories. These are available on Brook's website and on You Tube where they have collectively had over 300 views. 
2. Two short films that reanimate survey data from the original research on good / bad sex. These are available on the Brook website and on You Tube where there have been nearly 3,000 views. 
3. A one-day training course on sexual pleasure that has been piloted and delivered to 31 participants from Brook and partner organisations. The training course materials and linked education resources are available to download from the project website: http://goodsexproject.wordpress.com/training-resources/ These have currently been viewed 176 times. 
4. A short training session for Brook trustees delivered on 5th June. 
5. A series of short films based on interviews with practitioners and researchers about why it is important to talk about sexual pleasure and how it might be possible to do this in practice. These are available on You Tube and have had over 400 views at present. 
6. A short film that sets out 12 reasons why it is important to talk to young people about pleasure and 12 ways in which it might be possible to do so. 
7. A review of the evidence on why it is important to embed sexual pleasure and sex positive approaches in youth sexual health service delivery. 
8. A project blog containing 11 posts on methods of knowledge exchange used and developed and 7 pages of content including links to research, films, education resources and training materials. The blog has had over 5,000 views from 3,000 viewers in 67 countries predominately in the UK (1,576 views), followed by the US (173), Turkey (45) and Saudia Arabia (39). 

A review of impact after 12months concluded 'The good sex project focussed on contributing to organisational change and capacity and was able to train only a small number of staff members and colleagues from partner organisations. Data from the impact survey evaluation suggests however that the learning and materials from this training have been disseminated widely, before to colleagues and community partners and to young people locally. When asked about the wider social impacts of training youth practitioners to talk to young people about pleasure, professionals who attended the training referred to the impact for young people, sex and relationships education and social attitudes and values.'

This was to be achieved through creating flexible resources that could be used in in organisational development, training and campaigning. We aimed to develop new and creative methods for engaging in practices of knowledge exchange between practitioners, researchers, young people and artists with a view to consolidating these relationships and building shared understanding of real world problems in the field of young people's sexual health. 

Key findings of the project were as follows: 

- The project found that it was possible to engage young people as research collaborators, working with sensitive research materials about sex and sexuality. Young people were enthusiastic about participating in group activities and discussion, in particular about consent, gender inequalities, female sexual pleasure and enjoyment, the experience of first sex, homosexuality and the absence of male sexual pleasure in sexual encounters. These were challenging, controversial and emotive topics that young people suggested were rarely openly discussed. The creative methods and activities developed over the course of the project provided a valuable platform for discussing and debating these topics and for enabling young people to learn about other young people's sexual experiences using the research data. 

- The project highlighted the benefits of having a 'researcher-in-residence' at the partner organization for enabling informal and every day exchange of knowledge, values and practices. It also highlighted the value of a four way collaboration between researchers, young people, practitioners and artists for developing new methods for researching young people's sexual cultures and engaging in creating practices of knowledge exchange. 
- 
- Discussions with practitioners and interviews with experts in the field suggest that it is increasingly acceptable to talk about 'good sex' and sexual pleasure in sexual health and sex education domains but there remains an absence of resources, training and resources to enable practitioners to carry out this work. Experts identified the ongoing absence of spaces for talking about sex and sexuality in their personal and professional lives and the need for safe and protected spaces to reflect on their personal values and professional practice. 

- The project highlighted the need for good quality training on how to engage young people in work around sexual pleasure for all those working in the sector including education practitioners, nurses, doctors, receptionists and counselors. Practitioners identified a preference for face-to-face rather than online training due to the importance of group work and discussion for challenging assumptions, generating new ideas and providing opportunities to share best practice. 

- The project highlighted the importance for practitioners of feeling like their work in this area is formally sanctioned by their employer and backed up by relevant research and policy. Training for practitioners was identified as an important space for this but only when accompanied by backing at the commissioning level. 

- The training materials and education resources developed over the course of this project could be widely used and disseminated to address this need. More work is required however to evaluate these and other resources and 'sex-positive' approaches to start to develop an evidence base in this field. The project has identified that this would be valuable to researchers, practitioners and commissioners.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has produced the following outputs:
