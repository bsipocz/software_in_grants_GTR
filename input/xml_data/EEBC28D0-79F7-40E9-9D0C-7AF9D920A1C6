In addition a series of interviews adds depth to the interpretation. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has four pathways of impact. Each works through a different immediate audience.
--1) Villagers and townspeople in the survey areas, and all those who experience Indian and Bangladeshi policy changes. In interviewing, we gather comments on the interventions themselves in the semi-structured interview. In India our focus may be on the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme plus any changes in local educational provision that affect labouring classes. In Bangladesh we focus on initiatives influencing women as entrepreneurs, workers, and farmers. By involving people in interviews, the research is much enriched and we will be wiser through using mixed methods. Although the research is not action research per se, our approach is continually to be open to discussion, available for consultations, and willing to organise focus groups not for research data gathering but for the purpose of engaging in discussion without recording so that we create a democratic and open setting for considering the difficult issues of women's work. Our ability to 'listen well' will affect the quality and usefulness of the results that we publish. Our first publication of a briefing paper will be within Year 1 based on pilots in each country. IHD staff will lead on this.

--2) Policy practitioners who will be consulted at least once per year in three study areas. A stakeholder workshop in each country in Year 1 involves in-country experts and local policy practitioners by invitation. They can influence the questionnaire, interview plans, integration of men in the study, and analysis of themes. By inviting selected practitioners to data confrontation workshops in year 2, we ensure a continuing two-way feedback route for co-learning.

--3) The project also influences all who are involved in or affected by the new Survey and Interviews. The research enumerators employed by the Institute for Human Development and the BRAC University Centre for Gender and Social Transformation will be influenced toward knowing more about sophisticated Survey and Interview methods as well as about gender roles, norms and attitudes. In India, too, the staff of the project can move onward into research posts with their enhanced data collection and data analysis skills. In creating a survey instrument on attitudes about gender roles, basing the questions on some existing well-known autonomy and attitude questions but also adding new indicators of the attitudes to women's in-house activities and the domestic division of labour, the project creates higher consciousness of gender issues. The integration of the survey data with interviews of both male and female adult rural residents creates new knowledge. Translation and interpretation will be exposed to scrutiny of the whole team in workshops. The project probes changing power and autonomy of women by asking what promotes it, what barriers there are, and what impact the anti-poverty projects have played. Thus gender and development policy issues are raised among the whole large teams of researchers in each country.

--4) Finally this project influences academics and experts in the countries concerned. These impacts are described under 'Academic Beneficiaries' but in addition the considerable Capacity Building element includes two data confrontation workshops (one per country) and numerous training opportunities on-site in the two liaising organisations. The researchers act as role models for masters and phd students in IHD and BRAC, as well. Advanced quantitative methods and critical realist approaches to qualitative interpretation (notably critical discourse analysis) will be promoted. The use of NVIVO software will be actively encouraged among all user groups to hold case-study material. The use of advanced software will be promoted. Programmes will be shared through the public JISC online filestore platform. A JISC shared email will be created, with W. Olsen as moderator and file manager.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>310179</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Close the Gap</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Win-Win Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>ECC88636-60E2-45D2-A615-B741ED013A0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcomes of the partnership include a report written for the Close the Gap partnership, authors Wendy Olsen, David Bayliss and Min Zhang.

&amp;quot;Causes of Defeminisation of Work in Rural India Over the Long Term&amp;quot; - a submitted paper.
Abstract
India had a declining labour force participation for women 2004-2011. There were positive real rates of economic growth during the same time period. Higher female formal education over this period should have raised the labour-force participation rate. Countervailing factors create a puzzle of 'missing women', also called defeminisation. Using national data on economic activity, we provide a novel analysis of India's rural women using 1983-2011 data and a synthetic panel data approach.
The paper tests several hypotheses. Relative to existing knowledge, this paper is enhanced by a theoretical shift, examining the labour market in its narrow, medium and wide definitions. We decompose the change in labour supply of women over time, according to explained factors and unexplained factors, taking advantage of data from National Sample Surveys for 1983, 1993, 2005, and 2012 involving consistent measurement over time. We use probit regressions of labour supply. Ultimately there was a downward shift of the whole U-curve of women's work over education. Our main finding is that the shift downward in women's work (over education) is concentrated in poor landless worker families of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe groups. We describe the balance of protective and causal factors for the growing employment gap facing women. We saw a re-establishment of the breadwinner model in the poor rural classes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8028eb38ee5.54195374</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference Presentatioin in Sri Lanka on &quot;Human Capital, Food security and Economic Development&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D304820-559A-4666-90F2-C9DD3512D7B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation for a Conference on &amp;quot;Human Capital, Food security and Economic Development in South Asia&amp;quot;

Keywords rural employment, habitus, discourse.

Abstract:
In rural north central India and Bangladesh, the prevalent rural pattern is that when woman have children, they &amp;quot;withdraw&amp;quot; from the labour market. We are researching the question: if a woman's role is socially normed to include market work, does a man's activity basket adjust to allow for that? Do their two sets of activities 'fit' well together? 
Time-use data show the women working considerable amounts on farm plots and with livestock. Thus it was ideological and a masking strategy for elites to describe the women as 'not in the labour force' or as housewives. Interview data shows widespread lip service to a command/submit pattern in marriages, but in reality, many women and men often negotiate about work duties. As Bourdieu advises, we trace the antifeminist command/submit marital discourse through Bengali and Indian history. Discourse contradicts the reality. Still, the doxa of patriarchy affect the current habitus. We consider the social status and stigma attached to 'working outside the home', both at the ideological level and at the deeper level of resources. Some widows had a more reflective, active life than younger wives. We test whether women's egalitarian attitudes about work are associated with wealth, land ownership, or doing more work. We transcend the neoclassical human capital approach. We test whether egalitarian women work more (or less) minutes per-day in 2014/5. In villages, demographic features affecting women, like having children, disability, or bad health, are converted into socially normative constraints upon women, yet many people do resist the patriarchal habitus.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c802f558e323.10800332</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Qualitative Research Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CD93F51-333D-482C-882D-169C5DCB9CD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop introduced participants to use NVivo software in analysing transcripts of semi-structured interviews by applying a new method of discourse analysis.

Well-Being Methodology for Studying Well-Being of Poor People In Bangladesh
Our research in Bangladesh shows a dynamic, morphogenetic situation for survey and interview data on Subjective Well-Being. We theorise how the well-being survey data relate to interview data. We triangulate using time-use diary data. Women in villages suffer considerable threats to their self-respect.

By Wendy Olsen with Samantha Watson and John McLoughlin. Abstract:

The need for a dispassionate approach to analysing mixed methods data led me to using NVIVO in combination with the British National Corpus. The latter covers varied uses of English, and we examine the prevalence of words in our own Qualitative Corpus versus the BNC. Next codes in NVIVO reflect the 30 words surrounding each high-prevalence 'keyword' based on Touri and Koteyko (IJSRM, 18:6, 2015). Research teams can agree on this overview of keywords, then conduct discourse analysis, in-depth hermeneutics etc. on a part of these findings. We can discover the presence of intertextuality, examine which cases use which discourses, and check on the absence of certain discursive features. Overall it offers rigour and transparency. The method gives a high level of confidence that a research team has a sense of all the key issues and themes in a set of qualitative materials. The confidence in the balanced attention to topics and discourses is high when compared with the usual method where individuals glance at a few sets of pages (perhaps 40 pages out of 1000 in a typical corpus of 20 Semi-Structured Interviews, with 50 pages per interview). The individual researcher may find 5 intriguing themes in these 40 pages. However what is missed is any sense of the presence/absence and the relative prevalence of intertextuality across the whole range of the materials. In this paper we summarise the findings from matrix coding queries for a set of 35 South Indian interviews that were translated into English from Telugu around 2006-7.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c977692a4b49.05005831</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dhaka Training Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B09B4D83-064F-49D1-8B9D-946F1DFE7AA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held two informal training workshops of 3 hours each in the BRAC, in Brac University (a private University), Dhaka.

Abstract
In spite of high economic growth during last two decades there has been low rate of female labour force participation (FLP) in India. This has been the recent issue that have to be looked into thoroughly. More than in any other area, it is in the recording of the work done by women that serious inaccuracies and measurement failure occurs. As a result, participation of women in the economic activities in developing countries in general and in India in particular is undermined. 

The experience from other countries suggests that the combined effect of economic growth, rising educational label among women and falling fertility rates leads to increasing participation of women in labour force. India's rate of economic growth has averaged over 6 per cent since 1991, female literacy rate of women has increased from 53.7 per cent in 2001 to 64.5 per cent in 2011, and total fertility rate has fallen from 3.71 in 1990 to 2.50 in 2012. In spite of this, female workforce participation rates fell from 33.1 per cent in 1977-78 to 26.1 per cent in 2009-10 for rural females and from 15.6 per cent in 1977-78 to 13.8 per cent in 2009-2010 for urban females (using employment in principal and subsidiary status, see Himanshu (2011).

Census after Census, women's contribution has been rendered invisible by failing to quantify their work inputs, especially in agriculture and the unorganized sector. There are basically two kinds of work. Work for which payment is received and work for which no payment is made. Women are known to work longer hours than men and to participate in the work force to a far greater extent than is measured by the data gathered in the census. But a lot of the work they do is unrecognized, leave alone rewarded with equal remuneration. Traditionally, men spend most of their time on tasks for which payment is received or tasks that are clearly within the realm of &amp;quot;economic activity&amp;quot; (Mehta, 2000). However, while a large number of women work outside the home and are remunerated for the work they do, most women spend several hours doing work for which no payment is received. This seems as a disguised exclusion of rural women from the mainstream of economy. The effort of the present paper is to only investigate and share our field experiences of this fact from Rural North India.

Abstract: The need for a dispassionate approach to analysing mixed methods data led me to using NVIVO in combination with the British National Corpus. The latter covers varied uses of English, and we examine the prevalence of words in our own Qualitative Corpus versus the BNC. Next codes in NVIVO reflect the 30 words surrounding each high-prevalence 'keyword' based on Touri and Koteyko (IJSRM, 18:6, 2015). Research teams can agree on this overview of keywords, then conduct discourse analysis, in-depth hermeneutics etc. on a part of these findings. We can discover the presence of intertextuality, examine which cases use which discourses, and check on the absence of certain discursive features. Overall it offers rigour and transparency. The method gives a high level of confidence that a research team has a sense of all the key issues and themes in a set of qualitative materials. The confidence in the balanced attention to topics and discourses is high when compared with the usual method where individuals glance at a few sets of pages (perhaps 40 pages out of 1000 in a typical corpus of 20 Semi-Structured Interviews, with 50 pages per interview). The individual researcher may find 5 intriguing themes in these 40 pages. However what is missed is any sense of the presence/absence and the relative prevalence of intertextuality across the whole range of the materials. In this paper we summarise the findings from matrix coding queries for a set of 35 South Indian interviews that were translated into English from Telugu around 2006-7.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c804d8b4cd36.81483415</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sociology.ed.ac.uk/events/other_events/2015_2016/big_qualidata_tackling_analysis_of_very_large_volumes_of_qualitative_data_in_social_science_research</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference Presentation at Mixed Methods International Research Association (MIMRA) Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>10F4D38E-A0CB-4705-84C9-097658BB2414</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Heather Piggott presented her second set of PhD results to the following international conference:

Amaresh Dubey, Anup K Mishra , Wendy Olsen , Santosh K Singh 
 
Introduction
In spite of high economic growth during last two decades there has been low rate of female labour force participation (FLP) in India. This has been the recent issue that have to be looked into thoroughly. More than in any other area, it is in the recording of the work done by women that serious inaccuracies and measurement failure occurs. As a result, participation of women in the economic activities in developing countries in general and in India in particular is undermined. 
The experience from other countries suggests that the combined effect of economic growth, rising educational label among women and falling fertility rates leads to increasing participation of women in labour force. India's rate of economic growth has averaged over 6 per cent since 1991, female literacy rate of women has increased from 53.7 per cent in 2001 to 64.5 per cent in 2011, and total fertility rate has fallen from 3.71 in 1990 to 2.50 in 2012. In spite of this, female workforce participation rates fell from 33.1 per cent in 1977-78 to 26.1 per cent in 2009-10 for rural females and from 15.6 per cent in 1977-78 to 13.8 per cent in 2009-2010 (using employment in principal and subsidiary status, see Himanshu (2011).
Census after Census, women's contribution has been rendered invisible by failing to quantify their work inputs, especially in agriculture and the unorganized sector. There are basically two kinds of work. Work for which payment is received and work for which no payment is made. Women are known to work longer hours than men and to participate in the work force to a far greater extent than is measured by the data gathered in the census. But a lot of the work they do is unrecognized, leave alone rewarded with equal remuneration. Traditionally, men spend most of their time on tasks for which payment is received or tasks that are clearly within the realm of &amp;quot;economic activity&amp;quot; (Mehta, 2000). However, while a large number of women work outside the home and are remunerated for the work they do, most women spend several hours doing work for which no payment is received. This seems as a disguised exclusion of rural women from the mainstream of economy. The effort of the present paper is to only investigate and share our field experiences of this fact from Rural North India.

Abstract:
 In rural north central India and Bangladesh, the prevalent rural pattern is that when woman have children, they &amp;quot;withdraw&amp;quot; from the labour market. We are researching the question: if a woman's role is socially normed to include market work, does a man's activity basket adjust to allow for that? Do their two sets of activities 'fit' well together? 
 Time-use data show the women working considerable amounts on farm plots and with livestock. Thus it was ideological and a masking strategy for elites to describe the women as 'not in the labour force' or as housewives. Interview data shows widespread lip service to a command/submit pattern in marriages, but in reality, many women and men often negotiate about work duties. As Bourdieu advises, we trace the antifeminist command/submit marital discourse through Bengali and Indian history. Discourse contradicts the reality. Still, the doxa of patriarchy affect the current habitus. 
We measured women's overall subjective well-being, comparing widows with other rural women. We consider this both at the ideological level and at the deeper level of resources. Some widows had a more reflective, active life than younger wives.
 We test whether women's egalitarian attitudes about work are associated with wealth, land ownership, or doing more work. We transcend the neoclassical human capital approach. We test whether egalitarian women work more (or less) minutes per-day in 2014/5. In villages, demographic features affecting women, like having children, disability, or bad health, are converted into socially normative constraints upon women, yet many people do resist the patriarchal habitus. 
 Rural local data from 2015/6 about rural and urban labour markets, or particular sectors, will be presented. We use both standard mixed methods and innovative methods. We have time-use diary data for rural India and we also carried out a discourse analysis of interviews translated into English then brought into correspondence with a wide-ranging survey from the same set of 900 rural Indian &amp;amp; Bangladeshi Households.

 These findings reflect a research project &amp;quot;Gender Norms, Labour Supply and Poverty Reduction in Bangladesh and India&amp;quot;. This exciting project is funded by ESRC DFID. 

 We combined in one survey the evidence about people's attitudes about gendered work stereotypes alongside measures of work-time in rural India and Bangladesh. We thus discuss our measures of the social differentiation of work (in rural areas with many poor people) in conjunction with attitudes about women's work.

We expect to produce briefings on Mixing Data with Keyness and Discourse Analysis later in 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c805627e6921.20427486</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper for Conference of the Indian Society for Labour Economics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B460669-EFEE-42EE-AD84-3F5B3D6E292A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference Presentation
&amp;quot;Work of Women is Affected by Norms About Gender Roles in India and Bangladesh&amp;quot;
Abstract 
In response to a decline in Indian rural women's formal labour supply, this paper explores attitudes and norms about gender in northern central states of India alongside Bangladesh. The specific coverage of the paper is 1995-2012 including five states of India: Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Chattisgarh. The first part of the paper explores attitudes using a sociological concept of a social norm, against which an individual's attitude may vary toward a more, or less, egalitarian approach to women's roles. The second discovers a positive association of the more egalitarian attitudes of women to their own prevalence in paid work and self-employment. Our baseline for work status is inactivity. In spite of doubts about the accuracy of measurement of remunerated work, this study is able (convincingly) to show two findings. First, that all of this region of India has social norms which are less favourable to women's equality with men than any part of Bangladesh. Second, that attitudes within the area vary sufficiently for women's agency to be both possible, and even encouraged, vis-a-vis their array of different kinds of work both inside and outside the home and farm. We conclude with suggestions for further research to explore social change over time in this phenomenon of social heterogeneity of attitudes. Such research is central to economics, and does not belong only in other disciplines such as sociology. 
We use the Demographic and Health Survey data (in India, National Family and Health Survey) alongside the smaller World Values Survey.

Our research has led to numerous teams being encouraged to do - and to further explore - mixed methods of research that cross the Qual-Quant divide. This will prove highly cost-effective and can lead to high-citation academic articles. Here are 3 examples of our impact withing the academic &amp;amp; practitioner community:

1) IACR.

Olsen presented a whole stream on mixed-methods research at the conference of the International Association for Critical Realism (IACR). This stream was on methods of research for development studies. Olsen then got a book contract with Watson for an edited volume on the same topic (in process). The IACR stream had 6 papers involving 8 presenters, and was a great success with a stronger participative and data-confrontation element than usual. Olsen papers: &amp;quot;The Capabilities Approach to Wellbeing, a data-confrontation workshop (with Bayliss).&amp;quot; And &amp;quot;Critical Realism and Health Data-Response Workshop&amp;quot;. These workshops were full.

2) JNU in Delhi / and Bourdieu Sociologists at Bristol in the UK, sharing evidence across the economics-sociology divide.

Olsen presented at a Bourdieu conference held by the British Sociological Association (BSA); she presented a jointly authored paper &amp;quot;Labour and Marital Negotiations (and Tensions): Comparing Rural India &amp;amp; Bangladesh&amp;quot;. Useful feedback was obtained from an expert sociological audience. The paper uses mixed methods. She also presented this paper in Delhi at the JNU in May 2016. She is again visiting JNU for further discussions around the themes of using factor analysis along with qualitative research in economic areas of life, in April 2017. 

3) Prof. Amaresh Dubey won a University of Manchester Simon Visiting Professorship which lasted six weeks (all expenses paid). He then went on to get involved in the Chronic Poverty Report effort based at ODI in London. This report has become a major feature in the development calendar, giving an update on poverty-eradication measures and progress over time across the whole world. 

We continue to develop the Win-Win Partnership which integrates all these moves in one big social network. The Win-Win partners comprise two mailing lists. Our partners number 5 core institutions plus 11 additional indirectly linked institutions across the four countries. Our mailing list for Briefing Papers covers the 17 involved staff and another 80 individual stakeholders. We recently gained another 6 early-career staff participants, namely:
Sook Kim, incoming PhD student.
Giuseppe Maio, MSc student and casual Research Associate.
Wasel Bin Shadat, post-doctoral Research Assocation.
Jihye Kim, partner to our partner Centre for Women's Development Studies in Delhi, India.
Min Zhang, PhD student and research associate.
Joanna Wilson, ESRC funded 1+3 PhD student using mixed methods for UK women's pay.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F966AE2D-8EF9-4640-9D86-8D95AE4C35BA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463aefe845511.75828982</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our study focuses on gender and labour by combining in one survey evidence about people's attitudes about gendered work stereotypes alongside measures of work-time in rural India and Bangladesh. 

We aimed initially to examine reasons for India's declining labour force participation of women between 1983 and 2011. In Bangladesh, we found there were clashes relating to social norms about women as housewives versus the government and NGOs promoting the idea of women as entrepreneurs. In India, our historical survey of women's labouring, shows they are tending to withdraw from the formal employment sector (around 7 per cent were lost from 1990 to 2011). We are almost ready to publish our findings, but meanwhile the same issue has been noticed by more than 12 other scholars and the New York Times. 

Women's participation in informal work:

To some extent there is a reassertion of the breadwinner model of the household in rural India. On the other hand, outmigration of men leaves up to 30 per cent of households practically female-headed, and women taking greater responsibility for domestic and informal work. We also found in rural Bangladesh that after telling us, in principle, that women rarely 'work', there is still a huge amount of informal work time being spent on two activities by Muslim women there: managing livestock (chickens, cattle, goats, sheep) and vegetable and rice farming.

We also have data from southern Bangladesh and from river areas, where fisheries has been important for over 40 years. Here, the poverty levels are reported to have risen. The returns to fishing have declined while the population dependent on the fisheries - both fish and shrimp - has increased over time. Again, many men migrate out, leaving the few who are living there to work long shifts, nights and repeat shifts. Family members often help out. This management of work is totally informalised and yet contributes to Bangladesh's Gross National Income. As far as official records go, the value of fisheries is caught further up the chain (not to make a pun). Here fish traders and companies buy the fish from farmbased traders, and when it finally enters the GNI or gross value added figures, often at the time of export, the values are attributed mainly to male urban workers in manufacturing, eg packing. But at village level two data sources are tending to suggest women do involve themselves in fisheries:

? Interviews show women 'helping' - this wording is insulting as they are in fact working. And:
? Time-Use records show women spending time on fisheries work.

We know from India's Kerala experience that women's work is often undervalued in the Export Industries when they start to manufacture food products for onward sale. Men in marketing, a packing, transport, and ownership roles get more revenue from these primary products upon resale. 

Putting this whole story together will take more time, as our primary survey results are only now flowing in. (Another pun, with the river scenes of the Char [island] residents vivid in our minds. And in Uttar Pradesh our respondents live rather near the great Ganges river, whose pollution by manufacturing and fertilizer is a hot issue.) 

The mixed-methods approach provides rare insights into social norms. We use NVIVO to analyse the qualitative data. We now have 86 interviews in NVIVO in ENglish translation. There are hundreds of 'key words'. These fit into about 7 discourse areas for each country, with around 5 of these overlapping across the two countries (e.g. work and agriculture topics). Within each topic, there are competing discourses. We are now analysing these around themes of husband-as-master discipline discourse, work as bringing dignity to farming women and so on. In each case a competing discourse may present women in a differen tlight, e.g. respectively: the equality discourse where women and men are considered equal in discussing issues before a household decision is made; and breadwinner discourse in which she 'should' be a mother and housewife.

Our three year project employs interviews, surveys with complex questionnaires, and time-use diary by recall methods. Secondary data is also used to give a national overview. 

The data were gathered from the two countries in two rounds, covering around 15 + 9 = 24 villages. We have now manipulated and studied the time-use data. We set up 40 categories to label time-use in 15 minute stints. Meanwhile, in 2015, the Indian government announced that it would do a nationwide survey of time-use of the same kind. However funding has so far been withheld so Government of India is delayed in their big project. The Human Development Survey of India Round 3 may have some relevant measures but will not have a time-use diary. It is India's only panel survey.

This government time-use survey would invite both economists and a wider range of users to get to grips with such data. Our view is that economics should not dominate the analysis. Economics is a broader discipline than the way it is presently construed. Economic research is a part of development studies making normative interpretations as well as providing facts and models. Thus we feel our time-use study is quite valuable at this key time. The previous studies by Indira Hirway et al. had larger sample size than ours, but they did not have the same range of variables besides time.

For example we have records of women's and men's attitudes toward the stereotypical roles women play. The gender of the respondent did not make much difference in attitudes in either Bangladesh or north India's rural areas, we found. Also, there are strong commonalities in our Rural survey data across rural Bangladesh and rural North Central India. However, Olsen et al. have conducted and completed a close anlaysis of attitudes in the Demography &amp;amp; Health Survey data for these two zones, finding considerable regional differences (in process of submitting for publication).

Using nationally representative data from three sources we did find significant regional differences in broad social attitudes about women:
? Demographic and Health survey measures of women's autonomy show more autonomy for working women in India than in Bangladesh
? World Values Survey although its sample size is too small for sub national regions, shows Bangladesh people keen on equality but traditional about the breadwinning role of men.
? The National Family and Health Survey on India, which encompasses the DHS, helpful for the first study which can be carried out on a statewise basis within India due to fairly good sample sizes in India.

We did not find a huge amount of time being spent on climate-change adaptation activities such as firewood or water carrying. 

We found a wide range of levels of subjective well-being. These were not easily discerned to be explained by any one particular structural factor. Our study has measured the time-use, well-being and employment of both men and women. We are now moving toward the study of which families engaged with NGOs, employment schemes and government benefit schemes. These engagements are more rare than one might hope. In Bangladesh, a strong proportion of households had borrowed from their employers, and reporting of debt from several sources was common. In India, the MNREGA existed in our study areas. 

We continue to liaise in our multi-disciplinary teams in the two countries. We are appearing at numerous upcoming conferences including the International Association for Feminist Economics, the Association for Heterodox Economics, the Development Studies Association and our own special Conferences planned for 2016/7 in Varanasi, India, Dhaka and Delhi. We are grateful to our funders, the ESRC, DFID, and British Academy, for making all this possible.

To join our mailing list and get Briefing Papers from this project, please send a request to wendy.olsen@manchester.ac.uk. Briefings are currently available on Ethics, Sampling, and Factor Analysis. We expect to produce papers on Mixing Data with Keyness and Discourse Analysis later in 2017.

The project is funded by the ESRC DFID Poverty Alleviation grant stream and is supported through direct involvement in research of BRAC University Centre for Gender and Social Transformation (CGST, Dhaka), the GIGA Institute of Asian Studies, and the Indian Institute for Dalit Studies (IIDS Delhi).

Our finalised papers show what inhibits women from doing productive work in agriculture including livestock, and fishing, though many women do in fact engage in these activities. We found out in particular that *wanting* to do paid work is associated with *doing* more paid work, so attitudes about work matter very much in India &amp;amp; Bangladesh. If attitudes can be changed, this may facilitate more women doing appropriate forms of paid work, thus contributing to national income and lower levels of poverty.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5535CD70-2B4E-4945-9716-A417E642F113</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e160c33a4b38.35089293</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/gender-norms/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>A Long Training Lecture Presented to 25 Chinese officials on &amp;quot;Statistical Issues in the National Accounts and Measuring Capital Assets&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A9DDD80-E8CD-45DD-BA53-3309FA3615F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a long session of training to China's National Bureau of Statistics staff in 2014 when they visited Manchester in November.

The Human Development Survey was examined to get details of life satisfaction, paid work, household income, and earnings. These were broken down by sex. The training workshop enabled participants to link together the members of a family. Then we are able to carry out regression. The data is the only panel data set representing an All-India sample survey. We developed a dependent variable which reflected change over time in two years of the panel (two cohorts). This was an achievement and will enable more people to use these data.

Abstract: The method known as qualitative comparative analysis comprises a set of related case-comparative techniques for studying data that originates as case-wise qualitative, or otherwise detailed, evidence. If it starts off qualitative, the QCA stage involves systematically calibrating the data to fuzzy set or crisp set scores. If the data set is a secondary one with continuous variables, again these must be calibrated. I explain the calibration method, and how consistency is measured. I then augment these QCA techniques with a statistical F test of the result. The F test acts both as a hypothesis test and as a measure of goodness of fit of the data to the pattern predicted under either a 'sufficiency' or 'necessity' claim. The sufficiency claim is explored using empirical data from India. These data involve 450 female cases, mostly married and with spousal and household evidence available from a related primary research project. The outcome is whether they did remunerated work. The F test involves a comparison of the distance from sufficiency in a fuzzy set context, compared with the distance we expect under a null hypothesis. We found that having land and not having a husband were sufficient together (but not separately) for a woman to work. Users can get the Consistency and F test results (p-values) from either Excel or our online freeware. Wendy Olsen thanks John McLoughlin for his programming help in Python.

These have an average attendance of 12 including both senior and junior staff of Universities across Britain. The impact is closely targeted on Sociology and Politics lecturers only. They become convinced that having more social data in their teaching is both feasible and desirable. We are conducting an evaluation of the degree to which they feel, on entering our workshops, that this is important. We also evaluate the impact on students at the University of Manchester (report to follow in 2015).
