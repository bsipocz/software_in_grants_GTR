The lack of diversity in British theatres is highlighted in a 2014 Arts Council England report, stating: 'It is vital that the arts and cultural workforce becomes more representative of the society it serves' (p. 1).
 
This two-year project argues that translation has a key role to play in fostering equality in the performing arts. In order to make British theatres attractive to, and representative of, a more diverse audience, this project proposes to further, and widen awareness of, existing debates on the ethics and politics of translation among practitioners, industry professionals, translators, audiences, students and scholars. At a time when immigration is at the centre of the political agenda and nationalist, anti-European sentiments are on the rise, theatre translation and the representation of otherness on stage can offer a public arena for intercultural dialogue. 
 
The Fellow aims to carry out research and public engagement activities that place the politics of translation and the representation of otherness through theatre in the public eye. The research will investigate questions such as: What are the current dominant translation/adaptation strategies in theatre? What constitutes a 'foreignising' approach to theatre translation/adaptation? Can the same approach work for different kinds of sources? What are the effects of 'foreignisation' on performance and mise en sc&amp;egrave;ne? How is a 'foreignising' translation draft negotiated by theatre-makers in the rehearsal room? How do audiences respond to it? 

Translation scholar Lawrence Venuti champions the translation strategy he calls 'foreignisation', as a as oposed to 'domestication', in that the former tries to limit the degree to which the unfamiliar is forcibly turned into the familiar, silencing cultural difference. Despite the recent academic interest in 'foreignisation', theatre studies still lack a debate on what a 'foreignising' approach to stage translation would mean for text and performance, and whether theatre - as opposed to literature - requires a distinctive approach. The question of how current theatre training and ideological beliefs influence translation practices in British theatres is also underexplored, and so is the notion of a 'foreignising' approach to adaptation. Meanwhile, the theatre industry tends to take 'domestication' for granted in an attempt to appeal to the widest possible audience, dismissing 'foreignisation' as a clumsier, riskier, yet untested alternative. 

The Fellow and her collaborators will select three plays for translation by playwrights based in Europe and writing in Polish, Spanish and French - representing three of the most spoken European migrant languages in the UK - and organise practice-as-research workshops with professional performers and creative collaborators, led by scholar-translators, to test 'foreignising' strategies. The Fellow and her Research Associate will carry out qualitative research during and after the creative process with performers and audiences. 

Each workshop will present their outcome to the public in the form of rehearsed readings at the Gate Theatre in London in May and June 2016. Each performance will be followed by a post-show debate. Taking place in the run-up to the in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU during what will be one of the most crucial political debates of recent times, the Fellow aims to widen the reach the project by working with our consultants, Firehouse Creative Productions, to develop one of the plays into full production for the Edinburgh Fringe in 2017.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project seeks to make an impact on the following constituencies:
 
1. Theatre industry (managers, programmers, producers, practitioners, translators, etc.)
The proposed project is founded on the collaboration between theatre academics (the Fellow, Advisory Board members, the RA and the scholar-translators) and theatre industry players (our consultants Firehouse Creative Productions, the Advisory Board members, directors, performers and so on). The project is therefore ideally placed to make an impact on those working in British theatres and aims to concentrate its efforts in this sense, while at the same time cultivating impact on other communities mentioned below. Our impact on the theatre industry will be sustained through a series of different activities:
 
a. Advisory Board. The establishment of an Advisory Board - comprising both academics and individuals in key industry positions and meeting at several stages during the project - will encourage the exchange of ideas among Board members around the industry's current practices on theatre translation and how they can be improved. This awareness can then trickle down to their colleagues.

b. Workshops. The rehearsal workshops will provide the opportunity to foster an engagement with practitioners, namely performers, directors, designers, producers and translators.

c. Rehearsed readings and post-show discussions. We will organise open performances to showcase the outcomes of the project in our partner venue, the Gate Theatre in London, and arrange for post-show discussions to be moderated by young theatre critics working primarily for online publications in order to maximise our presence on social media. We will make direct contact with industry players through our Advisory Board and invite them to our staged readings.

d. Publications and blogs. In order to disseminate the ideas and outcomes of the project to the general public, the Fellow will set up a dedicated website, where blogs by herself and other participants will be published during and after the creative process. The Fellow will aim to get the project covered in industry journals, such as The Stage, and in theatre reviews websites. A 'foreignising' manifesto will appear in an established website, such as Exeunt Magazine.
 
2. Cultural policy-makers and theatre programmers
Aspects of this project will be of interest to cultural policy-makers specializing in equality and diversity, and publications arising from this project might feed into the next ACE report on equality and diversity in the arts. The publication of the 'foreignising' manifesto will make a case for theatre translation as an ethical imperative, and 'foreignising' strategies as one possible approach to enhance diversity and representation in British theatres.
 
3. Theatre spectators from both British and migrant backgrounds
Spectators of the project's outcome performances - both in their rehearsed reading and full-blown stage of development - will be able to experience plays from major non-British theatre cultures, which would otherwise not have been accessible in English. Spectators from those contexts out of which the plays emerged will be able to see elements of their culture performed on stage in a professional British theatre.
 
4. Translated playwrights
Authors of the translated plays will benefit from international exposure on British stages, and the translation of their work into English will contribute to the circulation of their texts in other English-speaking countries. Our partner, the Italy-based online theatre publisher Cue Press, will publish the translated plays as e-books or print-on-demand at the end of the rehearsed workshops, and these will become available to download at a very competitive price all over the world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N005740/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E2F513B-B936-4DF8-B28D-0ADC57F8BFC7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropological Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2DB2E75A-C815-466B-A26B-60EB301AD722</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dramaturgy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E66DC80-F20F-4AC2-915A-AF46F5C6ED14</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interpreting &amp; Translation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4DC83A15-ACD4-4667-BA6F-2DB8EFCF166F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theories Of Theatre</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
