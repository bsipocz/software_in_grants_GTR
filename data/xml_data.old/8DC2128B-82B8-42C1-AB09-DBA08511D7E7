A confidential pathfinder report on the assessment of the commercial opportunities for a novel food ingredient with potential health benefits has been produced. Part 1 of this report contains the market and regulatory assessment (addressing objectives 1-3; see above); Part 2 contains the literature and intellectual property assessment (addressing objective 4). The report also includes recommendations for further work (business development plan) and a complementary patent strategy. 

The pathfinder project has identified several routes to market; however, it will be important to advance scientific understanding of ingredient functionality, in order to identify the most suitable products and work-streams to achieve successful commercialisation. 

Further funding (Objective 5) has been obtained through the BBSRC Follow-On Scheme and will enable the technology to be developed further in order to meet the business challenges identified by the pathfinder project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FEC3BAD6-A46B-4DD2-BFCC-182568046EF4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d71898eded62.69392772</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A confidential pathfinder report on the assessment of the commercial opportunities for a novel leguminous ingredient with potential health benefits has been produced. Part 1 of this report contains the market and regulatory assessment; Part 2 contains the literature and intellectual property assessment. The report also includes recommendation for further work (business development plan), which forms the basis for the Standard Follow-On-Fund application. The conclusion of these assessments was that there is a clear opportunity for the development and commercialisation of the proposed ingredient.

Overall, the funds invested in the Pathfinder project (2 months) have provided confidence that the proposed novel ingredient has a significant potential for successful commercialisation, and has provided direction and focus for further work. The identification of business challenges and key market trends has enabled a robust business-plan to be developed, which includes recommendations for further work to enhance the prospect of commercialisation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the BBSRC pathfinder report provides essential information that will maximise the chances of successful commercialisation of a novel food ingredient that will be of direct benefit to public health. Such an ingredient is likely to be of benefit to the general public with regard to supporting the dietary prevention and management of diabetes and obesity. 

A BBSRC-funded Follow-On project is already well on the way to demonstrate the capacity to produce the proposed ingredient on an industrial scale, and further experimental work is expected to confirm the novelty and functionality of the ingredient.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>505FD49C-D78D-4B46-8DA4-1EFE63266D1A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56a64683a01053.93394303</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M005593/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
