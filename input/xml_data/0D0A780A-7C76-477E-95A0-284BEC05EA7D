Improving access to specialist palliative care is a major aim of the NHS Cancer Plan. Some data suggest that older cancer patients may be less likely to use specialist palliative care, giving rise to concern about equity and bias. However, research into the fair distribution of healthcare is dependent on both accurate service utilisation data and on the precise definition and measurement of need. More rigorous methodological approaches are needed to examine whether treatment decisions are made solely on the basis of need, and whether clinical judgement is influenced by prejudicial notions about patients.
Research Aim
To examine the extent to which the use of specialist palliative care services for older cancer patients varies according to need.
Research objectives
1. To formulate indicators of need for specialist palliative care services.
2. To conduct a prospective cohort study to measure the use of specialist palliative care services in younger versus older cancer patients, in relation to need.
3. To examine demand and supply side factors influencing referral to and uptake of specialist palliative care services in older cancer patients (aged 65 and over).
Methods
(1) A systematic literature review and critical appraisal of health-related quality of life measures will be conducted. Semi-structured interviews will be undertaken with consultants and clinical nurse specialists in palliative care, examining the contribution of physical, emotional, social and functional domains in defining need for specialist palliative care. (2) A prospective cohort study will be conducted within one cancer network. Lung cancer patients recruited from outpatient clinics will be followed up every two months. Service use and need will be assessed with a piloted questionnaire including a psychometrically validated health-related quality of life measure. Multiple variable logistic regression will be conducted to analyse use of specialist palliative care services by age, after controlling for need. (3) Qualitative interviews will be undertaken with patients, carers, and healthcare professionals referring to or providing specialist palliative care. Interviews will focus on demand and supply side factors influencing clinical decision making behaviour. 
Collaborations: Staff within one cancer and palliative care system. Palliative care, statistical and health services researchers.
Scientific opportunities: (1). Development of robust methodological approaches investigating equity in palliative care, including the measurement of need. (2) Greater understanding of supply and demand side factors influencing variations in use of specialist palliative care services. (3) Peer-reviewed papers disseminating findings</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2004-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>266995</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>638912A6-12D7-4D31-83E4-3FFC1730E918</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effect of age on referral to and use of specialist palliative care services in adult cancer patients: a systematic review.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Age and ageing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/36ad7a3c55fd8dae2d0c2ba65c27418b"><gtr:id>36ad7a3c55fd8dae2d0c2ba65c27418b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burt J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2006-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-0729</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>3714460B9AC</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G106/1193</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
