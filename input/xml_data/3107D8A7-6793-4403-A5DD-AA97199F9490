Whilst white blood cells are critical for our lung defences against infections, it is recognised that in COPD the persistence of white blood cells is linked with irreversible lung damage. Neutrophils are one of the first white blood cells to reach the lungs when an infection develops and they have an essential role in killing bacteria, but their subsequent removal from the lung is critical for preventing lung damage. It is also recognised that some patients with COPD get frequent lung infections and these patients deteriorate more rapidly. Both the onset of infections and the progression of COPD are associated with a reduced ability of the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air we breathe into the circulation and tissues where it is used. It is currently unknown whether this reduction in oxygen causes more rapid progression of lung damage and/or affects the body's ability to fight off lung infections. We do know, however, that a lack of oxygen affects how neutrophils function, in particular the ability of neutrophils to die in a programmed and relatively safe manner. 

This research proposal focuses on whether low oxygen levels can determine outcomes of lung infections. It is known that all cells in the body detect and respond to different oxygen levels through regulation of a pathway called the HIF pathway. I will use model systems to study whether oxygen levels determine how efficiently infections are cleared from the lungs and whether the the amounts of HIF proteins affect this. 

I will also investigate whether patients with COPD have different levels of key components of this HIF pathway in their neutrophils, compared with those of healthy people or of smokers who do not develop COPD, and also whether the levels of individual HIF pathway members regulate their susceptibility to lung infection and inflammation.

These data we hope will provide a platform to allow us to develop programmes aimed at finding new treatments for COPD and to test the utility of potential therapies for chronic inflammatory lung disease. To date there is little effective treatment for some of the most common inflammatory lung diseases, typified by COPD. Consequently, they remain a significant disease burden to society as well as for patients themselves. If we were able to shed light on some of the basic molecular events that determine how long neutrophils persist in the the inflamed lung this could help in the development of effective anti-inflammatory strategies that are so desperately needed for the effective treatment for these common and disabling chronic lung diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>COPD represents a significant burden of disease world wide, yet the cellular pathways determining disease progression remain poorly understood. It is recognised however, that patients who have frequent infective exacerbations of respiratory symptoms have a worse prognosis and that abnormal gas exchange is often observed either acutely during an exacerbation or chronically as the disease progresses. The role of systemic hypoxia in determining disease progression, susceptibility to pulmonary bacterial infections and persistent inflammatory responses has yet to be addressed. 
The key goals of my research proposal therefore are to: 1. Characterise the effects of systemic hypoxia on outcomes of acute pulmonary infections using murine models of bacterial pneumonia. 2. Investigate the role of HIF oxygen sensing pathway members in determining bacterial clearance and myeloid cell mediated inflammation in acute pulmonary infections. 3. Define whether systemic administration of hydroxylase inhibitors can modify susceptibility to and outcomes of acute bacterial pneumonia in mice in the context of hypoxia. 4. Determine whether ventilatory failure and infective exacerbations modify neutrophil expression of HIFs and dioxygenase family members in patients with COPD. 
Through a better understanding of these oxygen-regulated signalling pathways, I hope to identify specific targets with potential to limit inappropriate inflammation whilst preserving anti-microbial responses.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>A significant burden of disease can be ascribed to a group of lung conditions including COPD characterised by persistent and inappropriate neutrophil activation, systemic or localised hypoxia and
bacterial colonisation. To date, no effective strategies exist to selectively target persistent neutrophilic inflammation, whilst maintaining a fully competent innate immune response. I propose that hypoxia is a critical regulator of neutrophil function and can control the neutrophil phenotype to independently influence pathogen clearance and injury resolution. Through a better understanding of these pathways we aim to identify novel therapeutic targets that will enable the development of context specific therapeutic approaches to selectively target persistent neutrophilic inflammation, currently a major unmet clinical need. This work will extend knowledge both within the fields of oxygen sensing, host defence and have clinical relevance to patients with chronic inflammatory lung disease. In this context the Walmsley laboratory have generated data that has already been of interest to the pharamaceutical industry, with whom they are currently proposing to study the consequence of selective PHD deficiency on smoking related lung disease through the use of murine models. 

The extension of local and national collaborations required to facilitate the delivery of this proposed work, in addition to advancing our understanding of the importance of the oxygen sensing pathways in disease, will provide me with unrivalled access to training in inflammation biology and hypoxia in an environment in which training is routinely being provided to biological and medical scientists at undergraduate, doctoral and post doctoral levels. It will also enable me, through links with local schools and a welcoming laboratory group, to become actively involved in the exposure of school pupils to a scientific environment, motivating them to consider this type of work in the future, and re-enforcing its greater societal importance. 

In summary, I propose that this work, through the advancement of existing knowledge, and the dissemination of knowledge and training to both academic, business and school beneficiaries will contribute both to the economy and society in general. The long term aim being to provide a platform in which we can develop novel therapeutic programmes for the treatment of chronic inflammatory lung disease.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159874</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>95CD0927-FD79-48EF-8339-885037C4707A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mutations in succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) enhance neutrophil survival independent of HIF-1a expression.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Blood</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/80b6fa8bab35a059b42c83d6782298a1"><gtr:id>80b6fa8bab35a059b42c83d6782298a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-4971</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>589492547ca5e5.29443649</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>83AF4AC2-632B-42BF-8528-0118C5645572</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hypoxia determines survival outcomes of bacterial infection through HIF-1alpha dependent re-programming of leukocyte metabolism.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a59e42e9d22616597037c27e2e8b3dbf"><gtr:id>a59e42e9d22616597037c27e2e8b3dbf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thompson AA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2470-9468</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bd5353c56366.15343238</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K023845/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
