This technology has already been used for over 100 professional events, including the Pinsent Mason Conference at the Tower Hotel in 2015 as a wearable badging solution enabling delegates to exchange details as to whom they met etc. It is currently being further developed to act as an electronic business card, pager and corporate badging solution ? these are all relevant to the hotel industry
This project is to adapt and develop our low power wearable technology to enable it to further improve the guest experience and the efficiency of staff, and which also offers hotels the opportunity for enhanced branding.
Specifics include three main strands:
1) Guest experience, this will be a uniquely branded, low cost, but highly functional, room key with an e-paper display and connection to hotel network and mobile phones. The key will have the ability to store picture of the guest, name, room number and signature ? only exposed if tapped with staff or hotel equipment. This can be used for navigation to room or hotel facilities, open room doors. As guests move around the hotel they can get notifications of events in the hotel. Payment within hotel and with partners. The key can be found if lost. We have the hardware components to make a physical key, but would have to create the application software
2) Staff management, this will be a wearable gadget, probably a lapel badge for men, or a wrist band for women. This wearable device will have the ability to show a staff picture and name, message alerts and a to do list from management. It can track where staff are subject to privacy concerns. We have the wearable hardware complete but need to create the software applications to provide real-time workforce management.
3) Management of events, conferences etc. ? our new e-paper badge is being used by conference organisers and at the moment does not need any connectivity to give basic capability.

In all cases our proposed wearable technology will enable location of people in rooms and their accounting in cases of emergency - a fire and safety issue in many complex buildings such as hotels.
We believe the technology we will be developing for the hospitality industry could also be used in the other challenges in this grant namely healthcare, clothes, safety and interactive toys ? as it will be so intuitive and simple to use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39600</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">230002</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
