It is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 100 children and is characterised by a range of behavioural excesses and deficits in the areas of social imagination, communication and social interaction. These behaviours often pose significant challenges to parents or caregivers and affect the development of positive and adaptive skills.

A number of approaches exist that aim to reduce such socially challenging behaviours while increasing socially significant ones. The most notable evidence-based approach is Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). Using the core principles of ABA, Behaviour Analysts (BAs) aim to increase/decrease behaviours through a process of understanding the events that occur before and after a behaviour. By understanding these events (the function), procedures can be implemented, which attempt to modify the behaviour. As a result, maintaing careful data collection are essential in order to identify the causes and effects surrounding behaviours. 

As the emphasis is on early intervention, children are usually of a pre-school age when they commence home-based intervention programmes. During these programmes, parents typically carry out their own behavioural collection procedures due to the predominant lack of availability and high cost associated with BAs. Subsequently, a typical care model involves parents taking a pivotal role in their child's development by 'learning' to deliver autism intervention programmes supported by home-based therapists, under the direction of a BA.

Although paper-based methods exist for supporting data collection, such records are commonly misreported. Reasons for this include the workload involved in implementing and coordinating ABA programmes that do not afford much time to record specific events as they happen and manual collection is cumbersome and impractical especially for those behaviours occurring outside of the home environment. Additionally, parents/therapists often find it difficult to accurately identify the triggers surrounding a behaviour. As a result, there is often missing/incomplete data, which in turn leads to delays in understanding the function of a behaviour.

As a consequence of the issues surrounding behavioural monitoring, a partnership has formed between the University of Ulster and PEAT, a Northern Ireland Autism charity dedicated towards supporting home-based autism intervention. Together, we believe that a Connected Health care model similar to that, which has been applied to support conditions such as dementia and chronic disease management can help to improve home-based autism intervention, particularly in the area of behavioural data collection and analysis. 

Using a clinically-led and user-driven design methodology we aim to investigate and develop a suite of ICT services. Specifically, we will build upon developments in smart-phone technology to provide a touch-based interface for parents/therapist that supports fast data entry. An underlying decision support algorithm will guide Users through the recording process, thus permitting the flagging of specific behaviours. Furthermore, a clinical web-portal will be developed to allow BAs to remotely assess the progress of ABA programmes and to respond to queries and provide feedback to the smart-phone users. Surrounding these services will be a central data repository to store all of the information recorded and linked to this will be a set of data mining algorithms which will inform BAs about any underlying correlations between behaviours and their respective causes and effects. In this way, we aim to provide a knowledge-base that will reduce the time required to determine the function of a behaviour.

Addressing this aim will allow the project to support improved compliance, accuracy and user satisfaction among all users and ultimately serve to promote improved autism intervention.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>If the objectives of the proposed project are met, the outcomes have the potential to offer impact within short-term, medium-term and long-term time-frames. 

In the short-term, therapists and parents will benefit from the computerisation of current paper-based data collection methods (ABC charts) for maintaing a record of observable behaviours. The current paper-based methods are both error-prone and cumbersome, thus leading to gaps in the data. The outcomes of this project will provide caregivers with a convenient method for recording and storing observable behaviours. Furthermore, the developed algorithms will offer an additional layer of support, which is not possible with paper-based methods. Specifically, parents and therapists will be guided as to the likely causes and effects of a particular behaviour through underlying association rule mining. This approach has been widely used in other domains for discovering correlation and patterns between different antecedent-consequences in large datasets, for example, in stock share purchasing, supermarket sales analysis and recommender systems. Many existing approaches are too complex for the target user group, going beyond the level of detail required to support home-based intervention. As a result, this project will focus on reducing the size of the result set returned by data mining operations by embedding domain knowledge within the algorithms utilised, thus leading to more intuitive, simplified user interaction.

In the medium-term, the outcomes of this project will be used to direct the treatment of children with autism. As previously stated, the identification of observable behaviours is key to successfully helping children with autism to develop their skills and improve their quality of life. Specifically, this project offers the potential to increase the speed with which observable behaviours can be identified and correlated to relevant antecedent (cause) information and resulting consequences (effect). In addition to the digital history that will be maintained through the provision of a data repository, this will offer the potential for improved examination of behaviour trends, which will be supported through the provision of querying and graphing functionality, delivered via a clinical web portal.

Within the long-term, this project will contribute towards existing products, such as SimpleSteps, which aims to provide families/therapists with basic skills for undertaking home-based treatment without the full-time support of ABA professionals. Indeed, given that the demands for home-based autism intervention far exceed the number of qualified ABA professionals, such such knowledge is necessary to support parent/therapists to record and appreciate the function for exhibited behaviours.

Finally, the successful development of decision trees to provide decision support will help guide parents to record relevant and accurate data while data mining algorithms will allow ABA professionals to observe trends in behaviour over time. Both of these advancements will enhance caregiver's / BA's treatment knowledge and streamline the intervention process thereby offering the potential for both societal and economic impacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98680</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Parents' Education as Autism Therapists PEAT</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PEATNI</gtr:description><gtr:id>D7346B6A-9BF5-4A5D-A5CE-EA81B04EAE64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a multidisciplinary collaboration that brought together researchers with backgrounds in data mining, user interface design and human computer interaction, with clinically practicing professionals from both psychology and behavioural analysis disciplines.

The collaboration with PEAT has been sustained and continues to develop through successful funding from Big Lottery Fund, UK. This new funding is being used to develop and evaluate a 'VirtualBuddy' smartphone application for supporting young adolescents with autism. This project embraces the notion of providing tools to help individuals self-manage their behaviour. It extends the findings from our EPSRC funded project (EP/K014420/1) through the provision of behaviour data collection services. This continues the collaborative approach adopted between PEAT and the University of Ulster, towards determining and realising a range of ICT-based tools for enhancing at-home autism interventions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5447cf3960e9d7.74122411-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>PEAT provided domain knowledge to guide the product design (service requirements and end-user expertise) through ongoing face-to-face meetings. They also supported requirements gathering, aligning these with the services offered by PEAT's award winning SimpleSteps product. 

PEAT's lead Behaviour Analyst provided support with the management of the clinical web-based portal throughout the user evaluations. Additionally, PEAT established contact with potential families, eligible for participating in the user evaluation and consequently, managed the registration of personal details and the hand-over of technology to evaluation participants. 

Finally, PEAT's Behaviour Analysts also directly participated in the user evaluations by: (1) providing input into the usability and user experience offered by both the web portal and the BMAC app - including participation in an eye-tracking evaluation of the web-portal to assess usability and; (2) providing clinical review (and validation) of the prediction results obtained from the implemented data mining algorithms.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Over the duration of the project, the research team at the University of Ulster provided ongoing advice towards increasing the organisation's (Parents' Education as Autism Therapists (PEAT)) awareness of technology and the opportunities that assistive technology can provide within the context of supporting autism intervention.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Belfast Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Steering Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C04AFD8E-EE1F-4DAA-8B90-5D06A82DD519</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This activity was used to share information and stimulate ideas surrounding the use of ICT-based techniques, tools and approaches that offer the potential to help individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and their caregivers. 

The event took place within three months of the confirmation of funding from EPSRC (EP/K014420/1). Consequently, this activity was used to gain important insight into the perceived stakeholder needs from a group of expert practitioners who have a remit to increase the effectiveness of current autism invention practice.

The outcome from this activity was a refined set of initial user requirements which was supplemented by bi-lateral email communications between the team at the University of Ulster and those experts serving on the Belfast ASD Steering Group, with a view to stimulate future collaboration.

The main impact of this activity was to increase the awareness of the Belfast ASD Steering Group about the opportunities and challenges for adopting and employing technology to support autism care, education and intervention.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5448fe1086e291.09508392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PEAT Family Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>098DE380-F58F-4FC4-A9CE-F013DC7D52EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 10 families attended an invited PEAT NI 'family day' where new and existing family's associated with PEAT come together to learn more about Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) intervention from PEAT's Board Certified Behaviour Analysts (BCBAs).

The annual conference attempts to bring together stakeholders from clinical, academic and industrial perspectives along with end users and family caregivers to explore how to utilise technologies to foster independent living and offer an enhanced quality of life.

The presentation, delivered by a member of the project (EP/K014420/1) team from Ulster University, outlined the primary findings from the user evaluations conducted and presented our investigation into the use of data mining for behaviour discovery within the context of autism intervention. 


Disseminating research findings at this international forum served to highlight and increase awareness of the Smart Environments Research Group at the University of Ulster.

So popular was the initial demand that the team was requested to deliver a second day of the course for additional interested participants. 

This particular event aimed to introduce ICT teachers to core concepts outlined in the new GCE Software Systems Development A-level Specification. The event structure required learning outcomes from the lecture series be linked with an increase in participants' understanding of both theory and practice. Eligibility to host this event was dependent on the host organiser having received previous funding from RCUK. 

Consequently, leveraging our funded research (EP/K014420/1), the Principal Investigator led the design and delivery of a course to teachers that focused on software engineering processes, mobile development, user interface design and applications of technology. The course demonstrated these concepts through healthcare related exemplars that primarily focused on technologies for supporting autism intervention. In undertaking the delivery of this course, the PI took the opportunity to invite nine new and experienced staff and PhD students from within the University's School of Computing and Mathematics to support the event; delivering seminars, providing tours of the research facility and supporting practical hands-on sessions that touched on the wide range of ICT-based topics typically experienced by undergraduates. 

During these two full day events, 28 teachers from 22 different schools across the province attended.

Questionnaire feedback from the event was extremely positive and the results from this have been fed back to the awarding body. Anecdotal feedback from the participants highlighted their improved understanding of both research and teaching priorities within the School of Computing and Mathematics at the University of Ulster. As such, the PI is hopeful that he succeeded in supporting the promotion of key research concepts to an important sector.

Several participants indicated that they would use my RCUK funded project (EP/K014420/1) as a case study with their ICT-based courses.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544901cfaa20b6.23060179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sciencelearningcentres.org.uk/cpd/ondemand/8b3bddd2-1a92-439e-9f87-a1cbe2bf5713/smart-environments-ict-and-software-systems-development/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MadeInNIConf</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>00CDB0A2-1070-4B50-84FD-8DB83492C54E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited talk was presented at the Child Care Research Forum Conference 'Made in Northern Ireland' conference, in Northern, in 2014.

Reviewing the short-term impacts, Behaviour Analysts (BAs), therapists and parents have benefited from the computerisation of existing paper-based data collection methods (ABC charts), used for maintaining a record of observable behaviours. Paper-based methods have been reported as being both error-prone and cumbersome, and often contribute directly to 'gaps' in the maintenance of complete data. The outcomes of this research have provided key stakeholders with a convenient method for recording and storing observable behaviours. Reflecting upon the achievements within the research, in terms of providing a fully operational connected health care model, the short-term outcomes have been successfully achieved. 

In addition, the research effort has implemented data-mining algorithms that provide an additional layer of support to caregivers and Behaviour Analysts, which were not easily interpreted from paper-based records. Specifically, association rule modelling has been employed to determine the antecedent-consequence relationship for particular behaviours, based on the population of data stored in the repository. The results from this analysis are visually represented within the web-portal in a manner that clearly presents links in behavioural causes and effects.

If used responsibly by BAs, in the medium-term, visualisation of these patterns offer the potential to accelerate home-based intervention by assisting BAs to identify those antecedent-consequence relationships that appear / predict rises in challenging episodes of behaviour. The identification and management of behaviour is key to successfully helping children with autism to develop their skills and improve their quality of life. By providing a digital history of a child's progress through the provision of a data repository, the project outcomes offers the potential for improved examination of behaviour trends, which are supported through the provision of querying and graphing functionality, delivered via a clinical web portal. 

Longer-term, the outcomes from this project will continue to feed into ongoing projects (please refer to Further Funding section) as well as supporting the opportunity to integrate with existing products, such as SimpleSteps. Given that the demands for home-based autism intervention far exceed the number of qualified ABA professionals, the provision of key-training, tools to provide improved monitoring of behaviour, while promoting the provision for ongoing remote support, is necessary to increase the capacity of parent/therapists to understand the evolving function for their children's behaviour. 

BMAC advances the toolset available to the existing service provision by supporting caregiver's ability to maintain detailed recorded of behaviour. Consequently, BA's treatment review can be based on quantitative metrics that help to streamline the evolution of home-based intervention, thereby offering the potential for both societal and economic impacts. The experiences gained from BMAC have been used to progress the development of LifePal; a new technology tool-set aimed at young people with ASD. LifePal promotes the self-management of emotion and task management as is currently (2015/16) being evaluated in the wild.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CAE9E467-CC87-4243-A19D-EAE37AD45985</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447bab5974f56.46563454</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research literature has consistently reported on the importance of early home based intensive behaviour intervention programmes for children with autism. Of central importance to supporting the ongoing assessment of a child is a systematic and rigorous approach to data collection. 

Consequently, this research aimed to introduce a low-cost, readily available assistive technology solution to improve upon existing paper-based data collection and analysis methods. Over a period of 16 months, the project adopted the notion of a Connected Health service (called BMAC) to support caregivers of children with autism and Behaviour Analysts (BAs) with the task of recording, storing, retrieving and interpreting behaviour data exhibited by their children.

To complement these core services, the project undertook an investigation into the potential benefits of employing data mining and decision support algorithms to facilitate the automated analysis of behaviour data. This research was undertaken with a view to identify and present correlations indicating relationships existing between particular behaviours and the associated causes and effects. 

The research project involved the participatory design and development of four core software components: (1) a smart phone app for use by parents / teachers and extended family to provide an efficient modality for recording behaviour details; (2) a clinical web-based portal where BAs and caregivers can gain access to previously recorded behaviour and visualise the data from different perspectives (based on incident rate, duration or behaviour causes and reported outcomes etc.); (3) a central anonymised data repository containing behaviour references with clinically validated cause and effect factors that can be downloaded by any registered user; (4) the implementation of a set of data mining algorithms to support the analysis and identification of patterns emerging from recorded behaviours in terms of their correlated causes and effects. 

The outcomes from this research have been realised through the delivery of a fully functional suite of technology prototypes. These prototypes have evolved over the course of two separate technology evaluations.

In the Phase 1 technology evaluations, six parents of children with autism were recruited to participate. Screening, consent and recruitment was supported by PEAT (Parents' Education as Autism Therapists); a Northern Ireland based autism charity that provided in-kind support to this research (please ref to collaborations and partnership section for more information). Each participant enrolled into the study was provided with a smart phone running the developed BMAC application. Initially, participants were invited to use a clinically validation paper-based method of data collection, routinely recommended for data collection at home, for a period and five days. Consequently, a second five-day period of data collection ensued involving use of the developed BMAC app. Following this 10-day evaluation period, participants were asked to complete post evaluation questionnaires, used to ascertain parent's perceptions on the usability and usefulness of the developed solution, and thereafter returned their devices to the researchers for off-line analysis of recorded data.

Feedback from participants highlighted that BMAC offered the potential to improve the overall process of collecting and maintain accurate behaviour data. Nevertheless, the use of technology was reported to have some limitations, for example, an inability to detail 'specifics' about a behaviour i.e. additional information on the event. Based on the feedback from Phase 1 evaluations, the BMAC prototype was evolved and the web-based portal infrastructure was prototyped. The web-portal was required for servicing the backend provision of the connected health care model. 

Phase 2 evaluations recruited participants (five in total) to engage with the BMAC application over a longer period of time. One of the main goals in undertaking a longer evaluation was to generate a sufficient volume of data to evaluate the data-mining component (to determine if behaviour correlations could be automatically identified) of the developed system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the data-mining and web portal components a short evaluation was also undertaken with BAs. BAs were invited to analyse 57 behaviour events, first using a paper based record and consequently, using the tools developed within the web portal. BAs reported that they were able to draw comparable conclusions from both approaches. Following this evaluation, the data-mining component was executed to produce a set predicted patterns emerging from the behavioural events. The BAs reviewed these results and reported that they would be sufficient to support them with the preparation of a behavioural intervention programme. The results from this work have been presented at the 12th International Conference On Smart home and health Telematics (ICOST), held in Denver, USA. Please refer to the Engagement Activities section for more information.

Overall, qualitative feedback from the evaluations undertaken over the duration of the project was positive and now serves as a catalyst for driving the technology towards a commercially viable product. Nevertheless, the research undertaken has a number of limitations mainly in relation to the duration of the evaluations and the small numbers of participants involved. As such, it is not possible at present to determine if the developed BMAC technology offers real potential to accelerate autism intervention. 

Through consolation of the experiences gleaned from this project, combined with outcomes from previous research projects that employed technology to support individuals with cognitive impairments and other chronic diseases, a technology roadmap has been drafted for publication. The roadmap provides a key set of recommendation for future development of assistive technology to support caregivers with delivering home-based autism intervention.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Collaboration with the local Northern Ireland autism charity (PEAT) has resulted in funding being awarded (Big Lottery Fund, UK) in order to support the development of self-management application for young individuals with Asperger's. The strength and maturity of the collaboration is directly linked with this RCUK funded project (EP/K014420/1). As part of our commitments to Big Lottery Fund, we have committed towards delivering a personalised version of the connected health BMAC service, which is further tailored (from a usability and user experience perspective) to the needs of young people who are themselves able to record details of their behaviour episodes. This will be realised through a mobile life-logging service.

Through continued collaboration with PEAT, exploitation of the services provided by BMAC will be examined, leveraging PEAT's SimpleSteps product. SimpleSteps provides a series of materials to support parent / therapist education. Specifically, SimpleSteps (available as both online and offline versions) aims to teach parents about home based ABA intervention through step-by-step processes using information leaflets, instructional videos, case study reports and through the provision of downloadable resources. SimpleSteps is now available in seven different languages (German, Norwegian, Spanish, Portuguese, Icelandic, Swedish, and Dutch). It has always been envisaged that the outcomes from this project would be used to build upon this model and, in collaboration with PEAT, future activities will plan to leverage upon the success of SimpleSteps in order to market and generate awareness for the suite of ICT services that will be developed. To support this, the project team are exploring the possibility to acquire funding for a Proof of Principle project, supported by the University of Ulster's department for Research and Innovation. This effort is still underway.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E1B7CC23-CFAD-46BD-95A8-C92DC94397A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447b5ca578bf3.60368673</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://193.61.148.237/~e10426674/BMAC/WP/index.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A database has emerged from our research that contains an anonymised data repository. At present, the repository contains approximately 500 events, obtained during a set of user evaluations, which involved parents and young children with autism. Each 'event' represents a description of an observed behaviour as well as the assumed/recorded antecedent and consequence associated with the behaviour. Other parameters such as the location, caregiver, duration of the behaviour, frequency, and time of day was also recorded. These data are all captured using the technology emerging from our research (EP/K014420/1).

Open access to this anonymised data repository is available to all registered users.</gtr:description><gtr:id>23C0306C-F583-4F12-ADDC-BA4D4EB52B81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From this dataset, it has been possible to apply data mining techniques to discover patterns emerging from behaviour data with regards to associated antecedent and consequences. 

The preliminary evidence suggests that 'rules' generated through the application of association rule modelling are sufficient to enable Behaviour Analysts (BAs) to prepare a new behaviour intervention, without the need to manually assess all of the raw behaviour data collected. We have undertaken an initial validation of these findings by recruiting two BAs to undertake a manual blinded assessment of raw behaviour data in order to assess the behaviour profile of a specific child. We compared the observational reports of two BAs with results obtained by the data mining technique. Consequently, the BAs provided qualitative assessment of the results, which confirmed that the association rule models, developed through this research, were able to identify and highlight the associated causes and effects for particular behaviour(s).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544920845e7464.06351256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>BMAC_Repository</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://193.61.148.237/~e10426674/BMAC/WP/index.php</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The BMAC smartphone application facilitates the recording of behaviour data, the reviewing of that data and the receipt of messages from the families Behaviour Analyst (BA). Developed for deployment on the Android platform, the current application allows quick data collection of common behaviour Antecedents, Behaviours and Consequences, as detailed within SimpleSteps Forced Choice ABC charts [Available: http://www.simplestepsautism.com]

The users of the application can indicate the person recording the behaviour and the setting in which it occurs. In the situation where multiple children within a family have autism spectrum disorder, the application allows the caregiver to select the child that exhibited the behaviour being recorded. Users are then requested to highlight from a predefined (clinically validated) list of Antecedents, Behaviours and Consequences, which are displayed as a scrolling list that can be navigated using simple 'swipe' gestures. If an Antecedent, Behaviour or Consequence is not available from the list the user has the ability to access and submit free text entry. After selecting the events from the lists, the Behaviour specific details are selected and include the duration, intensity (scale of 1-5) and frequency of the identified behaviour. As it may not be possible for the user to record the event as and when it occurs, the system allows the retrospective time stamping of collected data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6010D997-2EB0-4AEE-BD89-0CF7F590190C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To date, the developed software has only been evaluated with a small user group of parents. They have used the prototype to maintain a digital record of daily behaviours, exhibited by one or more of their children. 

Qualitative feedback (please see key findings description section) supports envisaged benefits of use of this tool as an interactive assistive technology for streamlining and augmenting data collection procedures within the home environment and / or other pertinent environment, such as the classroom. 

Initial findings from this research have been reported at the 12th International Conference On Smart home and health Telematics (ICOST), held in Denver, USA.

While BMAC focused on delivering tools to support parents to record observable behaviours, this new technology promotes a self-management paradigm by encouraging young people with ASD to take responsibility to recognised and record their own behaviours. 

There is growing recognition of the need for effective intervention and support to reduce the risk of children and young people with ASD from being excluded from society and in particular from education. This follow-on research is investigating contemporary approaches for providing 'virtual' support to young people with ASD that will complement existing approaches, which enable self-management and 'self-coping' with everyday challenges.

The service is based around a smartphone App that provides users with task management, life-logging, reminding, and travel support. The App is supported via a dedicated web portal that promotes collaboration between caregivers and their dependents, towards defining obtainable life goals.</gtr:description><gtr:id>08613EED-D5E5-4AC4-9656-D926DF8255F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based on the feedback from 20 participants (4 parents (Phase one), 8 child-parent groupings (Phase two)), the findings positively support the potential utility of LifePal, however, highlight the importance of delivering sufficient user training to support adoption and the need for longitudinal evaluations.

Among the most highly rated features were both life-logging and the rewards service which included the facility to generate a personalised contract between the parent and child. Another interesting observation was that younger users found the App easy to use while parents reported a learning curve associated with the web portal. In terms of qualitative feedback, parents praised the concepts of the platform, high-lighting the advantages of delivering services via technology in comparison with paper-based approaches. They also indicated that LifePal added structure to their child's day, allowing them to know what lay ahead and provided them with a safe space to life-log in a non-verbal way.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc611fe76e24.21292855</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>LifePal</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This web portal allows Behaviour Analysts (BAs) and parents to review recorded behaviour data, over time. (please refer to 'BMAC_app' section in Software and Technical Products). Consequently, BAs can interpret and action upon a functional analysis of these data in order to implement new / modified interventions. The web portal is linked with a data-mining component (please refer to section on research databases and models), which is used to extract patterns occurring within the recorded data, based on the application of association rule mining to link data attributes.

The data collected is visualised using appropriate charts, graphs and text in order to provide summarised and structured information to users, to assist with highlighting behaviour correlations associated with varying environmental causes and effects. Furthermore, the web portal is also used to support communication between BAs and parents via the BMAC mobile application at home. This can be general information relating to autism, specific guidance about a particular intervention procedure and / or other useful information/ links as well as personalised intervention direction, pertaining to observations made through the web portal. As a result, this component of the system endeavours to augment traditional and on-going face-to-face interactions between BAs, parents and children rather than serve to replace them.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A1691247-2BDF-491A-BC98-BE51690F8270</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The developed web tool automates many of the manual processes currently employed by parents and Behaviour Analysts (BAs) within a home-based autism intervention setting. Specifically, the tool provides instant visualisation of recorded data through the provision of a user driven user interface that aggregates, summarises and showcases clinically important patterns in behaviour. These visualisation services alone offer significant potential for increasing BA's ability to discover behaviour patterns and to subsequently introduce more timely home-based intervention treatments. 

The visualisation service is further supported via a data mining service that highlights (based on the application of association rule modelling) the 'predicted' causes and effects of particular behaviour by mining previously recorded data from one or more individuals with autism. The service, while requiring further validation through longer user evaluations to generate more data, has the potential to reduce the workload of BAs by supporting them with functional analysis of a child's behaviour.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544e21aa640f82.43694435</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>BMAC Web</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://193.61.148.237/~e10426674/BMAC/WP</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K014420/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
