In all cases the early detection, or sensing, of change is paramount. One particularly important application of sensor development is in the field of CWA sensing. The highly toxic nature of the organophosphonate (OP) family of nerve agents and the potential for exposure to both military and civilian populations represents a real danger. Understandably, there is a clear requirement for adequate real-time detection capabilities for both military personal and civilian populations where advanced warning of exposure will help prevent casualties. 

Current analytical technologies for sensing organophosphonates, whilst being highly sensitive, have some clear limitations including complex instrumentation, inconvenient sample preparation, lack of portability, and high cost. These drawbacks somewhat hinder the development of cost-effective field based portable devices that are easily integrated into personal protective equipment (e.g. smart textiles) and non-invasive detectors for use in public areas.
One approach that has been developed to overcome these problems is to measure signal change through interaction with responsive materials that undergo changes in chemical, electrical, optical or magnetic properties on exposure to chemical derivatives. Luminescence as a responsive medium for general sensor development has received significant attention and in particular some elegant luminescent supramolecular systems have been developed over the last 5 - 10 years for the detection of CWAs and their mimics. The majority of these have been solution based sensors (this limits the use in devices - solutions are inconvenient to store, often suffer from instability and sample preparation can be troublesome - see above), and with field based applications in mind, there is a need to move from solution responsive systems to surface immobilised receptor-reporter based sensors. This represents a significant gap in the field as luminescence sensing offers an attractive medium for immobilised sensors with potential to develop small portable devices from simple components. As such, we will use an alternative approach to overcome some of the above drawbacks. By utilising thin film (mono-layers) lanthanide based sensors where the sensor is deposited (immobilised) onto a surface (using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique) and undergoes a change in light emitting properties on exposure to low levels of CWA mimics we will overcome the limitations listed above. Throughout this research project we will explore this alternative approach for selectivity and sensitivity towards CWA mimics and ultimately assess its applicability for inclusion into functional devices. Therefore, our approach of combining the superior photophysical properties of the lanthanides, and the control over deposition afforded by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique will generate designer lanthanide luminescent sensors that can be immobilised easily and reliably, potentially transforming the field of on-surface molecular sensing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We propose to develop new luminescent sensors for chemical warfare agents that are easily formed into thin films and hence have potential to be incorporated into functional devices. The proposed work has the potential to generate a number of types of impact.

Societal Impact. The long term impact of the proposed research is the development of new functional sensing devices for the detection of CWAs. With the ever present threat from global terrorism, it will be important to develop new sensor technologies for real-time sensing of CWAs and bio-hazards that pose significant risk to civilian and military populations. Additionally, there is potential for this research to be further developed for use in medical settings (e.g. highly sensitive sensors for point of care diagnostics and improved healthcare); environmental monitoring (e.g. pesticide detection/monitoring); and food safety (e.g. detection of poisons/toxic contaminants). 

Economic Impact. Research and development into new sensor technologies is an area of considerable importance not only within academic research institutions, but also in commercial and industrial markets which are worth over &amp;pound;3bn annually in the UK and &amp;pound;50bn worldwide. Additionally, the development of defence/homeland security based sensors is experiencing significant growth with the current world political situation. It is therefore vital that the UK retains a robust presence in this sector, something that will only be realised by being prominent in the area of targeted research leading to the generation of new intellectual property. The work outlined in this proposal will help to secure the economic health of this sector.

Technological and Commercial Impact. Immobilised mono-layers of lanthanide lumiphores with readily manipulated binding sites for a range of analytes have potential to be a highly sensitive sensing medium for small molecules (e.g. organophosphonate derivatives). They are therefore ideal materials for application in seing devices, suggesting that they have potential to make a significant technological impact as components in portable sensing devices (field based and non-invasive sensors), smart materials and smart textiles. The Langmuir-Blodgett deposition technique is robust, does not require significant substrate preparation, and can deposit films on a variety of substrate types and shapes, therefore sensors deposited onto surfaces by this method have the potential to be integrated easily into cost-effective portable sensing devices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99203</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cranfield University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>3D printed analytics collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>AA2AAEF4-F286-4D6F-B9A7-3967B01B4E9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None Yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c681d3e81e52.14575482-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners are designing the components and printing the prototypes based on observations made in testing.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are collaborating with partners at cranfield to design and test new 3D printed Brewster Angle Microscopes.

We have been able to synthesise responsive, luminescent, amphiphiles and then modulate their film formation through developing and studying mixtures of our designer luminescent amphiphiles with simple commercially available systems. This now means that previously unstable (and therefore unusable) films can be stabilised and can be deposited onto surfaces for potential sensing applications. This is an important discovery as it opens access to many novel films and potential sensors.
As a direct result of the research carried out we have started a collaboration to develop 3D printed analytical solutions to characterise surfaces. Specifically we have been working on the development of a 3D printed brewster angle microscope - prototypes have been developed and are currently being tested by us. This will allow fast and cheap characterisation of immobilised Langmuir films. This is an ongoing collaboration.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Those working in the field of thin film formation will find the results of interest as they show that functional/responsive amphiphiles can be immobilised onto surfaces for potential sensing applications. There will be interest from academic users as the new deposition methods will be applicable to other fundamental coating applications. The coating of substrates with responsive amphiphiles will also be of interest to non-academic partners as they are potential probes for inclusion into sensing devices.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A69884CF-7EA3-4CA5-8A17-6FB506480901</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b44f8fd4eb08.31468105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3AFFD2EC-48E3-4687-BC17-414E844C64BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigating the Structure Directing Properties of Designer 1,8-Naphthalimide and Amphiphilic Sulfonate Anions and Their Fe
