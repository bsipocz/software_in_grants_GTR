The proposed research is aimed at developing more efficient algorithms for executing common computations involving matrices such as solving linear systems, computing so called eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and many more.

The new algorithms to be developed are engineered from the ground up to work well in modern computing environments which look quite different from the hardware that was in use at the time when currently used methods were originally developed. Examples of such &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; environments include multicore CPUs, massively multicore GPUs (graphical processing units), computing on data stored on hard drives (so called &amp;quot;out-of-core&amp;quot; computing), or in the &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot;. In all of these environments, a key concern is to minimize communication, or the movement of data. This is in contrast to the objective of minimizing the number of floating point operations required, which used to be the key computational bottleneck.

Technically, the key novelty is that the new algorithms will rely on randomization to resolve certain communication bottlenecks that have hamstrung existing deterministic methods. The new methods will draw on recent work in mathematics and computer science involving so called randomized projections. In particular, the new algorithms can be viewed as extensions of earlier randomized techniques for matrix computations developed by the PI and co-workers. These existing randomized methods have proven to perform dramatically better than existing methods in many important environments, in particular when applied to modern huge datasets. The proposed research will very substantially extend the class of problems to which randomized methods can be applied.

An essential component of the proposed research is to develop mathematical theory that helps us understand properties of randomized projections. The theory will provide precise performance guarantees and will ensure that the research has a lasting impact. Moreover, many of the mathematical techniques that we develop will be helpful in developing methods based on randomized projections for problems that do not directly involve linear algebra such as clustering and nearest neighbor search.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will result in faster and more efficient algorithms for some of the most commonly occurring computational tasks within linear algebra. Such algorithms will have an immediate impact on competitiveness in the many industries that rely on computational simulations, such as harmaceuticals, defense, medical devices, finance, aerospace, etc.

The impact of the new algorithms will be the strongest on emerging technologies involving &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; such as image and video analysis, graph analysis of social networks, principal component analysis of large datasets of statistical measurements, search engines, speech and text analysis, and many more. In each of these fields, many of the key computational tasks involve matrix decompositions (typically of huge sparse matrices) that we believe are very likely to be greatly accelerated by the techniques we will develop. To put it differently, on any given computing platform (a phone, a personal workstation, a distributed memory parallel computer) much larger problems will be solvable using the available resources.

While we believe the most dramatic accelerations will be seen for huge datasets, the research will also lead to substantial accelerations of software for traditional computational simulations. The research will enable more powerful and accurate simulations in fields such as electromagnetic and acoustic scattering, wave guides, medical imaging, computational mechanics, modeling of composite materials, and many more.

To illustrate the potential impact of the new research, let us mention that highly optimized software packages for linear algebraic computations form a cornerstone of scientific computing. The perhaps most famous such package, LAPACK, has about one million direct downloads and many more millions of indirect downloads, since it is employed inside popular environments such as Matlab, Octave and Scilab, programming languages such as Julia or the statistics language R, etc. A core objective of the proposed research is to develop faster methods for some of the core functions inside LAPACK (column pivoted QR factorization, eigenvalue decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition, etc.) and we intend to release LAPACK compatible codes that implement the new methods. Ideally, we hope to even get some of these methods accepted for inclusion in LAPACK, in which case the impact of the research would be profound.

Finally, the project will improve UK competitiveness by further reinforcing a strong educational and research environment already in place at the University of Oxford. The research will interface with the doctoral training happening through the EPSRC funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling, and will also impact training at the M.Sc. level at Oxford. The role of computational simulations keeps growing steadily in traditional engineering areas, is growing fast in the biochemical and pharmaceutical industry, and is exploding in data analytics. The project will contribute to an excellent environment in which to train graduates with a deep understanding of mathematical and computational techniques required in this era of big data.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>336886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019215/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
