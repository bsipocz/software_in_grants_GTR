'Legal Epidemiology' refers to the use of epidemiologic methods and evidence to help resolve problematic questions of causation in law, most notably within the context of personal injury litigation. The project is a collaborative initiative led by a group of lawyers and epidemiologists from the following institutions: University of Birmingham (Dr C McIvor and Prof M Zeegers), Case Western University (Prof Sana Loue) and Maastricht University (Prof M Faure). 

Epidemiology is a core public health science that looks at the causes of diseases within human populations. Epidemiologists carry out a complex range of tasks to determine whether there is an underlying biological relationship between a particular risk factor and a disease. In addition to designing and executing studies to collect relevant data, they use various sophisticated techniques for interpreting the data and for determining whether any indicated statistical associations provide evidence of an underlying biological relationship of cause and effect. 
 
In dealing with certain types of personal injury claims, most notably medical negligence claims and toxic tort claims (ie claims for harm caused by exposure to a toxic substance), the courts routinely struggle with issues of causation. This is because such claims typically involve complex sets of facts in which there are numerous scientifically plausible explanations, aside from the defendant's faulty behaviour, for the harm that the victim has sustained and it is medically impossible to tell how the harm actually came about. In such cases, epidemiological evidence will usually constitute the most reliable source of causal information available. In addition to providing the courts with reliable information, epidemiological expert witnesses would also be able to provide guidance on how to interpret the information. (Epidemiological evidence often takes the form of statistics and the UK courts are unskilled in the use of statistics.) At present, however, the courts are generally unaware of the potential legal benefits of Epidemiology and so they rarely make use of it. One of the key objectives of the network is to therefore to publicise the legal value of Epidemiology and to encourage greater legal use of epidemiologic expert witnesses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By establishing Legal Epidemiology as a new discipline, and by raising awareness of the potential benefits of using epidemiological evidence in personal injury litigation, the network will most directly benefit: (i) claimants bringing personal injury claims; (ii) defendants defending personal injury claims; (iii) solicitors and barristers working in the field of personal injury law; (iv) the civil courts and (v) the Epidemiology profession.

At present, the courts struggle to determine questions of probabilistic causation in certain types of personal injury claims, most notably toxic tort and medical negligence claims. Such claims involve recourse to statistical evidence and lawyers (judges, solicitors and barristers) are generally unskilled in the use of statistics. A lack of trust in statistical evidence combined with a lack of knowledge as to how to properly interpret it has resulted in routine judicial misuse of statistics. Either the courts have rejected perfectly good statistical evidence (such as in McTear v Imperial Tobacco [2005]) or they have naively accepted inappropriate and unreliable statistical evidence and then proceeded to misinterpret it (such as in Gregg v Scott [2005] and Novartis v Cookson [2007]). The outcome of this misuse is that claims are often wrongly decided and such injustice affects defendants as much as it affects claimants.

Pharmaceutical companies, for example, are common defendants to compensation claims in respect of allegedly harmful side-effects of certain drugs and so they stand to benefit greatly from improved legal understanding and use of epidemiologic evidence. At present, companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer spend huge sums of money and invest considerable time in the investigation and defence of so-called toxic tort litigation.

By providing training to solicitors and barristers on the use of epidemiological evidence, the network will impact directly on the legal arguments and approaches to causation used by lawyers in advancing or defending certain personal injury claims. Longer term the impact of the research and its implementation is likely to be that weak claims will be discontinued at an early stage without having to proceed to trial while strong claims will be quickly settled, thus saving both time and money for all concerned. The prompt resolution of claims will also enable the parties to avoid the inevitable stress associated with protracted litigation. Where cases do go to court, the causation decision-making will be more evidence-based. Thus, the court discussions of causation will become more accurate and legal precedents on causation will become clearer and more defensible.

As a profession, Epidemiologists will obtain significant commercial benefits from the increased use of epidemiological evidence as this will involve an increase in work, both in terms of requests for the production of data as well as the provision of opportunities for taking on expert witness roles.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26734</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Plans to use findings as basis for projects to be undertaken by Statistics and Law Section of the Royal Statistical Society</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>61DA8DB0-CF2E-4584-9A91-F96E67D05C04</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dffc0ec86ee0.13405782</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There exists a considerable gulf between epidemiologists as producers of information and lawyers as consumers of that information. This gulf impacts most negatively on users of the civil justice system. If used accurately and appropriately, epidemiological evidence could transform legal thinking about causation and improve legal decision-making in complicated disease litigation.



In terms of addressing that gulf, the newly created International Association for Law and Epidemiology has identified a list of priority research projects:



1. The scientific and legal validity of the judicially-created 'doubles the risk' test of causation.



2. The dangers of using fixed risk values as measures of causation.



3. Reformulating tort tests of causation to accommodate multifactoriality and synergism



3. The benefits and limitations of using the Bradford Hill guidelines as a legal tool.



4. Defining 'expertise' and assessing the effectiveness of the current legal arrangements for appointing expert witnesses.



5. Issues of professional ethics for epidemiologic expert witnesses.



6. A evaluation of the respective UK and US approaches to pre-trial scrutiny of scientific evidence in civil litigation.



7. Professional legal training in statistics - viability and forms of delivery.



8. The potential legal applications of Bayesian paradigms.



9. Accessing data: unreliable databases and corporate withholding of negative trial results.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research will focus on the main conceptual, epistemological and practical issues underlying the law's current misuse of epidemiological evidence. The results of the individual research projects will be used to develop concrete guidance for practising lawyers and epidemiologists on how to use epidemiological evidence most effectively to determine legal questions of individual causation. Optimizing the use of epidemiology in such contexts will further benefit the wider public as potential users of the civil justice system by bringing about genuine improvements in legal decision-making about causation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>55E3D5DF-9165-453E-86CF-D0C3EA7F4558</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9731499543.163458777fd610</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.legalepidemiology.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K00235X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1F190F7B-B800-40B2-B250-62AD4842598F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioinformatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6F2E89E-46FA-4084-B88C-26D28FC989C6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Common Law inc.
