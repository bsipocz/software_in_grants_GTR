Milne Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Hull spans research areas from solar physics to the physics of stars, supermassive black holes, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the Universe as a whole. We study the growth and evolution of these cosmic structures as well as the production of chemical elements inside stars and the redistribution of these elements throughout galaxies and their environments. To this end, we use numerical simulations on local, national, and international supercomputers as well as astrophysical observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. Recently, we joined the 4MOST Consortium, building on our Builder Status within RAVE, and are key collaborators in the new TAIPAN survey. Our results from simulations and observations are combined through in-house synergies as well as intense collaboration with international colleagues around the world.

Our proposed projects broadly focus on the evolution of galaxies, one of the key challenges named in the STFC Science Roadmap. We study a variety of aspects of the internal physics of galaxies. These include the nucleosynthesis, i.e., production mechanisms of chemical elements, via the i-process in stars of different masses. We will employ computational chemistry to build a flexible and accurate theoretical framework to determine the vibrational signature of carbon-containing molecules adsorbed on surfaces (e.g., interstellar dust) from first principles. Our chemo-dynamical galaxy-scale simulations will show how chemical elements produced in the stars inside galaxies are redistributed and recycled in the next generation of stars. In an exciting venture, we will identify the locations within galaxies most likely to harbour complex biological life, addressing one of the fundamental questions facing humanity.

The evolution of galaxies is tightly linked to their external environments which can range from isolated galaxies to galaxies in dense groups or in massive clusters of galaxies. Thus, we will simulate the impact of a group environment on the chemical evolution of galaxies as well as the evolution of galaxies over cosmological timescales. One particular interest is to determine the characteristics of the cosmological habitable zone. Our observational survey data will test our understanding of active galactic nuclei, black holes buried deeply inside galaxies, by quantifying the properties of the active galactic nuclei for galaxies in different environments. In the course of our survey work, we will publish the Southern equivalent of SDSS of a large legacy to the astronomical community. The gas component of galaxies directly links to their environment. Galaxies in galaxy clusters pose a particularly interesting case where the galaxies' molecular and atomic gas, i.e., cold and cool gas (10-10,000 degree), is embedded in the 30 million degree hot cluster atmosphere. The interaction between this cool galactic and hot cluster gas is crucial for, both, the evolution of cluster spiral galaxies and for growth and outbursts of supermassive black holes in the central cluster galaxies, and is a focus of our proposed research. Finally, our goals include developing new classes of solutions in scalar-field cosmology. Our insights into the nature of inflation and dynamical dark energy will inform future high-precision experiments, particularly those designed to detect primordial gravitational waves.

Our research is decidedly cross-disciplinary in nature, with expertise drawn from astrophysics, mathematics, and chemistry. Our team combines world-leading experts in nucleosynthesis in stars and supernovae (Pignatari), computational astrochemistry (Benoit), galactic chemical evolution modelling (Gibson, Few), dynamics and gas physics in galaxy clusters (Roediger), extragalactic observations, surveys and galaxy evolution (Pimbblet), and cosmology and void statistics (Chongchitnan).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research proposed in this application has clear and present impact for academics working in the important areas identified in the STFC Science Challenges and the SFTC Roadmap. This applies to theory work and observations alike as our research aims to make a step change in our understanding of our own Milky Way, how it evolved, our own place in the Universe, and more generally how galaxies evolve over time and space. The results from our work will be disseminated in high ranking astronomical journals complemented with open-access versions, as well as seminars, talks and presentations at national and international conferences and venues. In terms of direct impact to professionals, astronomers and astrophysicists will gain significantly from the results that our research will yield through the robust testing of theories by confronting them with new simulation and observational data and providing a very large legacy survey of the southern sky. 

Beyond professional astrophysicists, the proposed research will be of high interest to professionals in working in the areas of chemistry, spectroscopy, and philosophers. Further than this, our results will be of benefit to teachers, outreach specialists and artists alike as the work will have high quality economic and societal impacts. This is especially true for the inspiration of younger people already in schools - and more so in a low economic area such as Hull - to fully realise their talents and consider furthering their skills through advanced education and thereby becoming highly productive members of society. 

In chemistry, our research will provide new understanding of how elements form and react not only inside stars, but in the early universe. The computational study of adsorbed molecules will also help further our understanding of how and why molecules aggregate onto dust grains. Spectroscopy will benefit from the abundance of new observations generated, coupled with a much deeper understanding of the theory of why specific elemental lines arise. Philosophers will be highly interested in the implications that our proposed research will have for the abundance, frequency and distribution of life not just within our own Galaxy, but within the wider Universe and cosmological context.

For teachers, our research will be disseminated via dedicated CPD events hosted by Hull University and arranged via our formal agreements with our local schools networked forged by our Ogden Science Officer.

In terms of outreach and art, our outputs from both simulations and observations have a very high aesthetic quality that can readily be installed in a variety of locations. Our current progress in this area includes installations at key locations (and times) within the Hull City of Culture calendar and on campus. The research will benefit from our outreach networks and will be written up for popular dissemination in outlets such as The Conversation and beyond.

Our record in engagement with the public has seen astronomy grow from essentially nothing to a wide-ranging influence in the local region wherein we directly exploit our connections with local schools to undertake outreach and have resulted in a 20% increase in applicants to our Physics with Astrophysics degree option -- the single largest increase across the Faculty of Science &amp;amp; Engineering. Additionally, have taken delivery of a world-class planetarium which will become a focal point for our outreach activities. We are responsible for coordinating the local branch of Cafe Scientifique, can be heard regularly on BBC Radio Humberside, and our contributions to The Conversation continue to enjoy considerable download rates. The Milne Centre's research underpins our activities for the Hull Science Festival, the Freedom Festival, Pint of Science, and our invited contributions at such events as the 2016 Cheltenham Science Festival and upcoming TEDx events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>683647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R000840/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B43E1E82-2962-4C36-87AD-95AC01BE0A9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6EE6184F-4A3C-4A99-A3AC-55FC62120A44</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Computational Methods &amp; Tools</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC478D98-EB7D-4905-B536-D9D61AFD07E4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Galactic &amp; Interstellar Astron</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6D4F9380-A853-4602-9383-3E0067A53A84</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stellar Astronomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
