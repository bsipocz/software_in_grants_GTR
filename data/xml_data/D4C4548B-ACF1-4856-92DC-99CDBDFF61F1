&lt;p>This study develops a novel FSW typology for the analysis of transactional sex risk in rural and urban settings in Indonesia. Mixed methods include a survey of rural and urban FSWs (n = 310), in-depth interviews (n = 11), key informant interviews (n = 5) and ethnographic assessments. Thematic analysis categorises FSWs into five distinct groups based on geographical location of their sex work settings, place of solicitation, and whether sex work is their primary occupation. Multiple regression analysis shows that the likelihood of consistent condom use was higher among urban venue-based FSWs for whom sex work is not the only source of income than for any of the other rural and urban FSW groups. This effect was explained by the significantly lower likelihood of consistent condom use by rural venue-based FSWs (adjusted OR: 0.34 95 per cent CI 0.13?0.90, p = 0.029).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The FSW typology and differences in organisational features and social dynamics are more closely related to the risk of unprotected transactional sex, than levels of condom awareness and availability. Interventions need context-specific strategies to reach the different FSWs identified by this study's typology.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85366</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder meetings with governmental and non-governmental AIDS organisations (incl.

The risk of HIV infection for women who engage in commercial sex is known to be influenced by many social and structural factors, including interpersonal relationships within and outside the sex work environment. These factors interact in many different ways to affect behaviours, such as use of condoms, choice and numbers of sexual partners, testing for HIV and uptake of antiretroviral treatment (ART), which play important intersecting roles in the transmission and acquisition of HIV infection. To date, little is known about the inter-related individual, social and structural factors that can influence HIV risk among epidemiological core groups, such as female sex workers (FSWs) in Indonesia, particularly among those working in rural contexts; and, in the eastern Indonesian islands, where case notification of HIV infection has increased in recent years. 

The main aims of the activities funded on this grant were: (1) To disseminate and develop findings of the grant holder's doctoral research on transactional sex risk among rural and urban FSWs in Indonesia; (2) to increase the grant holder's research capacity through specialist training and skills development; (3) to carry out exploratory research to identify and explain socio-structural drivers of HIV risk behaviour by FSWs in an urban venue-based setting in East Nusa Tenggara/Indonesia, with a special focus on the role of intimate non-commercial partnerships; and, to develop and test a combined qualitative and quantitative research methodology that can be used for future research of HIV risk behaviour by FSW populations in other settings; and, (4) to collaborate with others at the host institute - the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) - and beyond, to develop new research collaborations and secure funding for new research activities. 

(1) Using a mixed methods approach, the grant holder's doctoral research found that FSWs' socio-demographic positioning (i.e. marital status and educational attainment), inter-personal relationships at the workplace and structural factors (i.e. sex work setting and organisational features) are more closely related to the risk of unprotected transactional sex than levels of condom awareness and availability. In particular, the finding that married Indonesian FSWs included in the study were significantly more likely to use condoms consistently with their clients, than those who had never been married (adjusted OR: 3.47 95% CI 1.10, 10.94, p=0.033) deserves further research. 

The doctoral research findings were published in a peer-reviewed article: Puradiredja DI and Coast E. 2012. Transactional sex risk across a typology of rural and urban female sex workers in Indonesia: A mixed methods study. PLoS ONE 7(12): e52858. The findings were also presented at 2 national and 2 international conferences, including: Puradiredja DI. 2013. Mixing methods to optimise research on sexual behaviour among socially marginalised populations: lessons learnt from a study on Indonesian female sex workers. And Transactional sex risk across a typology of rural and urban female sex workers in Indonesia: A mixed methods study. Two conference papers presented at the International Union for Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP) conference, 26-31 August 2013, Busan, South Korea. Puradiredja DI. 2012. Unprotected transactional sex and socio-demographic characteristics of female sex workers in rural and urban Indonesia. Asian Population Association Conference. 26-29 August 2012. Bangkok, Thailand. Further, the results were presented by the grant holder at an invited lecture with the title 'HIV/AIDS - The disease and its determinants within the context of Indonesia' at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.

 (2) Building on the key finding of the grantholder's doctoral research that married Indonesian FSWs were more likely to use condoms consistently with their clients, an exploratory study conducted between June and August 2014, examined the role of intimate non-commercial partnerships in influencing HIV-related transactional sex risk among FSWs working in an urban venue-based setting in East Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia. Mixed methods include a brief enumeration survey of FSWs (n=126) and in-depth interviews with a sub-sample (n=10). Thematic analysis shows that (i) intimacy in relationships is constituted through interwoven affective and transactional elements and relationships are hence not entirely 'non-commercial'; (ii) participants experience intimate relationships in a range of ways, and both positively and negatively: positive aspects include the emotional and economic support afforded by these relationships and negative aspects include intimate partner violence; and (iii) condom use with intimate partners is sub-optimal as is testing for HIV/STIs among intimate partners. In methodological terms, this study successfully tested a combined mixed quantitative/qualitative research approach that can be used for larger-scale research of HIV risk behaviour by FSW populations in other settings. 

After maternity leave and re-location to Germany in 2015, a fellowship application will now be submitted to the ASC-IIAS Joint Fellowship Programme (http://iias.asia/page/asc-iias-fellowship-application) by 15 March 2016. This fellowship is jointly offered by the International Institute for Asian Studies (IIAS) and the African Studies Centre (ASC) in Leiden, Netherlands, and will allow the grant holder to publish the findings from her postdoctoral research on HIV/STI risk behaviour by Indonesian FSWs and to develop it into a grant application. 

(3) Alongside these main research activities, the grant holder was engaged in skills development activities (including training in systematic literature reviews, and specialist software packages NVIVO and ArcGIS), which were obtained at the host institute and applied in the field.

The expected submission date will be June 2017 to the target journals: Malaria Journal and Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine. 

(iv) Importantly, the latter research activity has resulted in an Australian Research Council (ARC) funded grant [AUS$ 460, 500] for a multi-site life course study on health and socio-economic vulnerabilities in Indonesia from 2017-2020. It is a collaborative research project by the University of Western Australia; Oxford University, UK; University of Southampton, UK and the University of Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. The grant holder is co-applicant and is responsible for the research site in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. This will give her the opportunity to continue investigating factors influencing health behaviours among vulnerable populations. Finally, the grant holder is now employed as Research Associate at the Bernard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM) in Hamburg, Germany the grant holder and remains affiliated with the LSHTM as Distance Learning Tutor for the MSc in Public Health programme at the Faculty of Public Health and Policy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project makes an important contribution to our understanding of HIV-related sexual behaviour, through its investigation of important but previously neglected determinants of HIV risk among female sex worker populations in Indonesia: the role of socio-structural factors, including intimate (non-commercial) partnerships. It provides innovative methodological approaches for the use in socio-epidemiological and demographic data collection and analysis, combining both quantitative and qualitative methods in one research design. 

The central implication of this research is that socio-structural factors, including intimate relationships, are important determinants of the well-being of FSWs in general, and HIV/STI risk and resilience in particular. As such, both FSWs and their intimate partners are worthy of being the focus of not only further research, but also of interventions aimed at supporting healthy intimate partnerships. 

More specifically, future research would involve extending the current study to include FSWs in different sex work settings (e.g. non-venue-based, rural) both within West Timor and the rest of Eastern Indonesia and beyond; and, FSWs' intimate non-commercial partners. In addition, planned future research would involve investigations of other socio-structural factors influencing timely issues, such as access to treatment and experience with treatment services. Examples of socio-structural issues to be explored include stigma and discrimination; domestic and intimate partner violence; and migration and sex work mobility, including in cross-border settings, such as the area along the Timor-Leste/West Timor border.

In methodological terms, another way to improve the existing evidence-base, is through greater use of mixed quantitative/qualitative methods in future research in this subject area. Proposed future research would involve implementing the current study at a larger scale in multiple sites in eastern Indonesia, and include the implementation of a behavioural and socio-demographic survey (as piloted in the exploratory study) among larger, more diverse samples of e.g. FSW, client, and intimate partner populations, in combination with qualitative research into socio-structural factors and processes, in the form of in-depth interviews. 

This study also has important programmatic implications for designing HIV/STI surveillance and intervention activities in Indonesia. National behavioural surveillance sites have to be extended to include a wider range of settings, including rural areas and the Eastern provinces, i.e. East Nusa Tenggara. Further, interventions need focused strategies across socio-ecological levels (e.g. individual, social and structural) to address not only FSWs and their clients, but also the general population, including FSWs' intimate non-commercial partners.

The grant holder has the opportunity to pursue a number of these and related research objectives as part of a collaborative Australian Research Council (ARC) funded multi-site life course study on health and socio-economic vulnerabilities in Indonesia from 2017 to 2020.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CC0B44DE-FA60-4293-8683-36D969F6ECD5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464c2ec429481.00108551</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6CAF5329-A2F2-4504-9538-65006C1CE82A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Development and evaluation of an online tool for management of overweight children in primary care: a pilot study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ open</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d733247bab805b712426ef55ce803560"><gtr:id>d733247bab805b712426ef55ce803560</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Park MH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2044-6055</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5448c4324cfde3.33004636</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C587B118-67FA-4E79-887E-2FE91A3E7755</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mixing methods to improve sexual behaviour research among socially marginalised populations: insights from a study on female sex workers in Indonesia</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9d69ee10b5d61b68626e87bb921fbbfb"><gtr:id>9d69ee10b5d61b68626e87bb921fbbfb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Puradiredja D I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546398098d6f12.09160143</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EC1FF4DC-66A7-4671-B346-24F59BF8A942</gtr:id><gtr:title>Factors Affecting Treatment-Seeking Behaviour in a Malaria-Endemic Area in Eastern Indonesia: a Cross-Sectional Study</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Malaria Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3caea0fc02f46e6f0aafdc4606381c75"><gtr:id>3caea0fc02f46e6f0aafdc4606381c75</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Puradiredja DI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e152dc937d82.87165490</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>923809AA-59B8-45D6-A167-8FC94335A2E1</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of socio-structural factors in influencing HIV risk behaviour among female sex workers in Eastern Indonesia with a focus on intimate non-commercial partnerships: An exploratory study</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>SAGE Open</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9d69ee10b5d61b68626e87bb921fbbfb"><gtr:id>9d69ee10b5d61b68626e87bb921fbbfb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Puradiredja D I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5463991ee6bec6.08015232</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>882BC39D-AB06-45A7-8D79-A1DF2F9B70BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Truancy and teenage pregnancy in English adolescent girls: can we identify those at risk?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of public health (Oxford, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/07c2a4af9f42a88efefb696767d62dd9"><gtr:id>07c2a4af9f42a88efefb696767d62dd9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhou Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1741-3842</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5448c55e4b3062.27675474</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>048D043E-9100-4CF7-9B65-5DCA7B977EE5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transactional sex risk across a typology of rural and urban female sex workers in Indonesia: a mixed methods study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3caea0fc02f46e6f0aafdc4606381c75"><gtr:id>3caea0fc02f46e6f0aafdc4606381c75</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Puradiredja DI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc01ac01af6ef96</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J004898/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp;
