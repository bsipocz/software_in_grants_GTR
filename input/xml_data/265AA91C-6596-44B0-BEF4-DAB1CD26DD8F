Impacts:

1. This will benefit UK agriculture by helping UK wheat to be more competitive with imported maize as an alternative feedstock for the Scotch whisky industry.

2. This will benefit the scotch whisky industry by making processing of wheat grain more efficient and thereby enhancing tax revenue to the UK government potentially by &amp;pound; 10s of millions per year.

3. A high value wheat variety which is intended specifically for distilling would encourage low N fertiliser use (since high protein is undesirable) with possible environmental benefits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61214</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Alleles identified have been taken forward into breeding for new wheat variety.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8C5DBCB8-2FEE-4A68-82F8-8CE1E47FC378</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58af13e08d1993.14431556</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Combining three homeoalleles for an IRX9 orthologue in a single wheat genotype results in a big decrease (&amp;gt;50%) in residue viscosity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The same homeoalleles are being incorporated into breeding streams by our industrial partner to make a new wheat variety with the low viscosity trait.
