More recently, relationships have also been reported between breastfeeding and other indicators of child development, including both cognitive outcomes (speech, reading, mathematical ability, etc), and non-cognitive outcomes (for example, social and emotional adjustment and motor skills). However, it is a well-known fact that the decision to breastfeed is not random but reflects mothers' characteristics and preferences. This implies that it is difficult to ascertain how much of the positive effect of breastfeeding is causal. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to isolate the true impact of breastfeeding from unobserved aspects of maternal behaviour using statistical techniques well known in economics and best suited to non-experimental settings. In particular the study will investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and a range of individual outcomes, including child cognitive and non-cognitive development, maternal rates of postnatal depression, and mother's return to work and absenteeism. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Unobserved differences in maternal behaviour or characteristics will be dealt with by using Instrumental Variables methods and Propensity Score Matching. The information on breastfeeding, child outcomes, and maternal mental health and labour supply will be derived from two large longitudinal datasets, the Millennium Cohort Study and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>192760</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Breastfeeding and cognitive development</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>92E6679F-2A59-4E6A-97BE-847006B14990</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of two different papers.

The second stage results indicate that breastfeeding has positive effects on health outcomes throughout early childhood. In particular, it reduces the incidence of severe vomiting and diarrhoea at 9 months and causes fewer asthma and wheezing problems at 5 years. The non-cognitive effects seem to be mainly concentrated in the first few months, with positive impacts on some aspects of the Carey Infant Temperament Scale at 9 months. By contrast, we find some significant effects of breastfeeding in the cognitive domain only in later years, as our results indicate a positive effect of breastfeeding on the BAS ability scale modules at 5 years.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2390530810.12380362aad713a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Breastfeeding and cognitive development</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>9D342515-7439-4C8B-A993-14CD4DC38031</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of two different papers.

Policy makers, such as Dr Poulter have taken on board this message and asked for support of breastfeeding policies in the local communities. By examining in great detail the effects of the UNICEF-UK Breastfeeding Friendly Initiative we have shown that hospital-level initiatives can have a strong impact on breastfeeding rates. This message was welcomed by the over 800 midwives and health professionals attending the Annual Meeting of the UNICEF_UK BFI. Moreover, it encouraged the UNICEF-UK BFI programme to continue its efforts to support breastfeeding at the hospital and at the community level .</gtr:description><gtr:id>82B926FB-01D4-489A-A80B-666EBF2BA8E1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc31a6c99b40.17002134</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research confirms the existence of significant positive effects of breastfeeding on children's cognitive development in early childhood and on educational achievements up to their teenage years. Importantly, the finding of a positive causal effect of breastfeeding on cognitive development is confirmed across three separate analyses using different definitions of breastfeeding, different methods and based on different data sets available for different time-periods. Borras, Iacovou and Sevilla-Sanz (Labour Economics, 2012) compare school test scores of breastfed and non-breastfed children in ALSPAC. After matching mother-child pairs on a wide range of observable variables, they show that breastfeeding affects children's test scores well into adolescence (age 7, 11 and 14 SATs). Del Bono and Rabe (ISER Working Paper, 2012-29) exploit variation in hospital participation in breastfeeding support policies (UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative) and find that breastfeeding has a large and significant causal impact on the cognitive achievement of the MCS children at age 3, 5 and 7. Iacovou and Sevilla-Sanz (European Journal of Public Health, 2012) find that schedule-feeding is associated with higher levels of maternal wellbeing, but with lower levels of later educational attainment, in a range of subject areas, at ages between 5 and 14. Other work emphasizes the benefits of breastfeeding to mothers and to employers. Borra, Iacovou and Sevilla-Sanz (Unpublished manuscript, 2012) explore causality in the relationships between breastfeeding and post-natal depression and find that this relationship is not robust to controlling for antenatal maternal mental and physical health. The study by Emilia Del Bono and Chiara Pronzato (ISER Working Paper 2012-06) shows for the first time that the availability of breastfeeding facilities at the work place reduces maternity leave spells of highly, but not low, educated mothers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has influenced economists interested in child development, in particular family and education economists. It has also had an effect on labour economists interested in worker retention issues as well as personnel and human resource experts. Our work has also been influential in the community of epidemiologists, in particular those interested in infant feeding and child development. For example, we have had positive feedback from Professor Yvonne Kelly and Professor Amanda Sacker as well as their wider research network at University College London. The findings of our research have demonstrated the importance of collecting more data about breastfeeding and about breastfeeding support policies. Three important initiatives are to be mentioned here. First, the team responsible for the UK Millennium Cohort Study is considering merging their data with hospital-level information derived from the National Sentinel Caesarean Section Audit. Secondly, the team responsible for the new Birth Cohort Study (Life Study) now intends to co-ordinate with the UNICEF-UK BFI programme in order to collect information on hospital and community-level breastfeeding support policies. Thirdly, new questions on infant feeding practices, including whether the infant is fed on demand or to a schedule, have been proposed in the breastfeeding module of the new Birth Cohort Study (Life Study) and are under consideration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6F888893-2AEB-44D3-878B-D0A88EE1F5E0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc31452b5b73.75062482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B8F081FB-D18A-499D-A579-795F330D182A</gtr:id><gtr:title>New
