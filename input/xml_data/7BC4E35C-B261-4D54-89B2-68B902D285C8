Moreover, the rate and magnitude of environmental change has been intensified by human activities. Therefore, a key task for understanding the dynamics of living systems, and for predicting the impacts of human activity on those systems, is to understand how ecosystems respond to environmental change. Two types of response can be considered. 1) Ecological. This entails changes in species abundances and distribution, leading to a different community structure before and after the environmental change. 2) Evolutionary. This entails genotypic change within species leading to their adaptation to the new conditions present after the environmental change. Despite considerable work on both types of response, typically they have been treated separately. Ecosystem studies have focused on ecological changes, whereas evolutionary studies have focused on single species or pairs of interacting species such as pathogens and hosts. Yet, most organisms live in diverse assemblages: inferences on evolutionary dynamics from such small systems may not apply in realistic settings. This project will address the fundamental question of whether species diversity tends to increase, decrease or not affect the amount of evolution within species. Our approach is to study evolution in the laboratory, using species of bacteria isolated from tree-holes of beech (Fagus sylvatica). These bacteria can be cultured in mixtures of different numbers of species in the lab, and have been used previously to explore the relationship between diversity and ecosystem function. By virtue of rapid generation times and very large population sizes, they also evolve fast enough to study evolution in species mixtures. We will assemble random mixtures of up to 24 species and expose them to environmental change, in terms of a shift in pH and resource type in turn. The evolutionary response of each species will be quantified using phenotypic assays and compared among treatments that differ in species richness and composition. Competition experiments between isolates from the same and different cultures will test for the occurrence of coevolutionary interactions. Bacteria have been widely used to test evolutionary hypotheses in vitro, but no previous studies have looked evolution in more than a pair of interacting species. The results will generate new conceptual understanding of the interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes in ecosystems facing environmental change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>385992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Uncovered - Natural History Museum (September 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>679FFBC7-47EE-4E46-8B35-4D325A4FA22A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science Uncovered is a widely-advertised and well-attended public outreach event hosted at the Natural History Museum in London, where scientist engage with the public face-to-face basis to discuss their research and its implications in an informal setting.

It seems obvious that how different living things in a community or ecological system bump up against one another would affect how they evolve. That would include everything from the mix of fish in a lake to the bacteria, fungi and insects that coexist in rainwater that pools in the roots at the base of a beech tree...

The design considered communities of 2,3,6, and 12 species of bacteria, as well as monocultures of each species, and with multiple species compositions for each intermediate level of diversity. We found that overall functioning of the community, measured as yield, changed over time as a result of evolution in the strength of species interactions. The effects varied between different novel environments. The work provided evidence for ecological effects on evolutionary outcomes that are applicable to multiple systems of animals and plants as well as bacteria. Published in ISME J. 2014.

2) Further analysis of the experimental results revealed how the growth characteristics of component species evolved in response to the presence of other species. Species in low diversity communities evolved to grow less well in isolation than their ancestors, because of a trade-off in adapting to the presence of other species. This effect declined as species richness increased. Again this provides experimental data to predict how species might evolve in response to environmental change, and how that is affected by species interactions - a ubiquitous feature of real communities. Published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 2015. 

3) We focused on one particular community of four bacteria species to demonstrate that species interactions evolve to be more positive over time, because of changes in chemical resource use, and this led to an increase in ecosystem functioning (measured as respiration rate). This was one of the first experimental evolution studies of multiple bacterial species cultured together and provides initial predictions for how bacteria are expected to evolve in diverse communities. Published in PLoS Biology 2012.

4) Further experiments looked at the possibility for genetic interactions among co-occurring bacterial strains. Specifically, we demonstrated that standing diversity of bacteria resistant to alternative antibiotics constrains the evolution of multi-drug resistance, unless they are able to exchange DNA. These results are among relatively few considering the effects of gene exchange on bacterial evolution in whole populations evolving to a changing environment experimentally. Published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2012.

5) We took these approaches into a field microcosm experiment, tracking the responses of natural bacterial communities (seeded into glass vessels) to warming against a background of natural fluctuations in temperature. We also manipulated the presence or absence of immigration from a local source pool. The results again were consistent with changes in species interactions being the main effect leading to changes in overall growth of communities. Immigration had differing effects depending on whether communities were in ambient or warmed conditions. These experiments - while conducted on bacteria over a few months - show some of the ways that communities are expected to respond to changing environments, which could apply to plant and animal communities over longer timescales faced with climate change. Published in American Naturalist 2015.
