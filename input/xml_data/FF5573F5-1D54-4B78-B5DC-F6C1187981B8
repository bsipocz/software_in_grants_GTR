We will create an online teaching resource called Dynamic Dialects that will provide easy access to multimedia material (videos and audio) showing how the vocal organs move during real speech. The website will be designed to aid phonetic training, language teaching and learning and speech therapy and will improve people's understanding of how speech sounds are produced. 

Knowing how to make a sound with your tongue and other vocal organs is important when you are learning a foreign language with unfamiliar sounds, learning how to produce a sound in your own language that you have difficulty with, or if you need to teach other people how to make speech sounds, e.g. as a phonetician, language teacher or speech therapist, and also if you want to carry out research into how speech sounds change over time. Without being able to see what is going on in the vocal tract, it can be a struggle to understand what to do to achieve the correct sound quality.

Traditional phonetics teaching relies on visual cues, such as lip and jaw movement; diagrams of the vocal tract; focussing on and trying to interpret the movements of your own vocal organs during speech and, of course, listening to and trying to interpret the acoustic signal produced during speech. Analysis of speech that is based mainly on listening to other people's speech or feeling your own articulatory movement can lead to misunderstandings of how speech sounds are produced. Not everyone has the same strategy for producing sounds. We find, through articulatory-based research, that speakers often have very different strategies for producing a speech sound than what might be expected.

Ultrasound tongue imaging video, Magnetic Resonance Imaging video, lip movement video and animations (based on data gathered through all of these technologies) can offer a new insight into exactly how speech sounds are produced. Speech production can be taught with visual stimuli showing, or based on, real speech, to aid learning. Articulatory strategies can be copied and practised using a visual, as well as auditory, models. 

The Dynamic Dialects articulatory teaching resource will allow contain a collection of pronunciations of words from speakers of different varieties of English, which will be an invaluable resource for the study of linguistic change in the future, preserving not only how speech sounded, but how it was produced.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal beneficiaries of this resource will be a wide range of students an professionals with interests in Language study, for example students and teachers of phonetics; English as a Second Language (ESL) and English ad a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers; speech therapists; drama and voice coaches. This resource will provide these users with a range of modelled and natural speech and is the first resource of its kind. Users will be able to view the articulators in action, rather than relying on purely auditory stimuli, static diagrams or descriptions of speech. We expect this resource to have a significant impact on the accuracy of speech and language teaching as articulatory data can help overturn erroneous views of how speech is produced. The resource will be available freely online to users around the world.

The resource is also important in preserving a snapshot of language, from both an acoustic and articulatory perspective, as it is today. Future researchers will be able to use this resource to study sound change over time, by comparing how speech sounds were produced today with how they develop in the future, e.g. the study of consonantal vocalisation where consonants change into vowels over time.

The raw data in this resource will be preserved for student and postgraduate research projects into language articulation and will be made available to users at other research institutes with the appropriate permissions and ethical approval.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>185905</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>interview for BBC World Service: Crowd Science</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D54C17DC-DFE5-40CB-AA1A-B1A4B2CC381F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BBC World Service Crowd Science creates documentaries in response to listeners' questions.

It is difficult to quantify the impact of this event; however, some children were very interested in the ultrasound machine and returned again and again to look at their tongue moving, experimenting with producing different speech sounds. At one venue, a young boy took over the demonstration and began showing people how to apply gel to the probe, where to place it under their chin and described their speech movements to them. I believe that the demonstration stimulated an interest in speech articulation for the children who returned again and again to the demo. As I said, it is very difficult to quantify what the long-term impact of this interest will be.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a4e5be9a755.95547486</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UTI researcher training (06/14)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5221ECD4-6C18-45B1-8BE9-CBF9B9383DB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Advanced and Intermediate Training in UTI data analysis for post-doc, PhD and active researchers from around the UK, June 2014.

We had a range of participants, from families with young children to early teenaged schoolboys (who loved the ultrasound headset) to university students and couples interested in science. The evaluation sheets rated the workshops as 'excellent' or 'very good', saying that they were 'very interesting'. Two afterschool teachers had brought the group of teenage boys to the university, and were very enthusiastic about the impact of being in a phonetics lab and taking part in 'real' research.

We have also conducted several public engagement activities (Meet the Expert, Glasgow Science Centre; Seeing Speech, Glasgow Science Festival), as well as specific workshops for speech and language therapists.

Our resources are used to teach and learn about speech articulation (i.e. how speech is produced by the moving vocal organs). The movements of many of the vocal organs are hidden within the head and throat, but the medical imaging techniques that we used reveals this hidden movement.

Our resource allows the easy comparison of accents of English across the World, either through an interactive map or through a chart. Accent coaches can select a particular word and compare its pronunciation across accents, hearing not only how it sounds, but seeing also the movement of the tongue and the speaker's lips.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3FD8F695-98A0-4CF9-BC3C-940D77240D00</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>558ac5898f8965.59468149</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project developed two new freely-available online resources for the study of the movements of the vocal organs during speech.

Accurate 2-D animations of the human vocal tract, based on MRI recordings of real speech, were created and made available to users of our online resource. 
During the project we developed:
(1) an MRI recording protocol with an improved frame rate.
(2) a set of 100 MRI videos of the moving vocal tract during speech.
(3) a method of integrating ultrasound tongue imaging video with lip-movement video.
(4) a set of 1,500 integrated videos of tongue and lip movement from 53 native speakers of English from 48 different localities in 16 different countries around the world
(5) a method for turning MRI video recordings into 2-D animation, improving on the deficiencies of the MRI recordings: low frame rate, blurring of articulatory surfaces, missing passive articulators.
(6) a set of empirically-based articulatory 2-D animations of speech sounds.
(7) methods and protocols to process large numbers of short videos (around 7,000) in order to make them optimally accessible to an online audience. 
(8) a set of written materials that introduce users to vocal tract imaging techniques such as UTI and MRI and describe the recording processes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our online resources have received interest from the following users: phonetics teachers and students; speech and language therapists; accent coaches; English Language learners.
