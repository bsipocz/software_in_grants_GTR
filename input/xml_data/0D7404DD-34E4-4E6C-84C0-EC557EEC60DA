Subsequently the same factors allowed development of techniques for the assay and propagation of viruses in the laboratory, using eggs then tissue culture. These same techniques then played important roles in mammalian virology. Nowadays poultry virology helps protect us from emerging zoonotic viruses such as H5N1 and West Nile virus. It also helps protect the supply of the most important and universally acceptable sources of animal protein to feed a growing world population. That supply has to be protected throughout the sophisticated modern industry, from elite founder stocks in worldwide (including UK and European) breeder companies right down to the massive, obvious level of broiler and egg production. Infectious threats arise regularly, sometimes from previously unknown viruses.
Less obviously, poultry virology plays major roles in human health and in the Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical industries. Isolation and diagnosis of viruses is often conducted in eggs or avian cells, and some important vaccines (notably seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines) are produced in them. Diagnosis and isolation of viruses that remain unknown, and their production to make new vaccines, will probably require the development of genetically modified eggs and chicken cells.
The UK has traditionally been strong in poultry virus research, arguably leading to the development of the influenza vaccine and to the discovery of antiviral interferon. It has also contributed extensively to work on emerging viruses. BBSRC plans increased effort in poultry virology in the new National Centre for Livestock Virology at IAH Pirbright, working alongside a new National Avian Research Facility at Roslin, Edinburgh. However, until those facilities are completed, the field faces difficulties in recruitment, retention, succession and critical mass.
This proposal addresses important scientific challenges in the design and development of modified cells to allow better isolation and diagnosis of emerging viruses as well as faster and better production of vaccines against them (to protect global food supply but also to benefit the Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical industries). It will cover endemic and exotic viruses as, in the poultry sector, new viruses rapidly cross national and continental boundaries to become global problems. 
More importantly, it will help secure effective capacity in UK poultry virus research in advance of the new facilities. It establishes a small, focussed and focal network of university teams, with considerable experience of poultry virology, to recruit young post-doctoral scientists. It will be supported by a leading, representative researcher each from Roslin and IAH, offering network access to those facilities and assisting in managing the programme. Recruits will be trained in the demands of the academic sector, alongside and in collaboration with biomedical scientists, to publish in high impact journals and regularly aim for academic fellowships, yet they will receive strong guidance in poultry virology (and related disciplines) from their teams and the network, with strong support from the IAH and Roslin. The programme cannot cover all aspects of poultry virology and related disciplines but it is hoped that other centres of excellence with interests in poultry virology (e.g. Edinburgh, Belfast, Liverpool, Warwick, DEFRA's AHVLA) will participate in training and collaborating with those who will form the core of the next generation of UK poultry virologists. At the end, some recruits are expected to join the national poultry research facilities while others will remain in universities, but in strong positions to collaborate with those in the facilities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Whether emerging viruses present as clinical or sub-clinical, acute or persistent, affects how far they might spread before they are recognised. In either situation, interactions between the virus and cell will be crucial, as they will dictate whether or not the virus will be able to replicate and whether or not it induces the expression of host responses that might be used as key signals of otherwise inapparent infection. 

These interactions will be affected by host genetic factors that influence innate antiviral responses, particularly the &amp;quot;cell-autonomous&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;intrinsic&amp;quot; responses, and by virus countermeasures. Consequently, this programme focuses on: 

(i) characterizing innate and intrinsic responses, and the influence of different host genetic backgrounds; 
(ii) isolating new substrates for virus diagnosis, analysis and propagation (by modifying cells and by producing transgenic chickens); 
(iii) studying interactions between known viruses and the innate/intrinsic responses. MDV, ALV-J, IBDV and CAV are good examples of viruses causing sub-clinical and persistent infections. AIV and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) will also be studied because they have well recognised modulators of the mammalian innate/intrinsic responses that are likely to target the chicken (and other avian) responses in broad, but distinct, ways. If AIV were to return to poultry from mammalian reservoirs to which it has become adapted (rather than from ducks, as is usual) it might also be limited by its altered receptor tropism; and
(iv) streamlining recombinant vaccine development by quickly identifying appropriate epitopes and antigens to incorporate into the vaccine (particularly for pathogens with large genomes) that induce suitable responses across different chicken breeds. 

In doing so, the programme will create also a cadre of new generation poultry virologists well trained and equipped to tackle the threat posed to global food security by emerging viruses of poultry.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries of this research would be:

Commercial vaccine producers.
The work, though directly relevant to producers of poultry vaccines will have ramifications for the vaccine industry in the human sector. Benefits of the work, if it leads (directly or indirectly) to improved conventional live, killed, recombinant or subunit vaccines will be across the board: increased food security, wealth creation (vaccine producers, poultry producers), quality-of-life (reducing risk of pandemic flu, protecting supply of poultry meat and eggs - a key source of nutrition worldwide, protecting from infection).

Poultry Breeders. 
Breeders will have new approaches and materials for diagnostic of incipient latent infections that might threaten their flocks.

Poultry Farmers. 
Farmers will benefit from access to improved recombinant vaccines. Initially this will be via relatively high technology commercial producers. However, improvements in yield could reduce vaccine costs making them more accessible in developing countries and smaller-scale operations.

Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (3Rs). 
Most of the programme aims to improve and develop cell lines to allow more work with viruses and vaccines in vitro. In particular the technology to be developed in Goal 5 should to reduce animal usage and severity of procedures by early elimination of some vaccine candidates using just a few animals without the need for challenge experiments, leaving only the best vaccine candidates to receive the full and careful analysis using challenge experiments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5069405</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview for the  magazine Science &amp; Vie (Science &amp; Life, the n?1 science magazine in France)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4078A95-3D6A-4342-B9BA-AF08668D518F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview for an article on genetically modified farm animals resistant to infectious diseases.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c13f603bde19.82324117</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NERC Public Engagement Strategy information event &quot;Public engagement: discussing GM animals&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76DF9C3F-76EE-4704-B7A6-50D4779ADD23</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented on &amp;quot;Public engagement: discussing GM animals&amp;quot; to illustrate the benefits, interest and challenges of public engagement on a potentailly controversial topic</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b40578f03c23.02645984</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Come Dine With The Future</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92976625-01B9-463A-A6E9-D84825A670CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>What will we be eating in 50 years time?

A key finding last year was the ground-breaking demonstration, reported by Long et al in Nature (Species difference in ANP32A underlies influenza A virus polymerase host restriction. Long, J. et al. Nature, 2016; 529 (7584): 101 DOI: 10.1038/nature16474) of the identity of the gene that limits avian influenza virus replication to avian cells, unless they acquire specific mutations to allow them to replicate in mammalian cells, including human. Humans have the same gene but it is longer in all birds except ratites like the ostrich. Consistent with this discovery is the observation by others that avian influenza H5N1 isolated from ostriches looks just like a virus isolated from humans rather than one from chickens. 
Last year we also published a manuscript that constitutes a key resource for the relevant community, describing the chicken interferome (Giotis, ES et al. Chicken
interferome: avian interferon-stimulated genes identified by microarray and RNA-seq of primary chick embryo fibroblasts treated with a chicken type I interferon (IFN-alpha). Vet Res. 2016 Aug 5;47(1):75. doi: 10.1186/s13567-016-0363-8).

Extend and develop the scientific base in poultry virus research to maintain capacity pending commissioning of new national facilities. Aims: (1) address recognition of emerging viruses before wide dissemination of inapparent infections; (2) address need to prepare for emergence of new subtypes of avian influenza. Better substrates for production of vaccine viruses from (3) transgenic chickens or (4) designer cell lines; (5) faster identification of antigenic epitopes for recombinant vaccines. GOAL A: To create a cadre of new researchers who will form the core of the next generation of UK poultry virologists. GOAL 1 is the development of systems to recognize the pre-symptomatic presence of novel pathogens. Firstly spontaneously or artificially immortalized cell lines will be isolated from CEFs produced from chickens that differ in their genetic susceptibility to viral pathogens. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis will be conducted on control and induced, or infected CEFs or cell lines, probing for signatures of altered cellular expression and metabolism, for which rapid assays will be developed to detect 'signatures' in culture or in infected embryonated eggs. These same 'omic approaches will also be applied elsewhere to support the other goals. 1.1 Development of spontaneously or artificially immortalized cell lines for the propagation of chicken pathogens 1.2 Identifying innate immune responses to persistent viruses using transcriptomics and proteomics of infected CEFs and cell lines. 1.3 Identifying innate immunity genes activated by virus infection of eggs 1.4 Development of qPCR macro-array for the detection of infection signatures 1.5 Development of indicator cell lines for the detection of chicken pathogens GOAL 2 (overlapping with generation of cell lines in Goal 1) will be the direct generation of cell lines more permissive to vaccine virus propagation, by expression of viral modulators or cellular regulators of the innate responses. 2.1 Modification of immortalised chicken cell lines to express putative virus and host-encoded antagonists of innate immunity 2.2 Modification of immortalised chicken cell lines with altered expression of cellular innate response genes 2.2(i) Development of a chicken-specific RNAi screening pipeline. 2.2(iii) Derivation of chicken cell lines more permissive to avian viruses. 2.2(iv) Identification of chicken host factors that enhance antiviral responses. GOAL 3 is the identification of viral and host determinants affecting the outcome of infection with AIV, including HPAI subtypes H5 and H7, to assist in evaluation of whether we need prepare for emergence of novel subtypes into poultry. 3.1 Construction of cell lines to investigate host-range factors for influenza virus 3.2 Generation of rg AIV to study the role of NS1. 3.3 Generation of rgAIV encoding GFP to study in vivo tropism in chickens. 3.4 Generation of rg reassortants of pH1N1 and AIV to test chicken infectivity. GOAL 4 will be the production of trangenic chicken lines in which innate immune suppressor genes are induciblyexpressed, to significantly increase the yield of vaccine viruses produced in embryonated eggs, and in CEFs derived from them. 4.1 Virus in vivo dynamics studies. 4.2 &amp;quot;Super-eggs&amp;quot; enhanced vaccine production vehicles. 4.2.1 Construction of inducible expression plasmids for combinations of IIS genes and chicken ST6GAL1. 4.2.2 Construction of transgenic chickens. 4.3 Comparison of yields and isolation efficiency in transgenic eggs. GOAL 5 is the development and evaluation of a new high-throughput method of determining in vivo T cell responses, to assist recombinant vaccine production, starting with IBDV as a model before tackling the large genome of MDV. 5.1 Developing class I and class II pipelines using selected peptides from IBDV 5.2 Validating both peptide pipelines using the genome of IBDV 5.3.
