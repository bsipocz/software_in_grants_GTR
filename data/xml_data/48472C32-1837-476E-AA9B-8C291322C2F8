In 1953 over 300 people died on the East Coast of England when one such storm surge caused severe flooding. Dr Anna Carlsson-Hyslop has investigated how a group of scientists in Liverpool tried to predict such events between 1919 and 1959 using statistics. The aims of the scientists? work, how it was carried out and how it was funded was at times closely connected. For example, during the Second World War a naval request for a storm surge forecasting formula prompted TI's researchers to focus on statistics as a fast way of meeting the request.&lt;br />&lt;br />How can historical research such as this have impact in today's society? During this award&amp;nbsp; Dr Carlsson-Hyslop aims to answer this question collaboratively developing methods of communicating this research to specific groups, including contemporary scientists, Liverpool residents and visitors to the city, and policy makers. The aim of the activities are not only to put her existing work across to new audiences, but also to prepare Dr. Carlsson-Hyslop for an academic career combining high quality, theoretically aware historical work with attention to contemporary concerns.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62281</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>60th anniversary of 1953 East Coast Flood - press release</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8070053A-8224-4B44-8935-29D270F4068A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>For the 60th anniversary of the 1953 East Coast Flood, which I had studied as part of my PhD, I prepared a press release in collaboration with Lancaster University Press Office.

I spent time considering these issues, undertaking training and doing reading, and also undertook a range of public engagement activities to communicate my findings and have impact. 
The fellowship had 'impact' on my ability to communicate these issues, enabling me to quickly respond to a media inquiry in February 2014 resulting in an article in the BBC News Magazine which received three quarters of a million unique hits. While many of my activities have remained stakeholder engagement the fellowship has prepared me to have greater direct impact in later posts.

During the fellowship I wrote a press release and took part in radio interviews. I also gave a presentation to the Environment Agency and another to present-day scientists. Since it I was interviewed for a BBC News magazine article by Jon Kelly (mentioned above) and I have written a blog for Policy@Manchester. In 2016 I gave a presentation to DEFRA as part of a History and Policy event. 

Less directly, I now work as a social researcher in the Civil Service. This uses skills I developed as an academic to have impact on policy. For example, I use knowledge about the history of energy in domestic dwellings in my work on the English Housing Survey - knowing about historic buildings and communication skills developed as a historian of science/technology enables me to understand both the policy issue and technical aspects of e.g. insulation, helping me have impact on BEIS policy through the English Housing Survey and to shape the survey to better meet policy needs.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C127DE08-2883-4A91-9064-8BB6F74EE31A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54634151871376.95436433</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The fellowship gave me time to develop my academic work in many ways and also my career. It allowed me to develop my PhD research, taking the ideas in it further for two journal articles. One of these pushes the links between practice and patronage, summarising the whole thesis. Another analyses the links between First World War anti-aircraft ballistics and tidal calculations, again linking practices of mathematics to patronage in a more temporally limited fashion. A third developed my postdoctoral work, on the promotion of electric heating in postwar Britain. This work in energy history allowed me to begin develop ideas for research projects in that area and to successfully apply for my current post. These ideas were also presented at academic conferences in different formats.

A key planned scientific impact for this kind of fellowship was the development of my own research skills and capacity. This was successful, culminating in me gaining another post and hopefully in a future academic career - I am currently applying for lectureships and developing a research proposal. The fellowship forms an important part of my CV for future job applications. I also took the chance of gaining teaching experience and a teaching qualification, which again will be important in future job applications. In addition I developed my public engagement skills.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It could inform thinking about the funding of flood science by providing examples of past policy and its impact. In my public engagement work I emphasise the social aspects of flooding and flood science, such as the political nature of funding of both flood science and flood defence. Policy makers and scientists at the Environment Agency and the National Oceanography Centre have been very interested in this aspect of the work. I have also aimed to provide a sense of the historical development of government flood policy, as well as the many similarities in responses to flooding (such as recurrent debates about dredging and drainage, or frequent 'blame games' about responsibility). In other words, I argue that historical work can show both what has changed and what has remained the same in relation to events such as flooding. This may increase understanding about the events as well as about what can be done about flooding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4B3DAA4F-F769-4D38-B9C9-472BDCD3CEA7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54633fb25101a2.80767081</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ABE12906-E66A-485D-99C8-7A204ED112E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Human Computing Practices and Patronage: Antiaircraft Ballistics and Tidal Calculations in First World War Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2b0c52c29b33e6c794dac9360e4a6090"><gtr:id>2b0c52c29b33e6c794dac9360e4a6090</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carlsson-Hyslop A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546321178f3434.93208769</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>329FC83B-F815-4C07-B691-0181B5867A32</gtr:id><gtr:title>Patronage and Practice in British Oceanography</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2b0c52c29b33e6c794dac9360e4a6090"><gtr:id>2b0c52c29b33e6c794dac9360e4a6090</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carlsson-Hyslop A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d63bfc73ab0.09266811</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A61A003D-3243-48F4-9B4D-B69C7DE73D6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Past Management of Energy Demand: Promotion and Adoption of Electric Heating in Britain 1945-1964</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment and History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2b0c52c29b33e6c794dac9360e4a6090"><gtr:id>2b0c52c29b33e6c794dac9360e4a6090</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carlsson-Hyslop A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dafa7f0910e0.56461924</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J002801/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3FB490ED-1150-4B72-BB38-E3A211952C34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
