We will focus on the privacy concerns of individuals in the context of their use of pervasive technologies, such as Smartphones and personal sensors which share data in the Cloud.

We aim to contribute to research in three areas: 

(1) software engineering of adaptive systems that guide their users to manage their privacy; 

(2) development of machine learning techniques to alleviate the cognitive and physical load of eliciting and personalising users' privacy requirements; and 

(3) empirical investigation of the privacy behaviour of, and in, groups, in the context of both collaboration and conflict.

The ability to control and maintain privacy is central to the preservation of identity. In recent years, social psychologists have made a core distinction between personal identity (which refers to what makes us unique, as individuals, compared to other individuals) and social identity (which refers to our sense of ourselves as members of a social group and the meaning that group has for us). In the latter case, our sense of who we are can be derived from our membership of social groups. Identity is not fixed, but is rather the outcome of a dynamic process. We can move from a personal to a social identity (and back again) depending on the context. We can move between different social identities (for example, as a male, a father, a worker, a football fan, English, British, etc). Identity matters because it provides a prism through which we perceive the world, experience events, decide how to act, and understand our relationships to other people. It tells who is and who is not of us, who is for us and who is against us. Understanding the identity process is therefore key to assessing the impact that privacy and security policies have on people's behaviours. This is essential in order to be able to deliver systems that can express and analyse users' privacy requirements and, at runtime, self-adapt and guide users as they move from context to context.

Broadly speaking, our proposed project asks the following two questions and attempts to answer them from both a social psychology and a computing perspective:

Can privacy be a distributed quality (across 'the group')?
If so, under what conditions might this be the case?

Can the group protect the privacy of the individual?
If so, how does the group manage the privacy-related behaviour of its members?

The research challenges for the project are to devise non-intrusive yet rigorous ways in which to study privacy, both using pervasive technologies (such as life-logging cameras and biometric sensors) and in order to deliver more effective privacy management. At the heart of the project is a hypothesis that individuals are able to better manage their privacy by adopting or learning from the 'wisdom of groups' - we use this term as an acknowledgement of the crowd sourcing movement, also adapted by others in the catchphrase 'wisdom of friends'. Our novelty is in extending this idea to exploit the wisdom of particular subsets of people - groups whose positions and knowledge are more nuanced than a crowd. Our technical challenge is to investigate what we call the privacy dynamics of individuals as they relate to their membership of social, professional or other groups, to develop computational (machine learning) techniques that support such dynamics, and then to deliver privacy management capabilities interactively, autonomously, and adaptively as individuals' contexts change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>322519</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:description>Memorandum of understanding with NII</gtr:description><gtr:id>00B8C56A-19EA-4C4D-886F-E6AD25A48A6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two papers:

A first major contribution is the development of new learning algorithms that are able to extract declarative knowledge from observations about human behaviours. the algorithms have increased expressivity than state-of-the-art systems and they are now de fact systems for learning declarative ASP programs. We have applied these systems to the context of privacy dynamics and have been able to show that it is indeed possible to learn privacy policies and privacy conflicts related to social identity conflicts. These results are currently been explored in the real setting of Facebook and other social networks. The second outcomes is the development of a probabilities learning approach as initially proposed. We are currently using this system for predicting level of sensitivity of pieces of information and use this in a framework for on-line learning of social benefits and privacy risk. These results also find immediate application in the context of social networks. A third contribution has been on the application of more conventional ML solutions to the classification of user behaviour on mobile phone with respect to their privacy awareness behaviour.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The learning systems developed in this project are general purpose systems. They can be applied to a large variety of problems and they are not specific to the task of learning privacy behaviours. This is one of the advantage of knowledge-driven machine learning versus our conventional machine learning. We envisage that these systems will be used to tackle a variety of learning tasks where the objective is to extract knowledge that can be expressed in English from observations. Current planned pathway to impact is the integration of these algorithms into the IBM Watson cognitive system in order to augment its cognitive capability. Other related and promising area of impacts are in healthcare where learning of hypothesis (diagnosis) is a key task of doctors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>78E4D4EA-1AC3-4315-908A-7AE9BE5BDEE8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df754bb31183.85356875</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Healthcare,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www9.open.ac.uk/PrivacyDynamics/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>State of the art ILASP system has been development during the life of this project and the executable is publicly available on https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ml1909/ILASP/.</gtr:description><gtr:id>48EE4B66-5985-4589-9109-54A369C92B25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Currently under discussion the possibility of an agreement with IBM for using this learning approach to develop cognitive system in health care.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5a587ac8be3.81838839</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Learning system</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>534EAE2D-DDDD-4291-A2E1-A47E05CDD1FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Logic-based Learning in Software Engineering</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bec165fae093ef4efb083d89ae58e14a"><gtr:id>bec165fae093ef4efb083d89ae58e14a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alrajeh, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e0020bea9595.48878789</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0705E63F-BFEB-4A02-83D8-AAD34D6B52E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning weak constraints in answer set programming</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dd8ba032e6295f50663b1be9c7c81d47"><gtr:id>dd8ba032e6295f50663b1be9c7c81d47</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LAW M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dffa75112518.54222510</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>959AC057-9146-400B-9C13-EA1EEEAB93FD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Risk-Driven Revision of Requirements Models in Software Engineering</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bec165fae093ef4efb083d89ae58e14a"><gtr:id>bec165fae093ef4efb083d89ae58e14a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alrajeh, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e00453c1bfc2.24500672</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BB3F8073-51EC-4336-9E2F-EAD3537029E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Probabilistic abductive logic programming using Dirichlet priors</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Approximate Reasoning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb8aa932bc5f4ae1de066bf248c50869"><gtr:id>cb8aa932bc5f4ae1de066bf248c50869</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Turliuc C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d67fcc52179.92960481</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3FDD8975-7653-4616-BF78-E8744042ED34</gtr:id><gtr:title>Automated support for diagnosis and repair</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communications of the ACM</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6ca2a456d03bf798164950b5741ee061"><gtr:id>6ca2a456d03bf798164950b5741ee061</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alrajeh D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dff9ce61e0c9.34332788</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D1F603C5-626E-45B4-AD6E-010C84E89B6D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Iterative Learning of Answer Set Programs from Context Dependent Examples</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dd8ba032e6295f50663b1be9c7c81d47"><gtr:id>dd8ba032e6295f50663b1be9c7c81d47</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LAW M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d692c28b7f7.60663884</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K033425/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
