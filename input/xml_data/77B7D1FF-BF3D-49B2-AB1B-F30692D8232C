Software for making published phyloinformatic data discoverable, open, and reusable</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/K015702/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Phylogenetic data, and the trees inferred from them, represent a hugely valuable resource for evolutionary biological research. The data are often expensive and time-consuming to acquire, and the results from analyses of these data - typically trees - represent a vast investment of effort and expertise across the global community of bioinformaticians and systematists. Trees, and their underlying character data, are often repurposed in other areas of biology; notably in evolutionary studies that seek to test patterns of genomic evolution or macroevolutionary trends. Despite their enormous value, recent research by the PDRA estimates that less than 4% of the phylogenetic trees published in 2010 are available in machine-readable form.

Our proposal stands at the leading edge of content mining technology. We will create Open Source 'data liberation' software tools that will allow us to unlock the greater proportion of phyloinformatic data from where they are currently buried in the literature. These will include phylogenetic trees, branch lengths and support values (extracted from the SVG content of PDF files), analytical methods and indices of data quality (from figure legends and the main body of the text) and the underlying molecular and morphological character data. We will also derive full bibliographic and geographical data for each source paper. We will test, refine and perfect these tools by applying them to PLoS, BMC, Elsevier, Wiley and Springer online content from the 21st Century. Once the data are extracted, we will ensure that their immense interdisciplinary (evolutionary biology, ecology, ethology, palaeobiology and conservation) and legacy potential is realised by making them available online in an explicitly open manner. We will also use the data ourselves in order to address several related questions concerning research effort, phyloinfomatic data quality and the progress of systematic research.

While there is renewed interest and emphasis on curating underlying research data and results (exemplified by projects such as TreeBASE, Dryad, BMC's partnership with LabArchives, and FigShare) these ventures rely upon author submission, which is rarely mandated by journals. Uptake has been slow and coverage is woeful. The data archiving success of NCBI/GenBank for nucleotide sequences (N.B., not alignments, trees or other results, and certainly not morphology) is the exception rather than the rule in the Biological Sciences. For the foreseeable future, therefore, there is a pressing need to retrospectively gather data from the published literature.

This project is extremely novel in its scale and ambition. If successful in re-extracting the majority of phylogenetic data from the last decade, the software will easily be adapted and modified by others to suit the data re-extraction needs of other areas of science. This will better harness the billions of pounds of research money hitherto invested into obtaining and analyzing data, only for it to have been locked down and subsequently obfuscated in PDF publications when projects are completed. 

The project is also widely trans-disciplinary, bringing together a macroevolutionary phylogeneticist (Wills), a chemoinformaticist (Murray-Rust), and a young, up-coming Researcher (Mounce). The potential wider benefits of this project are vast and diverse; content mining techniques are estimated to be capable of generating up to &amp;pound;200 billion annually in added value for Europe alone. We cannot claim to generate those benefits directly, but we will create open tools and generate open data that will greatly facilitate other commercial, industrial and academic ventures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>While there are well-established and excellent repositories for molecular sequence data (NCBI), there are no comparable resources for alignments or morphological data (Dryad is the best), still less for trees or other meta-data (measures of tree support, indices of homoplasy, etc.). These data remain locked down into PDFs, and are currently not machine-readable. This is hugely detrimental to many biological disciplines.

We will develop and perfect tools (PLUTo) enabling researchers to unlock phyloinformatic data from published PDFs. These will generate Newick/NeXML tree files (with branch lengths and support metrics) by interpreting SVG and other graphics, and parsing the text/legends for other data.

We will use AMI2 extraction technology, based on PDFBox, JUMBO and AMI-code. This is presently in prototype. The full code system (PLUTo) will comprise AMI2 and SOLR. 

The beta will be presented to BMC, PLoS and EuPMC staff/boards. We will also contact selected TA publishers to seek CC0 extraction agreements. The corpus of data will then be checked and annotated in detail by a data clerk (Bath) and via PyBossa (an OKF crowdsourcing community platform). 

We will explore the possibility of EuPMC and publisher-adopted installation for sustainable CC0 tree extraction. We will develop annotation tools for testing and validating PLUTo on new content. We will set up a PLUTo server based on SOLR (OKF already has Pubcrawler with extracted bibliographic metadata for 25 million STM publications in CKAN). PLUTo content will be uploaded to the OKF CKAN/Datahub (following the model for data.gov.uk). 

We will use the corpus to address key questions in phyloinformatics and systematics. Which clades are the foci of phylogenetic research and what types of data are being used? Importantly, how does this research effort relate to the diversity of clades? Are some groups disproportionately under-sampled? Is the quality of phylogenetic data variable across higher taxa?</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic Impact

This project will have international academic impact in five areas.
1. Our results will be indispensable for any researcher conducting a systematic review of the phylogenetic literature. We will have identified where all papers containing phylogenetic trees have been published in the last decade, and be able to extract trees, their meta-data and underlying character data from many of these publications. These resources will be repurposed in many additional projects. 
2. Our resources will be invaluable for evolutionary biologists, ecologists, ethologists and palaeobiologists needing to test evolutionary hypotheses against a phylogeny. There is also vast potential for developing phylogenetically-informed indices of conservation priorities. 
3. The project will complement and enhance the published literature by providing discoverable, open, reusable data. Our resources will also complement projects elsewhere, especially the Assembling and Visualising the Tree of Life NSF projects. In particular, we will author tools that will enable much of the backlog of phyloinformatic data to be liberated from the literature. We are aware of no strategy to achieve this implemented elsewhere. 
4. All systematic researchers will benefit from the project, as it relieves them from the responsibility of submitting their trees and meta-data to a separate repository (e.g., TreeBASE). The woeful coverage of such repositories (&amp;lt;4%) speaks to the inefficiency with which self-archiving captures the overall research investment. Making the data within a paper available and re-usable also increases the probability that the paper will be cited. 
5. The new tools and data will revolutionise the process of supertree construction. It will integrate with other tools under development for this purpose; notably the Supertree Toolkit (STK). 

Economic and Societal Impact

A recent appraisal of the economic potential of content mining techniques as applied to the scientific literature estimated that the value to Europe's economy could be &amp;pound;200 billion annually. Our project will develop cutting-edge technologies; considerably more advanced than straightforward text-mining, because we are also extracting images and amalgamating both techniques. Our proposal will promote technological progress in this area by providing open source software tools that can be applied transferably to other problems. A recent JISC report found that data mining techniques can result in substantial cost savings, productivity gains and innovative service development . The same report also found considerable potential for societal benefit; most significantly the provision of better visualisation techniques for large volumes of data. These new tools with ultimately allow researchers &amp;quot;to better convey research findings and other complex ideas to general audiences&amp;quot;. 

New developments in content mining technology within academia also highlight the need for a fresh appraisal of UK Copyright law. Currently there are no exceptions allowed for research purposes. However, the independent Hargreaves Review of intellectual property and growth suggested that exceptions should be made; particularly and especially where there are clearly identified scientific benefits. Thus, our findings (and the benefits from them) will lend considerable weight to these Hargreaves recommendations. This has the potential to influence legislative change that will affect UK society as a whole.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118765</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visit - Sexey's School - April 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97D9BFC8-3E7F-40FC-8BA7-D7B06178ED98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion with pupils, parents and staff from Sexey's and other schools.

We quantify the levels of homoplasy in over 1,200 morphological character matrices
of animals using parsimony, and investigate its distribution across taxa and
throughout research time. No index of homoplasy is entirely satisfactory, and we explore
the empirical relationship between the ensemble consistency index (CI), the ensemble
retention index (strictly an index of retained synapomorphy), and the
homoplasy excess ratio (HER). We propose a refinement to the latter; specifically controlling
for the distribution of missing entries. We also investigate whether levels of homoplasy
predict levels of tree support; specifically mean non-parametric bootstrap
support, total support index (TSI) and proportional support index (PSI). Surprisingly, the
relationship is not especially strong. Lastly, we model the extent to which all homoplasy
and support indices are biased by data matrix dimensions, complementing the theoretical
work of Hoyal-Cuthill and colleagues. We find the expected inverse relationship
between the number of taxa and the CI, but also between the number of characters
and CI. The CI is therefore a poor measure of homoplasy between data sets. The RI
and modified HER are much less biased by dataset parameters, and yield similar results,
although we prefer the scaling of the latter. We demonstrate a significant decline
in the CI inferred for data sets over the last 30 years of research time, but this is
largely attributable to an increase in data set dimensions over the same period. Residual
CI and modified HER show no such trends. There are also significant differences
in homoplasy and branch support between higher taxa, which remain after modeling
out data set dimensions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d701d3f2cdb6.23296754</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.systass.org/biennial2015/SystematicsAssociationBiennialConferenceProgramme2015v2.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Evolution 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD0EC789-EA65-4413-9643-76B8E179400B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hill, J., Tovar, J., Davis, K.E., Wills, MA.

'Dinosaur' visit 24/11/15
The year 1 curriculum is all about classification. The teachers have chosen dinosaurs (identification and common names) to illustrate structure, diet and environment. The curriculum extends this to include the structure of common animals including the human body, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. 

The talk will include dinosaurs and some features which give clues to their structure and function (eye sockets &amp;amp; teeth?) The lab activities will give an opportunity to look closely at skulls (spot the difference - eye sockets and dentition); diet of herbivores, omnivores and carnivores; eggs from fish, snails, manduca moths, locusts, chickens, quails; spiral timeline - colouring activity; skeletons; classification of mammals, amphibians, birds etc. There will be a 5 minute 'ask the expert' session at the end of the session. The children will depart the lab at 11:45.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d49c0240b457.62688356</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What limits the morphological disparity of clades? - Talk at Systematics Association Biennial, Oxford, August 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC4EE2D2-0731-4F17-A8EA-F27C40851DA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>What limits the morphological disparity of clades?

Patterns of morphological and taxonomic diversity are often at odds. Specifically,
there is a tendency for groups to reach maximum levels of morphological disparity
relatively early in their evolutionary histories, even while species richness or
diversity is comparatively low. Early high disparity is evident not only in a diverse range
of animal clades but also major groups of vascular plants, suggesting it may represent
a universal evolutionary phenomenon. The shapes of disparity profiles through time
can be quantified in terms of their centre of gravity, with bottom heaviness (CG &amp;lt; 0.50)
being typical of extinct clades that do not terminate at a mass extinction. It is widely
supposed that increasing developmental constraints or ecological restrictions limit the
range of morphologies that can evolve within a clade; consistent with an observed
decrease in the rate of origination of novel bodyplans and higher taxa through time.
It has also been demonstrated that the rate of evolution of new character states decreases
through time, although the relationship between this 'character exhaustion'
and overall disparity has hitherto been untested. Here, we quantify the rate of character
exhaustion in 93 published phylogenies of extinct animal clades, and test for a
relationship with disparity profile centre of gravity. We find no significant correlation,
and conclude that patterns of early high disparity are not shaped by exhaustion of
the state space in any straightforward manner.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d70259d8e7d1.49120268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.systass.org/biennial2015/SystematicsAssociationBiennialConferenceProgramme2015v2.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to Malmesbury School - talk open to members of the public (1st July)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7A684BF-DB37-45D4-B3E0-7BEEEBEB523F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk to approximately 60 members of the public and a small number of pupils.

Tools and methods for constructing the Tree of Life
University of York, 19th and 20th December, 2016

Evolutionary history, or phylogeny, is the backbone of systematics and knowledge of phylogeny is essential in a variety of fields within evolutionary biology; such as macroevolution, palaeontology, evolutionary ecology, and conservation. Non-specialists are increasingly in need of large, inclusive phylogenies for which there are two main methods of construction: the supermatrix and the supertree. For both methods, the main issues are collecting, curating and processing the source data. The individual sources will have individual tips and character data that do not match other sources due to misspellings, synonyms, or use of higher-level taxa. How do you correct this for hundreds or thousands of data sources? How do you efficiently collate hundreds of data sources? Supertrees combine a number of these overlapping source trees (source data) to then create the &amp;quot;supertree&amp;quot;. In contrast supermatrices take primary information from characters (including genes or morphological characters) and combine them into a single, large matrix. Both methods can be cumbersome and time-consuming when creating large phylogenies. And, less obviously but no less vital, how do you even begin to visualise your output of 1000s tips in any meaningful way?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c86f3396a662.81917213</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://jonxhill.wordpress.com/2016/11/15/tools-and-methods-for-constructing-the-tree-of-life/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Content Mining: Talk at JISC DigiFest Birmingham, 2/3/2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E737D05-400A-4367-B035-9C0F5EDAA682</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Content Mining: Talk at JISC DigiFest Birmingham, 2/3/2016

Recent months have seen an explosion of public, media and academic interest in the idea, threat and reality of extinction. This acknowledgement has contributed to debates over climate change and other, related, ways that humanity has altered environments and ecosystems in this epoch we have begun to call the Anthropocene. This one-day conference asks what role can culture play in widening the understanding, representation and, indeed, remembrance of this unfolding and catastrophic species loss. With this in mind, the event aims to foster dialogue between academics, journalists, museum curators, charities, writers, environmental groups, and the media to explore how societies engage with the complexities of the processes of extinction and remember the extinct. More specifically, the event examines how increased dialogue between these communities and constituencies contributes to the public re-evaluation and remembrance of life on our planet.

This allowed researchers, to mine documents or non-commercial purposes-without the permission of the rights holder. Before Hargreaves, we would have had to write 5000 mails to authors requesting permission to mine the documents. From past experience (e.g. Dr Max Hauessler mining sequences) we would expect that roughly 1/3 would refuse, 1/3 would fail to reply and 1/3 would give permission (but often with restrictive conditions). This would have added many months to the research and drastically reduced the value.
The PLUTo work is seen as a pre-eminent example of the &amp;quot;The Right to Read is the Right to Mine&amp;quot;. In 2015 Europe, through the Parliament and also the Commission, has sought to emulate the UK legislation to reform copyright. PM-R has worked closely with the European lead, MEP Julia Reda and also given evidence at the Commission and presented the work to otehr interested NGOs (LIBER, LERU, RLUK) and H2020 projects (LEARN, OpenMinTed, FutreTDM). PLUTo is therefore one of the archetypal examples of the importance of legal and directive reform.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C30DAC08-561B-4127-8D2F-F7EC0239D228</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df68ef468d58.51480559</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There are huge numbers of phylogentic trees and associated data in the biological literature, but most of these data are locked into figures that are not easily machine-readable. Phylogenetic trees are research outputs that often represent the distillation of hundreds of hours of research and computer time, but their inaccessibility in electronic form means that their utility is severely limited. Unlike molecular sequence data - which is archived and curated systematically in central online repositories - the archiving of morphological data is in its infancy, and the deposition of trees within servers such as 'TreeBase' is piecemeal. In this project, we have explored ways to extract phylogentic trees from the literature. We have developed a variety of tools (PLUTo) within the ContentMine workflow that enable us to extract trees and metadata from pdf files and others that enable us to systematically scrape journal content from open journal repositories. We have used these tools and data for three scientific applications thus far. Firstly, we have produced a supertree of microorganisms from the trees contained within 4,300 papers from the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. Secondly, we have analysed 1,300 morphological data matrices extracted by our scripts (and derived from other repositories) to explore the distribution of homoplasy (phylogenetic noise) across major groups of animals. Some clades (e.g., arthropods) contain significantly more homoplasy than others (e.g., mammals). Thirdly, we have used a small subset of our data to explore the heterogeneity of phylogenetic signal across the cranial and postcranial skeletons of vertebrates, finding that there is often significant disagreement between the trees derived from the partitions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our software and tools require further development, but they have already allowed us to tackle analyses that would have hitherto been intractable. There is potential to develop the accuracy of our character recognition algorithms, and the efficiency with which we check taxonomic names. Many phylogenetic figures are complex, composite diagrams that are difficult to decompose into tree branching structure, support values and taxon names because of conflating annotation. We are beginning to get to grips with these, but further development of the algorithms would be desirable. More generally, there is a vast demand for tools that will enable phyloinformatic and other scientific facts (currently tied up in pdf and other file types) to be made discoverable, indexable and available for repurposing. Our open source PLUTo tools, as part of the ContentMine workflow, will continue to develop and contribute to this objective.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9350F632-1892-41A0-A97E-4C97BB17D074</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df6956b03239.99037353</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Mounce RCP, Sansom R, Wills MA (2016) Data from: Sampling diverse characters improves phylogenies: Craniodental and postcranial characters of vertebrates often imply different trees.
