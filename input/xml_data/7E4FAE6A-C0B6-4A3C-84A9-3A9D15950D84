We outline the background of our study and the theory and methods on which it is based. \n\nMuch has been made of the possibility that religion has important effects on the economy. Huntington claims that international relations and trade are characterised by a clash of cultures. Cultural and especially religious difference harms economic and political interactions between nations. Some studies have identified differences in economic performance between nations based on their religions. Protestant and Buddhist nations tend to fare relatively better than Catholic and Islamic ones. In addition, nations tend to trade more with other nations that are seen to be culturally similar. \n \nEconomists argue that aggregate, macroeconomic phenomena such as productivity and trade are based on how people interact at the individual level. If individuals trust each other and cooperate, the economic fortunes of society as a whole are enhanced. If religion impacts on economic matters, individual decisions and behaviour should depend on the religious values of individuals and their trading partners. Economists use laboratory experiments to study how individuals decide in practice when faced with alternative options with differing financial reward. Often, these experiments involve games with mutual economic gain from cooperating but short-term individual advantage from selfish behaviour. \n \nIndividual religious values have a number of aspects. The first is denomination, i.e. which religion an individual adheres to. Second, individual religiosity has four dimensions, how often religious acts are practiced, how religion impacts on everyday life and how deep religious knowledge as well as spiritual experiences are. Religious adherents also differ in terms of how fundamentalist their outlooks are. The psychology of religion has examined the effect of religion and religiosity on pro-social behaviour. Religion can harm cooperative behaviour when adherents trust others less to the extent that they belong to different faiths or are seen as having a sinful nature. Conversely, charitable religious doctrines can enhance sociality. These aspects of individual religion are related to an individual's personal characteristics such as age, gender, education and social class, as well as to a number of socio-economic values such as perception of the self, personal outlook, attitudes to others, to institutions and the environment.\n \nOur study combines methods of economics and psychology to assess whether religious denomination and values impact on economic interactions between individuals. We intend to recruit subjects from different religious backgrounds in locations with denominational diversity, such as Israel (Muslim and Jewish), Germany (Protestant and Catholic), Bangladesh (Hindu and Muslim) and Malaysia (Muslim and Buddhist). We will survey religious and socio-economic values before engaging subjects in games where both players' decisions determine financial reward. Subjects will be asked to play when nothing is known about the opponent to test the effect of religious and general values on pro-sociality with strangers. Next, subjects will be asked to interact with co-players that are identified by religious and/or ethnic background to assess the effect of difference or similarity on their interaction. The resulting data can reveal to what extent strategic decisions can be explained by religious denominations of players, their religiosity, fundamentalism as well as socio-economic values and demographics. The design will enable us to assess whether it is the religious or socio-economic factors and demographics that are responsible for any behavioural differences between subjects we may find. This will enable us to ascertain if the thesis of a clash of cultures is correct, and whether it is the religious aspect of culture that is responsible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47477</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F007779/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
