Renewable electricity is increasingly replacing fossil fuel power in our demanding energy network, now accounting for a quarter of our national electrical energy supply. However, a low cost means of storing that unpredictable energy supply to match demand has yet to be developed. 

Redox flow batteries are large scale rechargeable batteries particularly suited to grid scale storage. They are modular, flexible, inherently safe, and have lifetimes over 20 years. In particular, power and energy storage are independently scalable, unlike traditional batteries such as lithium ion. Megawatt-hour systems of aqueous batteries have been installed globally to support wind and solar farms, yet are expensive and unsustainable, typically costing triple the target value of feasible energy storage. 

To ensure a real reduction in the cost of flow battery energy storage, an overhaul of the intrinsic chemistry of the system is necessary. An approach is required where complexes are targeted in their design to deliver specific properties, and are comprised of sustainable, low cost materials. The objective of this research is to identify, synthesise and evaluate complexes that exploit the higher voltages and opportunity for rational design offered by using non-aqueous solvents. Furthermore, the programme offers the prospect of working with a network of academics and industry such that the strategic new chemistries and the flow cell engineering are developed simultaneously. 

Redox flow batteries are scalable technologies, therefore can range from single household systems (on the kilowatt-hour scale), to community and grid-scale networks. The ultimate objective of this work is to offer affordable, sustainable and long-lasting electrical energy storage, to make renewable electricity reliable and accessible to everyone.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The intermittent nature of renewable energy technologies, accounting for 25% of the UK electric power sector, the need for improved electrical grid reliability and its response to intermittency, are motivating the development of grid-scale energy storage technology. Energy storage is a rapidly emerging research sector internationally, with research councils and government initiatives exemplifying its national importance via initiatives such as the SUPERGEN Energy Storage Hub and Energy Catalyst programmes. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are an especially attractive technology for grid-scale storage due to flexible scalability, long lifetimes, and conceptually simple design. Since their commercial inception in 2001, aqueous RFBs have been at the forefront of system development, with the all-vanadium RFB the technological leader. They are currently too expensive for grid deployment, however, owing in part to the limitations of the aqueous chemistry and the vanadium raw material employed. Non-aqueous RFBs could offer several advantages over their aqueous counterparts, including higher voltages, higher energy density, and lower materials costs. As yet, they have not fulfilled this potential , as their stability and performance do not compete with the more mature aqueous systems. 

This programme outlines a strategy to synthesise stable, metal-organic complexes with rationally designed redox non-innocent ligands that will create batteries with large cell voltages and high concentrations. Such batteries would demonstrate high energy densities approaching those of lithium-ion batteries, whilst retaining the advantages of a decoupled power and energy storage system, ideal for grid-scale deployment. The target molecules will be synthesized from cheap and sustainable precursors, and entail simple synthetic procedures, with a view to producing lower cost energy storage systems than currently exist. Concurrently, the battery device architecture will be studied and engineered to best evaluate and use the new non-aqueous electrolytes. Simultaneous development of the new chemistries and the central electrochemical device will accelerate the impact of the systems by bringing them to a technology readiness level ripe for exploitation by industrial partners as a competitor to aqueous RFBs. 

Research into non-aqueous RFBs utilizing redox non-innocent ligands is a novel approach, and offers potential for high impact industrial advances in a nascent market. It is paramount to the success of a diverse energy storage movement within the UK that fundamental advancements in RFB technology be developed and key, emerging industries born. Potential users of the technology will be identified at strategic networking encounters, such as the UK RFB Network to be established by the PI in 2017, and the annual UK Energy Storage Conference. The objectives are to make RFB energy storage low cost and accessible, such that renewables can further penetrate the energy sector. This will offset national carbon contributions, and reduce fuel poverty by making renewable electricity reliable, secure, and affordable.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99670</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R000301/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>97AD4D1C-4499-4C7E-AF8A-FE9EFE56E306</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
