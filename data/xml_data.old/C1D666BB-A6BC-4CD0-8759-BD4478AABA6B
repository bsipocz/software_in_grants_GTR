NIAB has members associated with high affiliation of arable and horticultural growers. Alzeim has a well co-ordinated network of growers and farm specialists within Wales with whom the Consortium will place contracts and ensure a scientifically- led development of the crop. Grower guides and demonstrations plots will be made available via specialist meetings and workshops, such as Members Days at NIAB and choice of cultivars and production methods will be published as part of the NIAB publication set when the crop is at a suitable stage of development. Meetings and workshops will be held to demonstrate the potential of this crop to meet the requirements of farmers, processors and the food companies. These will include the NNFCC at York and other bodies. It is probable that upland growers will be the first to participate and benefit, but when the `Black Mountains Effect' is understood it is hoped that growing can be extended to other altitudes and areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>337844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Agricultural University (RAU)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Royal Agricultural University Cirencester</gtr:description><gtr:id>52318D5D-2E3B-4FB8-9A49-E40F7FFBF9FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Optimisation of extraction and analysis procedures

In particular; it aimed to quantify which environmental factors impact on the active ingredient and whether this knowledge could be used to improve predictable economically viable production of this vital pharmaceutical. 

The crop of interest is daffodil and the (active ingredient) AI is Galanthamine; used in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
The impact of this work is significant in that it has enabled the industry partners to inform and expand their commercial outputs. 
The lead partner of this project (Agroceutical) area an SME that was set up to consider precisely how the crop responds to climatic and other abiotic conditions alongside development of novel extraction methods; using both bulb and leaf material to supply pharmaceutical companies with pure extracts. 
The project has led to findings relating to the importance of geographical site, temperature, light quality (UV:IR) pH and weather patterns (especially wind) on the levels of galanthamine that can be extracted from tissues. 
The work at NIAB, which was completed at field scale, complimented the work at Bangor University, which was undertaken using hydroponics under very controlled conditions. 
NIAB and Agroceutical are now developing a 'Growers Manual' for precise delivery of improved cultivation practices with close participation of farmers. Furthermore additional work has been initiated in which Agroceutical are analysing both Galanthamine (and other pharmaceutical alkaloids) and soil physico-chemistry. This is being built into the data set including latitude, altitude, etc, 
This useful body of data is was necessary to both target commercial growing locations, and will also provide some very interesting information to supplement the LINK programme's analysis of agronomic factors. 
Additional selection work undertaken at NIAB in collaboration with second industry partner (New Generation Daffodils) has enabled us to identify improved germplasm and we anticipate that this will lead to sales into this niche market.
The results of this project have now been used to set up a new Galanthamine processing plant in south Wales by the Lead Partner. A small factory has been set up in the past six months in 2016- 2017 with pharmaceutical markets secured.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A3CCAB10-7D3F-4E6F-A953-4383EBEC6994</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460e4749fa767.94555811</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Small scale industrial production of purified Galanthamine has been completed by the lead industry partner and a contract for sales secured</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>BB/J003794/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>6F83C914-9996-47ED-9909-0FB6EA1B5CFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved UK source of vital pharmaceutical for future treatment of disease</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Commercial In Confidence</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>56e062d85698c5.64341942</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:protection>Protection not required</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Production of pharmaceutical grade Galanthamine</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2015</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We set up experiments to determine the most important environmental influences on the yield of Galanthamine.
Four field trials were established in 2011 in different locations around the UK. These enabled us to test the effects of soil type and altitude on yield. These experiments were repeated in years 2013 and 2014 to determine impact of weather in succeeding years; local weather stations were installed to ensure results were accurate to the locality. 

A further nine controlled pot experiments were established at NIAB, Cambridge in 2012 and continued until 2015 to evaluate other agronomic and input affects but under the same abiotic conditions for most factors. By isolating the individual environmental effects we aimed to determine which factors have the most influence on the yield expressed both as % fresh weight and total yield per bulb.


The initial harvest results from 2013 were surprising. The most significant impact on the yield (other than variety identity) has been the source of the bulbs (hence the previous year growing conditions). Those originally grown in Brecon (Wales) were smaller but more productive than those grown in Devon under more favourable conditions- in terms of nutrients and weather conditions.

We analysed the harvest from 2014 to determine how the growing conditions influenced AI productivity of these bulbs. 
In terms of altitude and temperature; results have indicated that these did not have a repeatable impact on galanthamine production; there were, however, differences. Reading across sites, it was found that wind intensity added to growing conditions were both significant factors in predictable production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).

Results from all sites and under all conditions show that the variety identity has a very significant impact on galanthamine production; by almost an order of magnitude from the worst to the best and that the most productive lines grown under the least productive conditions (with respect to galanthamine) were only significantly better in some years. It seems likely therefore that cultivation site remains important, but that variety development remains the most important factor that will further increase productivity in the future.

Recent work has shown that the plants are very unpalatable to farm livestock; the crop can therefore be cultivated within upland pastures without fear of poisoning stock, thus enabling duel cultivation methods, which are now being developed

A few results remain to be completed and a thorough elucidation of key factors will emerge once all results have been documented and evaluated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project is complete and we are now working with farmers and other specialist growers which have lead to a series of recommendations with respect to growing conditions and potential for further farmer- led improvements in galanthamine production in the UK. As indicated by previous work, there is data to show that the growing conditions during bulb production in the previous year has a significant impact on galanthamine content at harvest in the following year. 

This is enabling a better understanding of the environmental effects and will form the basis of clear messages and a draft 'Grower Manual' that will be prepared following discussions with farmers. 

This is a tried and tested method for practical communication of results to the growers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0DE48C3A-C7F7-4C02-B286-7CD89CDDF002</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461e659d681a3.32926233</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5721</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Talk and discussion with government funding organisations and independant charity funders</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>279A5E72-2651-4349-A6CD-E2799366AE62</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Change of acceptability of Galanthamine based pharmaceuticals for treamemnt of Alzheimer's disease in the National Health Service as determined by NICE</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb28cd10e48.34261719</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The product has been refined to the requirement of industry and a buyer has been found</gtr:description><gtr:id>3BF932F4-876E-4BB7-8F44-D2BB7C982F3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Further impacts will arise once harvesting and processing is further improved</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e063ee5a89c6.56032895</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Refined Galanthamine</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Drug</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2015</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Agroceutical</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>After a tough period when business angels pulled out Agroceutical was established using some of the materials from Alzeim Ltd.
