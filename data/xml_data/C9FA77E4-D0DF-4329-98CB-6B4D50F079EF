An important aspect of resource scarcity involves public goods. Lack of public goods, like health and education, can significantly reduce the welfare of individuals and households and often this affects the poorest the most. In India, these issues are amplified by the existence of a long-standing social structure based around caste and religion. Such social fragmentation can result in social exclusion and/or lower public good provision.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project investigates the behavioural foundations of inter-group discrimination on economic performance in rural West Bengal, India. It builds on existing household survey work on religious- and caste-based social exclusion in villages in West Bengal by conducting a series of field experiments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Field experiments study the decisions of agents who in their daily lives are affected by poverty, and help determine the extent to which their preferences regarding caste, ethnicity and religion determine their willingness to socially exclude others or themselves to be excluded.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project?s findings will help policy-makers to the extent that they facilitate the identification of the right policy response to social exclusion and lower economic performance, which in turn are key determinants of poverty.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research project will be academics, Indian, and international government agencies, NGOs as well as anyone in the wider civil society who is interested in issues of poverty, racial and/or religious discrimination. We will concentrate our attention in this section to non-academic beneficiaries.

In terms of policy users, we plan to produce a non-technical impact report, which will be generated at the end of the grant period. This report will contain not only a summary of the findings of the project, but also their policy implications to the West Bengal Government and India-based NGOs. We will organise a workshop in which we will present our findings to representatives from the local and state governments, NGOs and other parties such as USAID or the World Bank - the latter not only has an interest in issues related to caste-based discrimination, but has engaged in collaborative research with the CSSSC.

We envisage that our research will impact on poverty alleviation efforts and policy indirectly. It will do so by identifying the channels (in particular inter-group discrimination) through which social fragmentation along religious lines affects public good provision. Understanding why the presence of multiple social groups (typically ethnic and/or religious) in a given society leads to lower provision of public goods allows governments and NGOs to create the appropriate policy response and maximise the return to aid investment. 

A case in point is the provision of a local public good, such as education. Two social groups like Muslims and Hindus may prefer not to share a local school for two very different reasons. On the one hand, they may prefer two different types of public good: madrassas typically segregate students along gender lines, while state schools do not, which may be important to more orthodox Muslim families. On the other hand, members of one group may not want to share the public good with people of the other group. The optimal response is quite different depending on the cause. In the former case, subsidising madrassas is optimal, as it will lead to higher rates of school attendance by women from Muslim backgrounds. In the latter case, encouraging attendance into the state school system may be more beneficial in order to reduce prejudice across religious lines.

Finally, we hope to be able to introduce experimental economics as a valid new tool to policy makers. Policy designers increasingly resort to experimental methods to test the applicability of particular market mechanisms. Examples include the design of 3G bandwidth auctions in the UK in 2000 (Binmore and Klemperer, 2001) and the sale of CO2 emission permits in Australia (Cason et al, 2003). We hope to demonstrate that economics experiments can also be useful tools to uncover underlying behavioural mechanisms around which one can tailor policy.

The timescale for impact to be realised is likely to exceed the duration of the grant. The main means to achieve impact (the workshop and the report) will be realised at the end of the grant period. As such, we expect that impact of the research in terms of policy and wider community will be felt in the 2 years following the completion of the grant. We hope this will happen through the recognition of the effect of discrimination in the design of poverty alleviation policies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92731</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>HEC talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA4590D1-DB88-4EB5-95C3-419230DF08C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards.

The purposes of the workshop were: (i) to increase awareness of the potential experimental economics methodology has to help understand particular issues in development economics; (ii) to disseminate the findings of the relationship between cooperation and social fragmentation, particularly religious fragmentation. We invited a panel of discussants from the academic and policy world, including Prof. Rohini Somanathan, and Prof. Pushkar Maitra, who are leading experts in development economics in the Indian context; we also invited Prof. Abhirup Sarkar, who is chairman of the West Bengal Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (WBIDFC), vice chairman of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), a member of the State Planning Board of West Bengal and a member of the Expert Committee on Health in West Bengal.

We have no material evidence thus far of any policy document that explicitly builds on our findings. This is not entirely unexpected, as the work we conducted was primary social science research on cooperation. Therefore, its primary non-academic impact is the increased awareness by policy makers of the issues and, importantly, the evidence surrounding social fragmentation and religion, as well as the effectiveness of the research methodology in addressing these questions. We believe the workshop and the project were successful in that regard.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B0FA982E-4585-4305-93C3-B273C4615DEA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545c9ca45f9d59.81861423</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Economists have established over the last two decades a negative relationship between social fragmentation (typically defined as a function of the relative size of different social groups in the population) and economic performance, in particular public good provision. 

There are many possible reasons for this negative relationship: different social groups may prefer different types of public good; restricting economic transactions to within a group may also be useful as it reduces informational asymmetries, and increases the scope for the punishment of transgressors. Finally, individuals may prefer to share a public good with those of their own group and/or dislike sharing a public good with people from other social groups.

We study the effect of village-level religious fragmentation on intra- and inter-group cooperation. We are particularly interested in understanding the role religious identity plays in explaining behavior in our experiments. India is an ideal setting to study our research question, having a longstanding social structure characterized by fragmentation along religious lines, as well as a rigid caste system. Issues such as social exclusion and public good provision (or lack thereof) along religious lines are widely documented.

We build upon existing household survey work on religious-based social exclusion in villages in West Bengal, India, and we focus our attention to the problem of religious discrimination among Muslim and Hindu communities in West Bengal.

We study the effect of religious identity among Hindu and Muslim groups by having Muslim and Hindu participants play a series of economic games: the Prisoners' Dilemma, the Stag Hunt, which are games that measure the degree to which people are able to achieve cooperation; the Tullock Contest, which measures the degree to which people will compete for resources; and the Dictator Game, which measures other-regarding preferences. 

To study inter-group discrimination, we vary the way our subjects are matched with each other. We implement in-group/in-group treatments where Muslim subjects play with fellow Muslim subjects and Hindu subjects play with fellow Hindu subjects; we also implement in-group/out-group treatments where Hindu subjects play with Muslim subjects. Finally, we have a control treatment where the identity of a subject's match is uncertain. 

To study the effect of fragmentation, we resort to a quasi-experimental approach. We take religious composition of villages as fixed, based on the village-level survey on religious fragmentation by Das et al. (2011). We select villages in two districts in West Bengal which conform to one of three categories: Muslim-dominated, where over 90% of the population is Muslim; Hindu-dominated, where over 90% of the population is Hindu; and fragmented, where the Muslim and Hindu communities are roughly equal.

We find evidence that both Hindu and Muslim participants exhibit in-group biases. That is, in villages where both religions are present, participants are more likely to cooperate with people who profess their religion than with those who do not. However, this does not mean that religious homogeneity is optimal: cooperation rates in religiously-homogeneous villages are lower than in religiously-heterogeneous villages. Diversity spurs a sense of religious identity that triggers a higher willingness to cooperate with fellow in-group members; but not a lower willingness to cooperate with out-group members.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are finalising the write-up of our findings. Our research project deals with understanding individual preferences through observing choices; we are particularly interested in how these preferences are shaped by membership of religious groups. As such, while there is no direct policy application of our findings, we hope that they can be used as a primary research source for policy-makers dealing with diversity issues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>099A0E83-D673-4B02-8D85-E8A7DC8C5D33</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545c9e3689eb52.46189035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2383A371-ECD0-466F-AD02-BD99603CDCDE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religious fragmentation, social identity and rent-seeking: Evidence from an artefactual field experiment in India</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b7314403a3c9f54acb4aad832f7c9c95"><gtr:id>b7314403a3c9f54acb4aad832f7c9c95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chakravarty S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d31b0d6ad112.63973397</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50B28783-4833-4435-AC2B-64CD3D2AE7E5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religious fragmentation, social identity and cooperation: Evidence from an artefactual field experiment in India</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Economic Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b5dd793bb0dfa22b21975b6a5e45269d"><gtr:id>b5dd793bb0dfa22b21975b6a5e45269d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chakravarty S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54c0b70020e428.30497261</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5061FA39-2888-40BD-8E61-BAE3C820C911</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religious Fragmentation, Social Identity and Conflict: Evidence from an Artefactual Field Experiment in India.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b5dd793bb0dfa22b21975b6a5e45269d"><gtr:id>b5dd793bb0dfa22b21975b6a5e45269d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chakravarty S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d56f13cc2b0.37014304</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J018643/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
