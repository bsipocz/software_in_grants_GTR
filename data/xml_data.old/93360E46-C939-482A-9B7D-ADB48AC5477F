It also aims to reduce their lifecycle cost. Air transport demand is predicted to double in the next 10 - 15 years and triple in 20 years time. In order to enable sustained growth, whilst limiting the environmental impact of air transport in the future, the Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE) has set challenging targets for emission levels from gas turbines. Improvements in efficiency and increased operating temperature capability are required to address these issues. The reduction in fuel burn anticipated from the project can be converted to a reduction of 836 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per aircraft per year. To achieve this large reduction a multifaceted approach is necessary. Hence, the project is split into a number of work packages (WP) covering cooling, aerodynamics, aeromechanical interaction and materials. The latter facilitates a wider design space for the former packages and hence all packages are interlinked. The project forms part of the larger SAMULET programme. The cross-disciplinary approach being taken, in this programme, is expected to deliver greater technical capability when compared to previous more narrowly defined research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>308126</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>60000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Rolls-Royce Plc</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Rolls Royce Group Plc</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>DD3C36B7-0488-4E04-8477-088F00FAE6C4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ec133c65ec133da</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has resulted in a new design shell facecoat which is being adopted for the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 aero-engine.

The hot, high pressure air entering the turbine causes large oxidative stress on the blades and measures must be taken to prevent damage and increase the lifetime of the blades. The addition of reactive rare earth metals such as yttrium and lanthanum to the blade alloy have a marked effect on the lifetime of the alloy in use by increasing its resistance to oxidation and on improving adhesion of the thermal barrier coating. High rates of loss with varying solifification times in a single component preclude attaining a relatively narrow range of acceptable dopant levels. Therefore less reactive mould and core materials are required. As Y and La are expensive overdosing is economically and environmentally unsound. Thus the aim of this project was to develop refractory systems which inhibit the element loss during casting and evaluate the process for reaction products and cast product uniformity. Initial experiments were conducted with conventional refractory materials to establish baseline data for rates of loss and reaction pathways. This work also enabled the analytical methods to be developed for characterising the interactions. It was found that the dynamic wetting behaviour of the metal in contact with the refractory could be correlated with the loss off Y and La from the alloy allowing rapid evaluation of new refractory compositions. Methods for estimating the doping element distribution in the metal and ceramic were developed using electron microscopy. Initial results confirm those of previous workers where less than 10% of added yttrium was retained in the single crystal alloy when cast in a standard shell. Losses could be compensated by over doping the alloy but non-uniform loss renders some sections over doped with detrimental effect on alloy properties. It was shown that the rate of loss depends on the cast environment as well as the selected refractory. Standard free energies of formation of various oxide materials were examined, allowing formulations of new shell/core materials to be developed. The data indicated limited options in pure oxides and new formulations were evaluated in the programme containing mixed oxide materials. Through application of background IP the range of candidate materials was expanded considerably. The results were very encouraging showing significant improvements in retention and uniformity. It has been demonstrated that the system made of silica and alumina, formulated to form mullite (3Al2O3 - 2SiO5) during sintering, showed similar behaviour to the current standard refractory system. A system combining silica mixed with low free energy oxides generated intermediate phases during sintering that proved to be more stable than a single oxide system of nominally lower free energy. Thus the ranking of the investigated formulations did not always follow the expected trend relative to free energy of formation of the oxides and hence there is a need for further investigation to develop detailed understanding of the kinetics and phase relationships from the data gathered in the mixed oxides and single oxide systems. This research developed understanding of ceramic systems which allow cost effective introduction of oxidation resistant alloys helping to maintain and advance UK competitiveness. A more uniform product through greater control of composition will lead to greater reliability.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The principal research partner (Rolls-Royce) required development of more inert moulds for casting of rare earth element doped nickel based superalloys. The scientific understandings established as a result of the project are being applied by them in an industrially sponsored follow on project to develop novel refractory material systems for casting of highly reactive alloys. Since completion the research has been translated to innovation in ceramic mould materials for net shape casting of gamma titanium aluminide alloy low pressure turbine blades for civil aeroengines. This has led to a number of publications in high quality journals, in which the techniques developed and reported findings are of use to others working in the field.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E52A5439-9FE4-4860-9509-5BD662F7CE28</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5744a0c0636e41.80104432</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9A2AE08E-7FB1-401B-A692-CFDD96602EB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investment casting of Ti-46Al-8Nb-1B alloy using moulds with CaO-stabilized zirconia face coat at various mould pre-heat temperatures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ceramics International</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c32838a5c38248ffe7f9a9b44cad9db0"><gtr:id>c32838a5c38248ffe7f9a9b44cad9db0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yuan C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7390ff922287.49015794</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G034907/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ED6338AE-3457-45D6-90CA-B994C3CF422B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aerodynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C7829C5-FA2A-4084-834D-56F41F83E977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Combustion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
