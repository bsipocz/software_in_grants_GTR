By focusing on the role and activity of children in amateur media, the project will have a unique conceptual focus allowing the investigators to explore an issue of central importance to the study of film and specifically amateur media: the role of children and 'childhood' in the construction of personal and public histories. Working within a specific national and geographic context - Scotland - the project will benefit from a defined yet distinctively diverse social and cultural heritage in which amateur film-making has played a fundamental role, involving families, well established cine-clubs and numerous civic, educational and other sponsored community projects. \nThe project therefore aligns itself with the developing interest in examining and exploring the representation of the child and childhood in visual media. Norris Nicholson's work on the North West Film Archive (2001) has suggested ways in which the presence, activity and contingent evidence provided by children in amateur film can demonstrate many of the social and physical changes within children's lives over the twentieth century. Similarly, a recent historical study of non-commercial films from the National Film Board of Canada, (Low, 2002) has explored Canadian children's experience both within the home and in institutional contexts. Low, in particular, is interested in the way in which the NFB films offer two kinds of evidence: first, they reveal how children were being projected and directed as future citizens (since many of the films had a pedagogical or social agenda) and second, that the films also revealed how children actually 'were' in the past. This project will develop Low's agenda and adapt his methodology and reframe it within a different national context and in relation to the more ad hoc and diverse range of films to be found in the Scottish Screen Archive (SSA). It will address the pre-history, or the origins of children's activity in what is now characterised as a new 'participatory culture' of media convergence. \nThe PI (Dr. Karen Lury) and the RF (Dr. Ryan Shand) have, respectively, expertise in interpreting childhood in relation to professional film and television and in the history and interpretation of amateur film. Working collaboratively on the existing films and with newly archived video material they will produce a unique, distinctive and valuable contribution to the study of amateur media.\nThere is a significant gap in the SSA which has a particular importance for the study of children and amateur media. At the present time, there are very few collections held in the archive of video material produced during 1980-2000. In specific relation to the proposed project, this later material is key evidence in the speculation as to whether there are identifiable changes in relation to the child's participation in amateur media during this significant time period and as a likely 'tipping point' in relation to children's activity as film-makers that begins to inform their more conventional employment as subjects or performers. In collaboration with staff at the SSA the research team will identify, source and archive this 'missing generation' of amateur media to be held as an extension to the existing body of films held at the SSA. As part of the National Library of Scotland (NLS) this material will be of historic and national importance. Crucially, these films will be vital to the understanding of the mediation of childhood in the latter part of the twentieth century and will foreground the history of children as film-makers which has largely been neglected. \nResearch findings and selected film material will be disseminated via the conventional academic routes of publishing and conferences, but the project will also develop a website, educational workshops and a targeted learning resource, as well as an exhibition for the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is intended to target a wide range of audiences and potential users: \n1. PERMANENT ADDITION TO A NATIONAL RESOURCE:The location, selection and archiving of a range of video material originating throughout Scotland will act as a permanent extension of the National Library of Scotland (NLS). Located in the Scottish Screen Archive (SSA) it will be of public, historic and national importance and will be of interest to a variety of users both immediately and in the future.The current archive is visited and used by many private individuals, community groups and academic researchers. Film and video material from the archive is also accessed by film and television companies on a regular basis (as in, for example, the BBC series 'Scotland on Film'). As the longevity of all video formats is very poor it is vital that this material is sourced and properly archived or this generation of media, and thus the evidence relating to key media making activities - with what were once 'new' technologies - will be lost. \n2. ENHANCING OBJECTIVES OF A PUBLIC BODY: The Scottish Screen Archive, as part of the National Library of Scotland, is a national resource which has academic, educational and public value in understanding and presenting key aspects of national life. The project, based in rigorous academic research, will seek every opportunity to make material available to appropriate audiences through exhibitions, talks and educational outreach, and through these activities to promote greater public engagement with the resources of the archive.\n3. TARGETED EDUCATIONAL IMPACTS:\ni) Workshops: The proposed programme of educational workshops will ensure that, where appropriate, material and findings from the project will be shared and disseminated to a variety of different user groups including school children and teachers. Venues here would include the Glasgow Film Theatre (GFT) and the Discovery Children's Film Festival in Dundee.The GFT have agreed to pilot and then facilitate the 'rolling out' of this workshop on a national basis. \nii) Interactive teaching material: On-line teaching materials - or a 'featured resource' relating to the project will be developed. The project budgets for a primary and high school teacher to be bought in to consult on the development of this resource, thus making sure that findings and research material are used and targeted effectively at school children participating in the Scotland on Screen (SoS) network. \n4. CONFERENCE AND SCREENINGS: The final conference will involve film-makers past and present (therefore both adults and children) and incorporate an associated schedule of film/video screenings which will be exhibited in the Department's own cinema. These screenings will be open to the general public as well as to conference attendees. \n5. EXHIBITION AT MUSEUM OF CHILDHOOD: To be launched in June 2013, the research team and the education officer at the SSA will work with the curator to develop and build an interactive display employing archive material at the popular Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh. This will advertise the projects findings to visitors to Scotland as well as school groups and other members of the public revealing the long history and dynamic character of amateur/non-professional film culture in Scotland. \n5. INTERACTIVE WEBSITE: The project's website will allow members of the public to identify themselves as potential donors, ultimately access selected digitized film clips and provide easily accessible information about the scope and related events of the project itself. Once the project is completed the site will not develop further but will continue to be available via the SSA's existing webpages.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>584152</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is an interactive exhibition installed at the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh which will run between September 2014 and May 2015.

From internal newsletter for the National Library of Scotland: 
Making Movies 

Seventy children and their families had the experience of creating their own thaumatrope at the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh on 15th October. The thaumatrope ('wonder turner') was a popular nineteenth century optical toy, regarded as a precursor to animation and filmmaking. 

The workshop had a seasonal Hallowe'en twist. Children were invited to create magical 'witches' jars' containing creepy-crawlies, fairies and eyeballs - although some children chose to make a Victorian carousel instead! The children who participated in the workshop had come from all over Scotland and there were also visitors from the Netherlands, Spain, Canada and Australia.

The workshop was created and delivered by Emily Munro, Learning and Outreach Officer for the Scottish Screen Archive, with assistance from Alice Heywood. Children (and many grandparents!) were also able to look at and handle different gauges of film and learn about the Scottish Screen Archive. 

The workshop was timed to coincide with the Museum of childhood's current exhibition 'Making Movies', a partnership project between the University of Glasgow, the Museum of Childhood and the Scottish Screen Archive. The exhibition runs until May 2015.

This allowed the research team to really understand the wider dimensions and the social and cultural context for amateur film-making. Scottish initiatives such as SKAMM (Scottish Kids are Making Movies) and community workshops, along with cine clubs were important in sustaining what we came to see as the 'shadow industry' or the 'hidden history' of non-commercial Scottish film-making.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The films (over 2000 titles) collected, digitized and now held by the National Library of Scotland's Moving Image Archive will be of use to academic researchers, film-makers and of interest to the general public.
