Whether it is a unique effect of the two-dimensionality or the high temperature superconductivity emerges due to the strain or doping from a substrate this discovery offers a viable building block for a modulated growth of high temperature superconductors - monolayer of FeSe. The assembly of functional materials from discrete building blocks gives competitive advantage for synthesis of solids with specific properties and structure. In this case reactions often can be carried out at ambient conditions when the structure, functionality and chemical integrity of each building block is preserved so they can act as set of modules to be re-connected retrospectively into a global functional network. This programme of work is designed to isolate monolayered FeSe species and to explore chemistry assisted pathways for integrating them as building blocks in conjunction with other 2D systems. In this capacity the functionality of the FeSe layer could be modulated on demand in an open-type synthetic platform simply by changing the layers sequence. This will be achieved by employing a unique ability of the layered 3D chalcogenides to be rendered to 2D atomically thin blocks and then be re-assembled into artificial architectures. We foresee that this research will shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity in single unit cell FeSe that is of fundamental scientific interest and, taking to account that there some hints that superconductivity in FeSe of is conventional in nature, may become a key to room temperature superconductivity. From more practical perspective the proposed research could help create a large-scale solution-based platform for manufacturing of high T superconducting films at ambient temperature and to address an important challenge associated with wider adaptation of current state-of-the-art high T superconductors: how to process brittle ceramics into high quality films on a conducting substrate at ambient temperature. Coupling FeSe layers with other inorganic monolayers of specific properties (e.g. ferromagnetic, semiconductor, insulator) can trigger interesting quantum proximity effects at interfaces. This creates opportunities for adaptation in quantum communication, quantum computing and photonics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>JeS Impact summary
Superconductivity is associated with the ability of a material to show zero electrical resistance below a characteristic critical temperature (Tc). The lack of electrical resistance permits to sustain electrical current indefinitely and generate exceptionally high electromagnetic fields. The latter marvellous property has been exploited technologically for making strong electromagnets with applications in medical care (magnetic resonance imaging), energy generation (engines for wind turbines) and pharmaceutical (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic separation). 
What has been often overlooked even by established academics and experienced presenters (e.g. in BBC documentaries) is that superconductivity can have transformative effect on future Quantum Technologies. For example, astrophysics has benefited strongly from the phenomena and new IR detectors stemmed from this fundamental research could become the basis of an agenda in electronic (sensors) industries. Therefore, it is important to shape the public awareness of the superconducting technology and this requires search for exciting quantum phenomena at the interfaces between superconductors and other functional materials. However, the ability to create such interface often requires the substantial investment into complex deposition apparatus and many researchers are afraid to pursue what they rightly see as a risky innovation. The proposed research aims to address this challenge by trying to identify chemistry assisted pathways to create novel superconductors. This will be achieved by employing a unique ability of the layered chalcogenides to be rendered to atomically thin blocks and then be re-assembled into artificial architectures with improved superconducting properties. The flexibility of this synthetic approach affords an open platform type of material where the function could be modulated on demand simply by changing the layers sequence. The impact of the project is therefore far-reaching, with our results of great interest to chemists, physicists and engineers working on graphene-related materials, nanostructured materials and energy storage materials. We will ensure our results reach the most appropriate audiences by engaging with our community through conference attendance and continuing to publish our results in high impact journals. The unique mix of synthetic capabilities, state-of-the-art characterisation techniques and possible device testing are at the cross section of important research area of the EPSRC physical science portfolio. This will have significant impact on the career development of the PDRA hired as a result of this funding. We believe that superconductors, if understood properly, hold a great potential in quantum technology and would offer the surest path to profitable economic and job growth. Our Pathways to Impact statement also highlights our proposed engagement with UoG research office in order to ensure that any developed method and materials of outstanding performance, which would arise as a result of this work, will be appropriately explored for market commercialisation. The closest proximity to the quantum technology hub QuantIC (University of Glasgow) would enable the progress of any commercially important outcome of this research in quantum imaging straight to the marketplace through Partnership Resource Grants.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100235</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F624F336-B86C-4925-91AF-F5437ACF3256</gtr:id><gtr:title>Molybdenum Ditelluride Rendered into an Efficient and Stable Electrocatalyst for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Polymorphic Control</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energy Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/19a287ad6fbb8a80cdb28dd79708c94b"><gtr:id>19a287ad6fbb8a80cdb28dd79708c94b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGlynn J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a1e91a73b04e1.81201612</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P001653/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
