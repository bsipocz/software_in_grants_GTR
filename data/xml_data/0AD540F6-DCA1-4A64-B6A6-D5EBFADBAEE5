While global access to improved drinking water sources has been expanding over the past decades, it is still lacking in many places, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, not all improved drinking water sources are safe. Water quality monitoring at the point of use is quintessential for the provision of safe water.
This project will develop innovative technologies for rapidly surveying, mapping and communicating waterborne hazards. Newcastle University in the UK will team up with Ardhi University in Tanzania, for the method development with subsequent field testing in Dar es Salaam, with the aim of establishing all methods and skills in the partner country Tanzania by the end of the project. The project will develop portable gene sequencing equipment as a versatile technology to comprehensively assess microbial water quality within a matter of hours. It will embed this molecular microbiological method with other field deployable methods for assessing water quality, including inexpensive screening methods, to derive cost effective and reliable surveying strategies.
The water quality assessment methods will be integrated with digital technologies for data storage in a remote database, and immediate data curation, interpretation and visualization, firstly to assist surveyors with their field work, and secondly to make surveying data accessible to the public. A hazard communication tool will be developed with location aware, multi-platform hazard maps, augmented by in-app links to a repository of contextual information, including health impacts, practical advice, observational metadata and WHO information. The development will be &amp;quot;mobile-first&amp;quot; such that designs fit a variety of mobiles and tablets. The use of CSS and modern browser technology will ensure that the same applications can be deployed automatically to multiple devices with the content being dynamically selected (or reduced) depending on the device capabilities.
The water quality surveying equipment and methods, together with the associated digital technologies, will be field-tested in four surveys of increasing complexity of different water sources in unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. According to UNICEF, 46% of Tanzanians still lack access to improved drinking water sources. Waterborne diseases are endemic in Tanzania and a major disease burden, as evidenced by the major cholera outbreak in Dar es Salaam and other Tanzanian regions in the summer and autumn of 2015, which affected thousands of people. In this project, local stakeholders like the Dar es Salaam Water &amp;amp; Sewerage Authority, school teachers and community representatives will be engaged in the technology development and testing, helping in particular with the identification of context-appropriate, useful hazard communication methods. Multiple visual waterborne hazard display options will for example be scrutinized by these stakeholders to explore their social acceptability as well as easy interpretability and usefulness. Ardhi University researchers will assist with the translation of key contextual information into local languages.
The methods and technologies developed in this project will not only facilitate water quality monitoring and communication in low income countries like Tanzania, where waterborne diseases are a significant health burden, but they will also facilitate the emergency response to natural or human-made disasters such as major earthquakes, the displacement of people by conflicts, or terrorist attacks affecting water supplies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will develop new water quality monitoring methods and strategies and establish these tools and skills at Ardhi University in Tanzania. It will augment existing water, sanitation and hygiene research skills and capabilities at Ardhi University through the training of research staff in modern, molecular microbiology and the use of digital technologies for the automatic curation and interpretation and mapping of data, and through the testing of these innovative water quality surveying methods and strategies in four field surveys of increasing sophistication in unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam. By the end of this project, seven young Tanzanian researchers, and two UK researchers will have been trained in waterborne hazard assessment, mapping and communication. 
Building on the trust and links established with local stakeholders through previous research in Dar es Salaam, a waterborne hazard communication application will be developed to make water quality survey findings readily accessible and useful to the public. With three stakeholder workshops, representatives of the local water and sewerage authority, community representatives, and school teachers will be engaged in the appraisal of different formats and visual display options for making water quality data understandable to the public. The social acceptability and relative usefulness of different communication options will be scrutinized with the help of these stakeholders from early on in the project. The digital waterborne hazard maps developed in this project will include embedded links to repositories of contextual information such as practical advice and links to WHO guidance documents. Key messages will be translated into local languages by the Ardhi University researchers, and also be recorded as audio messages. 
Downloadable open source applications and open access scientific publications will facilitate the take-up of our research outcomes by other users. With the help of digital technologies we will provide public access to our waterborne hazard maps and underpinning data. Publicly available waterborne hazard maps will help local authorities target their investments in improved water infrastructures, where these are the most urgently needed, and the data can be scrutinized and used by many others such as the health authorities, school teachers, epidemiologists, NGOs and by scientists for interdisciplinary research, thus multiplying the opportunities for discoveries and advancements. Our ultimate aim for impact is to assist deprived communities living in unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam, and elsewhere, with making life-saving decisions in their daily life about which water source to use for which purpose (i.e. drinking and food preparation versus household cleaning). Mobile device usage is rapidly expanding in low income countries, and Dar es Salaam as well as other East African cities have the ambition to provide free wireless internet access in busy public places such as hospitals and shopping malls, thus providing access points for waterborne hazard communication to potentially millions of people. An informed public will also be empowered to demand change and social justice where governments fail to deliver affordable access to safe water for all.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>477153</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P028527/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19789484-D6B8-4965-AD25-309DD43054A0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Water Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
