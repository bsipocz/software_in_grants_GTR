A substantial increase in the critical mass of researchers with appropriate interdisciplinary training, capable of working across the various phases of translational research has been identified as one of the key factors required to increase the impact of scientific innovation on human health. We will invest in 17 young African and UK researchers from multiple disciplines who have the creativity, intellect and determination to make a lasting impact on reducing the burden of vector borne disease. We will allocate resources to promote cohesion between these researchers to increase opportunities for collaboration between disciplines and between countries. Each researcher supported will recruit and train at least two additional junior researchers, further building capacity.

The PIIVeC applicants have an exemplary track record in supporting the careers of young vector biologists in Africa and a firm commitment to providing long term support, e.g. 11 of the 14 recipients of Wellcome Trust Public Health and Tropical Medicine Training and Intermediate Fellowships in this discipline over the past four years were supported by Vector Biology Department at LSTM. However, recognising the challenges in establishing research careers in resource poor settings, this proposal will go beyond supporting the individual scientist by also strengthening institutional capacity to build a vibrant environment to retain excellent African scientists.

Knowledge
The outputs of the research of PIIVeC will lead to evidence-based strategies to tackle multiple vector borne diseases using the most cost effective, sustainable and locally appropriate/ acceptable tools. By strengthening the design and implementation of vector control trials, including the accreditation of at least one field site to international good laboratory practice (GLP) standards, we will accelerate the translational pathway. Enhanced surveillance tools, coupled with advanced mapping approaches will transform each country's ability to plan routine control programmes and respond to outbreaks of vector borne disease.
 
Integration
Rather than evaluating control tools in isolation, we will take a holistic overview of the strategies needed to design and implement an integrated, sustainable and effective package of interventions for controlling multiple vector borne diseases. Each of our three partner countries will establish multi sectorial technical vector control advisory groups (TVCAGs) to enhance integration of disease control planning and implementation. In all countries, control programmes are currently disease specific, and often run and managed by external providers. However many interventions can target multiple diseases and supporting and empowering the TVCAGs will lead to a more efficient and integrated disease control strategy in country.

Partnership
LSTM has an excellent track record of providing long-term support and mentorship to strengthen the research base in Africa. We have worked with each PIIVeC partner for multiple years on numerous projects but this call provides a unique opportunity to consolidate those partnerships by integrating expertise from multiple disciplines. Capacity to tackle VBDs is in critically short supply in all three partner countries, particularly in Malawi, where there is only one PhD public health entomologist currently active in the entire country (Mzilahowa, co-PI on the current application) and where capacity in allied disciplines is also in extremely short supply. PIIVeC will strengthen south-south partnerships, promoting the secondment of scientists from Burkina Faso and Cameroon, to build capacity in Malawi. In this way we will build three regional hubs, in West, Central and Southern Africa. By investing in the enhancement of research management skills, we will also strengthen our partners' capacity to successfully compete independently for significant international funding.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6325569</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P027873/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>FB395309-E202-4FE8-87B0-041A3D72D4D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.5  Research design and methodologies (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93C4699B-9E5C-4982-9CCC-EFD5B9712D6E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.6  Resources and infrastructure (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
