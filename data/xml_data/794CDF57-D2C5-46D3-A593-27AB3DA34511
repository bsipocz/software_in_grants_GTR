By far the largest percentage of our energy is produced via combustion equipment such as internal combustion engines for cars, turbines for aircraft or industrial burners for power generation. These processes also account for the generation of a wide variety of pollutants, such as NOx and soot, as well as for the generation of greenhouse gases. It is widely acknowledged that there is large potential for improvement of those processes, resulting in great environmental benefits. Combustion modelling requires the coupling of fluid dynamics equations, solved numerically through a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, with a comprehensive chemical kinetics model. Practical combustion devices are invariably turbulent, which necessitates a further element, the turbulence-chemistry interaction model. Coupling all of these elements results in a formidable computational problem, and the main cause of the bottleneck is the chemical kinetics part of the calculation. Comprehensive chemical kinetics include very large numbers of species and reactions: even for the simplest fuels, such as methane, more than 50 species are necessary, while for commercial fuels hundreds of species and reactions can easily be present. Each species introduces an additional differential equation to the problem, and integration is further hampered by the excessive stiffness that is often exhibited by such systems. Yet the incorporation of comprehensive mechanisms is essential if the formation of pollutants is to be predicted. The mathematical modelling of combustion can be significantly simplified by taking advantage of the time scale separation to assume that fast reactions, typically associated with intermediate species, are in a state of local equilibrium. The proposed research will explore a promising concept for deriving the low-dimensional models on the basis of time-scale separation: Rate-Controlled Constrained Equilibrium (RCCE). In this approach, the kinetically controlled species are allowed to evolve according to the relevant differential equations including the chemical kinetics of the original detailed mechanism, whilst the equilibrated species are determined by minimising the free energy of the mixture, subject to the additional constraints (apart from conservation of mass, energy and elements) that the kinetically controlled species must retain the concentrations given by the solution of their governing equations. Previous work by the authors has provided evidence that RCCE has the potential to develop into a method that is both theoretically rigorous and practically feasible for the implementation of large chemical mechanisms into CFD codes. Having established proof of concept, further work is now required to bring RCCE to the stage where it is ready for application in practical problems. Furthermore, several important questions about the fundamentals of RCCE remain unanswered, such as its relation to other methods of mechanism reduction such as Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP). The two methods are complementary and it is possible that a combination of them will prove a very powerful tool.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>105182</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>250000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Clear Skies: Dreamcode</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>SP1-JTI-CS-2013-01-620143</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>22518CA6-0541-4ED0-944F-2E424B60050D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ec6afd65ec6afea</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>LES of industrial gas turbines</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9BF3EDA7-9779-4485-9059-1E0D184DC571</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ebfeaf25ebfeb06</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>250000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Clear Skies: Dreamcode</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>SP1-JTI-CS-2013-01-620143</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>574F2CEB-132D-4408-938B-657CA2E063DC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6822454144.08152306a14a14</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>LES of industrial gas turbines</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Siemens AG</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4EAA3CFB-42E0-4A88-AB68-89F518215DE1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6607235788.0018990689bfc0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Modelling of combustion processes is an outstanding technical problem with wide implications, both scientific and practical. In excess of 90% of our energy is produced via the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels in such equipment as internal combustion engines for cars, gas-turbine engines for aircraft, industrial gas-turbines for power generation and furnaces for cement production and electrical power generation, a situation that is likely to prevail for the foreseeable future. Combustion processes also account for the generation of a wide variety of pollutants, such as oxides of Nitrogen and soot, as well as for the generation of greenhouse gases. It is widely acknowledged that there is large potential for the improvement of combustion processes, resulting in great environmental benefits. Mathematical modelling of Combustion requires coupling of equations describing fluid motion together with a comprehensive description of chemical reaction, with the resulting system of partial differential equations being solved numerically with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package. Combustion processes are invariably turbulent, and their prediction requires a turbulence-chemistry interaction model. Coupling all of these elements results in a formidable computational problem, in which the main cause of the bottleneck is the chemical kinetics part of the calculation, where a very large numbers of species and reactions are involved, each species requiring an extra differential equation to be solved. 

This project has resulted in significant steps towards the renationalisation of the long-term aim of developing a methodology for computer modelling of reactive flows and pollutant production in realistic turbulent flow conditions. Central to this methodology is the concept of Rate-Controlled Constrained Equilibrium (RCCE) for deriving the low-dimensional models on the basis of time-scale separation. RCCE allows us to describe combustion using a model that, although derived from a comprehensive and detailed chemical mechanism, consists of much fewer variables. An important parameter in RCCE is the choice of the reduced variables, and for this reason we explored the potential of a synergy between RCCE and Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) - a method for investigating the time scales associated with various chemical species and determining which ones should be retained in the RCCE-derived reduced mechanism. The concept proved fruitful, and good results were obtained for the simulation of laminar premixed flames, an ideal test case to prove the value of the concept. Even the reduced model requires a significant amount of time to be integrated, however, and for this purpose we developed an approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for replacing the real-time integration of the RCCE differential equations with an algebraic model, trained with results from model computations. The development of a methodology for generating training sets for ANNs and the generation and training of them in an appropriate way for predicting the conditions encountered in turbulent flames was a major outcome of the project. The ANN approach was tested and excellent results were obtained. The method has been incorporated into a Combustion Large Eddy Simulation method utilizing a state-of-the-art stochastic fields method for describing sub-grid scale turbulence-chemistry interactions.

This was a collaborative project involving Imperial College, EP/G05679X/1 and Manchester University, Dr S Rigopoulos, EP/G057311/1. Dr Rigopoulos subsequently moved to Imperial College, EP/G057311/2</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Combustion Large Eddy Simulation based on the sub-grid probability equation/stochastic fields method is currently being used by several European gas turbine manufacturers and there is a strong need for accurate and detailed, but simplified chemistry. The research on RCCE provides a means of incorporating this. The method is also of potential value to the manufacturers of reciprocating engines and furnaces. An important long-term aspiration of the Combustion industry is to be able to predict, at the design stage, the performance and reliability of new combustion chambers, the achievement of which is likely to lead to appreciable improvements in design. The practical benefits this would bring are large and include reduction of carbon dioxide emissions released to the environment, significant reductions in costs for many industries, such as those involved in transport, power generation and chemical processing, because of their ability to meet emission targets and reduce their Carbon Tax liability and more economical manufacturing through elimination of over-design. The life cycle cost analysis and reliability and availability of power plants is becoming a key issue in the quest for a sustainable global environment. Currently the design of combustors is carried out essentially by empirical means usually followed by extensive experimental testing and the ability of computer models to assist the design is limited. Although, computer based simulation methods are an integral part of the design approach for other parts of power plants (e.g. turbines, compressors, heat exchangers etc.), their inability to predict combusting flows has not allowed a similar confidence to be developed in this area. A major reason for this has been related to an inability to provide a sufficiently detailed description of chemical reaction. The research conducted has provided a means of overcoming this difficulty and thus allows the development of accurate and reliable simulation methods to be used as an important aid to the design of efficient and low emissions combustion systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6E8D0FB0-37A2-42C5-BE76-701AD642916B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5803492195.72124377483994</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F4DD3E9B-65CF-4921-A912-894A04B3EAA8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modelling of soot formation in laminar diffusion flames using a comprehensive CFD-PBE model with detailed gas-phase chemistry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Combustion Theory and Modelling</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0f51f4d8e6c59c89709c1a43f5cf424"><gtr:id>e0f51f4d8e6c59c89709c1a43f5cf424</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Akridis P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6aa0ad064a5.38345638</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CB1DF81B-07F6-4E74-85AB-309C64D4795D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Large-eddy simulation of spray combustion in a gas turbine combustor</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Combustion and Flame</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/46f39f1a490e05c57b42ca880663413a"><gtr:id>46f39f1a490e05c57b42ca880663413a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfeafea09dccd0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G05679X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C7829C5-FA2A-4084-834D-56F41F83E977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Combustion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
