It develops the idea of 'connectivity' within and across communities that are transnational and diasporic, focusing on four key areas: community histories; home, community and migration; cities, communities and connections; and faith communities and religious diasporas. As an integral part of the research review (see Bonnerjee et al., 2011, for the full report), four one-day workshops on these themes were held in partnership with The Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) and The Geffrye Museum of the Home. These workshops (two at the RGS-IBG, one at The Geffrye and one at The City Centre, QMUL) brought together more than 70 participants from across the academic, arts/cultural and community sectors and involved a range of presentations, workshop activities and discussions about future collaborative research priorities.

Since 2011, the centre has had 11 funded collaborative PhD students (AHRC, ESRC, QMUL) and four postdoctoral research fellows (AHRC, Arts Council, Leverhulme Trust, QMUL). Its regular activities include a monthly seminar series at the Institute of Historical Research; annual conferences, research-in-progress days, postgraduate study days and lectures; and a reading group on home led by PGRs and ECRs. Collaborative outputs include exhibitions and displays (including 'Who once lived in my house?' 2013-14, and planned exhibitions on domestic service, the Aylesbury Estate and teenage bedrooms); publications (including special issues of Home Cultures on 'Domestic practice in the past' and 'For home unmaking' and a guide to collaborative work on exhibitions); the development of learning resources (including on 'the servant problem' for school sessions); the reinterpretation of the permanent galleries (particularly about the relationships between home and work); outreach work (including with Vietnamese residents in Hackney); and enhancements to the collections in the form of historical material and the creation of new archives consisting of interviews and photographs generated by the contemporary research projects. The centre's online research register has 184 entries, including 47 from overseas (including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden and the USA).

Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). It sought to bring together an
interest in public and private connections within and between communities, alongside
the importance of connections both 'here' and 'there'. Focusing on the discussion of
religious practices, buildings and communities, the workshop explored the ways in
which faith can open up points of connection across communities, places and
generations. Building on the Women's Design Service 'Faith in Action' project, the
workshop also focused on the importance of gender in shaping faith communities
and religious diasporas as well as generation, race and ethnicity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0ac30336a87.09802864</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.geog.qmul.ac.uk/docs/research/61819.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>One-day workshop on 'Community histories: connections and collaborations' at the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B997ADF8-4B74-4FBB-90CB-4C8BBBA025AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop explored resources, methods and strategies for collecting,

workshop explored public and urban spaces of encounter, connection and exchange,
focusing on workplaces, sites of consumption and leisure spaces. One key theme

distance, connection and disconnection, both within and between different
communities.

become a central focus of research on diaspora and transnationality, spanning
home-making practices, domestic architecture, material culture and wider senses of
belonging and dwelling in the world. This workshop brought together academics,
members of community organizations and those working in the arts and cultural
sector who are interested in the connections between home, migration and
community. The day was held in partnership with The Geffrye Museum of the Home
and the Centre for Studies of Home (the latter, a partnership between Queen Mary
and the Geffrye) which provided resources for exploring the issues through
a range of media.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0aaa0cfe160.38892806</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.geog.qmul.ac.uk/docs/research/61819.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>60000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>5C15236A-B503-41DC-B49A-D05B59807332</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e095e7c07466.50448046</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research findings have been used to underpin future collaborative research applications with both partner organizations:

? To develop collaborative research across the academic, arts/cultural and community sectors, and the recognition that those working in each sector bring a range of skills and experience particularly in terms of methodological
innovation, community engagement and dissemination strategies.
? To foster dialogue and knowledge exchange about innovative methodologies developed across each sector, particularly in terms of working with objects and displays in museums (eg RGS-IBG collections, and the period rooms and
collections of The Geffrye Museum of the Home), performative and other artistic practices (eg the intergenerational work of Magic Me and the performance work involved in Ali Campbell's Living Map project), and a wide range of participatory and pedagogic techniques (eg interfaith workshops organized by Three Faiths Forum).
? To develop research on different spaces and scales of connection for transnational and diasporic communities, in particular building on projects that have focused on particular places (eg The World in the East End, V&amp;amp;A Museum of Childhood, The Swadhinata Trust's project on Bengalis in the
East End, and the work of Eastside Community Heritage) and on connections over transnational and diasporic scales (eg Crossing Continents: Connecting Communities, RGS-IBG; Stories of the World: Home, Geffrye; Stories of the
World: Journeys, London Transport Museum).
? To build on the links established between workshop participants to develop collaborative community engagement projects about diasporic and transnational connections across the academic, arts/cultural and community sectors.
? To develop new collaborative research grant applications under the Connected Communities programme to examine:
1) Mapping connections across time and space: exploring community histories across generations among migrant groups in London;
2) Connecting faith across space in the city: the role of arts/cultural events in promoting inter-faith dialogue;
3) Home, migration and community: home as a site of inclusion and exclusion for migrant communities and the connections between home, work and the wider city
? To build on the partnership between QMUL, the RGS-IBG and The Geffrye Museum of the Home via the QMUL-led AHRC knowledge exchange hub, Creativeworks London, in which both other organisations are named partners.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EECF06CC-6B33-46A4-95D9-EB3299EA38E4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0ae83a1a253.52067692</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.geog.qmul.ac.uk/docs/research/61819.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>25F926D6-F457-4827-814F-68C7B7B86357</gtr:id><gtr:title>Connected communities: diaspora and transnationality</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9bf1ee106f9a661624390aea513b6d2e"><gtr:id>9bf1ee106f9a661624390aea513b6d2e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bonnerjee, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e0a7c9eb8485.79314923</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J50062X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
