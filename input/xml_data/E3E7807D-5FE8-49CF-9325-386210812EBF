Based on Dr. Zaum?s research on both corruption and peacebuilding, and the political economy of peace- and statebuilding, the fellowship aims to summarise and evaluate the evidence of the impact of corruption on stabilisation, and of the practices of stabilisation actors on corruption, and make this information available to stabilisation practitioners. In addition, it aims to introduce new analytical perspectives on corruption in fragile states that can assist stabilisation and governance advisors in their analysis of corruption in stabilisation environments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The knowledge-transfer is facilitated through both written outputs (a literature review, an analytical paper, and a short guidance note for stabilisation practitioners), and through a range of briefings and workshops in the stabilisation unit and its parent departments (Department for International Development, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and Ministry of Defence)&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research has informed debates and thinking about corruption in fragile and conflict-affected countries, and about corruption and statebuilding and stabilisation in DFID and the Stabilisation Unit, and has had impact that way. While the research has been communicated more widely to international audiences, and given especially DFID's influential role in development thinking and practice, it is likely that the actual impact if wider, but is not possible to evidence this at this stage. Consequently, the focus is solely on the two institutions where credible evidence for impact can be provided. The impact that is claimed from this project is not that it has changed UK or more specifically DFID's anti-corruption policy: DFID has officially a &amp;quot;zero-tolerance&amp;quot; policy towards corruption, and this is neither changed nor challenged by this project. Instead, it has had a twofold impact on internal debates around corruption and statebuilding/stabilisation. First, at a time where addressing corruption has become a key priority of DFID's work, it has informed debates about what works and does not work with regard to donor-funded anti-corruption efforts. Second, it has contributed to a recognition that there needs to be a better understanding of the complex roles of corruption on security, governance, and economic development in fragile and conflict-affected states, and that anti-corruption efforts need to be conflict-sensitive.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F29C9857-E58E-401F-80BF-4E6BBF87D0EE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5453b63a4ab652.87992946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findingof the project include:
 ? Some forms of corruption can, at least in the short and medium term, be stabilising, and efforts to counter them can fuel instability and violence. Other forms of corruption can prevent the emergence of a stable political and economic settlement. 
? Stabilisation efforts can entrench corruption, and shape its organisation, e.g. through political settlements negotiated with external support, the aid and financial support stabilisation actors give, and the governance reforms they promote. 
? Reducing corruption is a long-term task, where marked but modest progress can take a decade. Especially in stabilisation environments, where corruption is often a rational response to the uncertainties and insecurities of daily life, rapid progress with reducing corruption is unlikely. 
? Anti-corruption efforts need to be integrated within wider stabilisation practices, balanced against other objectives, and understood in the light of to how corruption relates to these different objectives. 
? Changing the political economy that fuels corruption requires the development of incentives for elites to formalise their power and build institutions. 
? Stabilisation actors should focus on establishing an institutional and political framework within which longer-term state- and peace-building processes can continue anti-corruption reforms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>cited in policy papers and debates</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E7B9F752-7394-456E-B022-4D0AE140E3AE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5453b72eb5f026.21062905</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>760FFCE0-F554-4C2D-9AF8-CA4D36E4BC1E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Routledge Handbook of International Statebuilding</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a9e59ea29b84e45112151a3684bc8433"><gtr:id>a9e59ea29b84e45112151a3684bc8433</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chandler, David; Sisk, Timothy D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-67702-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-8288754940.3018843b98a63a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-173-27-0249</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J000418/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
