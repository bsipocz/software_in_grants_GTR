Two of the most important goals of Transformation for Growth are:

1. To capture the learning and good practice from the implementation of The Growth Pathway and The Transformation Toolkits
2. To disseminate them regionally, nationally and internationally to all organisations, especially Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), given we worked with SMEs for this Project

Together with Durham University's Policy Research Group, based jointly between St. Chad's College and Durham University Business School, we have written 21 case studies. 12 of the most successful case studies have, in addition, been succinctly summarised in talking head videos or 'how to' guides for transformation. There are 5 longer in-depth videos, and 7 shorter key-message videos.

The case studies are in the following order, all alphabetically listed:

5 longer in-depth videos with written case studies

? the toolsets enabled Warwickshire Police to identify problem areas and measures to address them
? the new ANPR schemes were successfully implemented in 2010 on time and within budget
? between 2010 and 2012, the Coventry Airport ANPR scheme identified 646,172 vehicles of interest to police, while the Nuneaton ANPR scheme identified a further 423,285 vehicles
? the schemes have provided vital evidence for high profile cases including murder, rape, wounding, major fraud, theft and armed robberies. They have also led to the recovery of a police vehicle stolen from Northampton, the identification of an organised crime group engaged in the theft of caravans across the Midlands and the successful prosecution of an organised crime group involved in insurance fraud

CHAMPS2 is modified as a 4 Stage Process for smaller organisations, such as Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In order to successfully pass from one stage to the next, a stage gate needs to be completed. This is an audit of your achievements in the previous stage, and an action plan for the next.

The Benefits to SMEs from Using the 4 Stage Process

The 4 Stage Process is now a proven, vision led, benefit driven business change method that can enable organisations of any size to undergo change, whilst developing the in-house expertise to do so. It supports holistic change across processes, organisation structure, technology and data.

The key strengths of the 4 Stage Process are that it focuses on defining and then realising outcomes. It is therefore an important tool in helping organisations to redesign an approach to service delivery, whilst continuing to focus on what is important from a customer perspective.

The 4 Stage Process is designed to review all aspects of service delivery. It not only provides a structured approach to delivering change, it is also flexible and can be adapted for use in a range of change initiatives of any scale.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9826B113-4525-42DD-A05E-F134FA315B1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Between September 2013 and July 2015 the impact of the ERDF Transformation for Growth Project was:
