The project explores the specific potential of the 'Violectra' electric violin as an instrument of avant-garde contemporary music in combination with advanced real-time DSP techniques; the integration of instrument-specific timbres and virtuosic extended techniques with interactive, real-time synthesis software, using established and customized computer music tools. Composer/computer musician Dr Nick Collins (University of Sussex) provided technical assistance with system construction and evaluation, in particular through the programming of machine listening and learning techniques in order to facilitate a more intelligent musical responsiveness in the Max/MSP patches. This software development enables the online learning of gestures (automatic clustering of textures and gestures) in an adaptable stand-alone module, existing as a Max/MSP external object (ll~). 

The project created a brand new work 'Adaptations' (2011) for electric violin and interactive computer, as well as extensively developing and revising Hayden's 'schismatics' (2007, rev. 2010) for electric violin and live electronics (the existing fruit of this collaboration). This piece is now an interactive (as opposed to reactive) work, with greater computer agency and autonomy, utilizing machine learning and listening techniques. Both works involve a more (artificially) intelligent computer as 'virtual' performer whose output is more 'musical' (as defined by the project collaborators), with more differentiated sonic textures and processes. These developments were achieved through a combination of regular documented studio sessions with development periods and email/telephone communication in between these practical sessions.

Outputs include: (a) an extensive reworking of 'schismatics' (2007, rev. 2010), including a complete redesign and radical overhaul of the internal technical workings of the Max/MSP patch (using IRCAM and 3rd party real-time analysis / synthesis objects) as well as significant improvements to the user interface, performer feedback mechanisms (including visual) and hardware set-up (such as the addition of performer control using a mouse pedal); (b) the production of a flexible software performance tool that could be used in other musical situations such as improvisations; (c) the creation of an entirely new work, 'Adaptations' (2011), using this flexible computer-based performance tool in combination with composed musical notation; (d) a co-authored journal article (Proc. of ICMC 2011) discussing findings arising from the specifics of the project, including advice of a general nature concerning the creative process, collaboration and techniques used; (e) the online publication to open-source communities of machine learning module; (f) the online publication of performance patches in compiled versions subject to copyright restrictions (public versions of patches available online will use open-source externals).

Through this practice-led research, a greater understanding of the potential of live performance involving the Violectra e-violin with real-time DSP has been gained. The project has addressed a range of detailed research questions, which can be divided into aesthetic/philosophical and practical/technical issues -- although the distinction is necessarily blurred since these categories feed off each other symbiotically. In essence, the nature of 'interactivity' in a specific musical context between solo performer (e-violin) and computer has been explored and the successful integration of live performance and real-time DSP has be defined in practical, technical and aesthetic terms, thus developing the collaboration between Sam Hayden and Mieko Kanno to to its full potential.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will not only benefit the investigators' immediate professional circle of contemporary music specialists carrying out related research within the academic context (composers, performers, computer musicians and creative audio programmers etc), but will also benefit the wider community of non-academic composers, other performers (e.g. those involved with improvised music, classical music, sound art, jazz and popular musics), as well as a much wider community of interested amateur musicians, concert-going audiences and those interested in contemporary culture in general (e.g. curators of contemporary music festivals, art spaces/galleries and other non-traditional art/performance contexts). Computer music technicians, programmers and software developers will also be able to reflect on an innovative creative application of their software tools, encouraging further software development. This project will benefit other researchers by at once enhancing the cross-disciplinary fields of composition, live-performance and computer music through the creative integration of the solo electric violin and interactive computer, a combination not yet adequately investigated in an academic context. Through this practice-led research, a greater understanding of the creative potential of live performance using the e-violin with real-time DSP will be gained. The appreciation of the musical potential of the electric violin will benefit specialist musicians and the non-specialist concert-going public audiences alike by going beyond its traditional cultural associations with popular music and jazz into the contemporary and computer music genres. The project will also potentially benefit the manufacturers of electric violins, by encouraging the use of the e-violin and other electric string instruments by contemporary music specialists, performers and composers, exposing the instrument to markets beyond the conception of the instrument with its established associations with popular music and jazz. The compositional outputs (Dr Sam Hayden's compositions 'schismatics II' and the new work) will utilise a custom-built, yet flexible and highly portable hardware/software set-up that could be usable in future projects involving other musical situations involving the e-violin (such as improvisation and sound installations). The project outcomes will encourage musical experimentation with the e-violin from musicians, concert promoters and music festivals and significant new music organisations interested in expanding audiences and challenging traditional musical boundaries. The international public dissemination of the project outcomes through public performances within and outside of the UK, within and outside of the academic context, such as at new music festivals, via commercial CD recordings, mp3 downloads, potential radio broadcasts, and the journal article will guarantee that the projects has a significant impact on specialist and non-specialist audiences alike, contributing to contemporary cultural life, in and beyond the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Performance of Composition for Electric Violin and Interactive Computer by Mieko Kanno (Violectra) and Sam Hayden (Computer)

20:00 [Concert] Programme included Sam Hayden's schismatics II (2010) and Adaptations (2011) for electric violin and interactive computer, performed by Mieko Kanno (e-violin) and Sam Hayden (computer). 

10/01/2014 13:00, RCS, Glasgow
13:00 [Concert] Contemporary solo violin programme by Mieko Kanno included Sam Hayden's Adaptations (2011) for electric violin and interactive computer, performed by Mieko Kanno (e-violin) and Sam Hayden (computer). 

The aim of this project was to investigate musical interactions that integrate the compositional ideas of the investigator [SH] with the idiosyncrasies of the Violectra electric violin in the context of live performance with real-time digital signal processing (DSP). The project continues an established collaboration between Hayden and Kanno. The primary objective was to fulfill the potential of this collaboration through the creation of original compositions for this media, using appropriate software tools for innovative creative outcomes, in Collaboration with Dr Nick Collins.

This research project represents the continuation of an ongoing, productive and successful collaboration between violinist, Dr Mieko Kanno (formerly Durham University, now RCS), and composer, Dr Sam Hayden (formerly of University of Sussex and Durham University, now Trinity Laban Conservatoire). The project explored the specific potential of the 'Violectra' electric violin as an instrument of avant-garde contemporary music in combination with advanced real-time DSP techniques; the integration of instrument-specific timbres
and virtuosic extended techniques with interactive, real-time synthesis software, using established and customized computer music tools. Composer/computer musician Dr Nick Collins (formerly University of Sussex, now Durham University) provided technical assistance with system construction and evaluation, in particular through the programming of machine listening and learning techniques in order to facilitate a more intelligent musical responsiveness in the Max/MSP patches. This software development enables the online learning of gestures (automatic clustering of textures and gestures) in an adaptable stand- alone module, existing as a Max/MSP external object (ll~).

The project created a brand new work 'Adaptations' (2011) for electric violin and interactive computer, as well as extensively developing and revising Hayden's 'schismatics' (2007, rev. 2010) for electric violin and live electronics (the existing fruit of this collaboration). This piece ('schismatics II') is now an interactive (as opposed to reactive) work, with greater computer agency and autonomy, utilizing machine learning and listening techniques. Both works involve a more (artificially) intelligent computer as 'virtual' performer whose output is more 'musical' (as defined by the project collaborators), with more differentiated sonic textures and processes. These developments were achieved through a combination of regular documented studio sessions with development periods and email/telephone communication in between these practical sessions.

Through this practice-led research project, a greater understanding of the potential of live performance involving the Violectra e-violin with real-time DSP has been gained. In essence, the nature of 'interactivity' in a specific musical context between solo performer (e-violin) and computer has been defined and explored, the MaxMSP patches evaluated qualitatively in terms of criteria such as 'ease of use', 'responsiveness', 'musicality', 'reliability', 'predictability of response', 'timbral variation' and so on. The successful integration of live performance and real-time DSP has been explored in practical, technical and aesthetic terms, thus developing the collaboration between Dr Sam Hayden and Dr Mieko Kanno to to its full potential.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The software (MaxMSP patches) developed for 'Adaptations' can be freely downloaded from above URL and used for the development of new notated compositions or improvisation contexts by other composers and musicians.
