Beliefs.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L003082/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project is exploring the impact of the behavioural sciences (including psychology, behavioural economics, and neuroscience) on the design and delivery of public policy.&amp;nbsp;This project has three aims:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to explore the extent to which the behavourial sciences are informing public policy initiatives across the world&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to assess how effective related behaviour change initiatives are and what methods are being used to monitor and understand their effectiveness&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to consider the extent to which it is possible to develop alternative effective and empowering ways of changing behaviours?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Focusing on six international case studies (Australia, Denmark, France, Netherlands, USA, and India), this project will conduct approximately 50 elite-level, in-depth interviews with policy executives in these countries. Following this international research, this project will develop a series of behavioural interventions (involving meditative techniques and related forms of behavioural training). These interventions will explore the extent to which it is possible to use the insights of the behavioural sciences to empower individuals to more effectively control their own behaviour. These behavioural interventions will be assessed using a mix of participant observation techniques, in-depth interviews and quantitative measures of personal value changes.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project is a transformative study of the increasing use of psychological and neurological insights to frame public policy interventions in a large number of states. Moreover, this is a topic of enquiry in which the non-academic impact of academic research has been especially prevalent to date; witnessed most clearly in the use made of key academic texts such as Nudge within public policy and the role played by 'celebrity' academics in popularising notions of behaviour change. As such, we are confident that there is a considerable appetite within public policy circles for additional academic insights concerning the utility of, and challenges associated with, a behaviour change agenda; one that we will be able to exploit as part of our project.The research has the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy, change cultures of service delivery amongst private and third sector organisations and, increase public engagement with research and societal issues.

Who will benefit?

1. Various government departments in the UK but also in at least five other states (potentially the US, Denmark, France, India and New Zealand). These departments will include those responsible for coordinating the promotion of behaviour change techniques within their respective governments, (e.g. the Cabinet Office in the UK and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the US) as well as other departments that have made use of these insights in constructing policy interventions (e.g. departments of the Environment, Energy, Finance, Health, Local Government).

2. Non-governmental organisations involved in seeking to promote - or resist - changes in behaviour. NGOs increasingly use insights from the psychological sciences to instigate a change in behaviour among individuals and groups (e.g. the role of Sustrans in seeking to re-design streets in ways that are more conducive to pedestrians and cyclists). NGOs are also involved in seeking to draw attention to the potential insidiousness of behaviour change interventions (e.g. the Church in Wales has sought to counter the Welsh Government's proposals of presumed consent for organ donation).

3. The general public is, obviously, being affected in far-reaching ways by this behaviour change agenda but, almost by definition, they could remain largely ignorant of this fact as choice architectures are manipulated in ways unbeknownst to them. The findings of this project will draw attention to behaviour change policies in public debate, primarily in the UK, but also potentially in the other five states that we will study.

How will they benefit?

1. Government departments will benefit from the research since they will develop:
a) more nuanced understanding of how their use of behaviour change insights relates to the use being made of these insights in other states;
b) more detailed comprehension of what kinds of behaviour change interventions work and the most appropriate ways of evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions;
c) awareness of alternative, more ethical, progressive, democratic and potentially effective ways of changing long-term behaviours and values.

2. NGOs will benefit from the research since they will develop:
a) a more detailed appreciation of the potential effectiveness of behaviour change initiatives as a means of addressing their key goals as organisations;
b) greater understanding of the mechanisms used by governments and others to change behaviours, thus arming them with the knowledge and expertise to challenge or amend them.

3. The general public will benefit from the research since they will develop:
a) greater awareness of the increasing role played by choice architectures in shaping the contexts within which they make a range of decisions about their personal welfare;
b) understanding of the alternative mechanisms that may help to change their behaviours, attitudes and underlying values in positive ways.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ogilvy Change</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mindfulness Training provided to employees of Ogilvy Change</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC6B7E45-7E9C-42B5-AE5F-01FE28C754F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pykett, J. et al.

The non-academic impacts of this project can be broken down in to three broad areas: impact on behaviour change policy making; affects on the working practices of organizations who have participated in our Mindfulness and Decision Making Programme; social debate and deliberation about the role of the behavioural sciences and mindfulness in public life.

Impact on behaviour change policy making:

Our research into the global spread and application of the behavioural sciences has lead to the research team being approached to provide guidance and support to organisations considering the deployment of behavioural insights within their own, or their client's, work. We thus provided advice to the European Commission Joint Research Centre in the process of the production of their
report 'Behavioural Insights Applied to Policy' (European Union, 2016). Our research team was also consulted by the German agency TNS Infratest Sozialforschung who were offering advice and guidance on the application of behavioural insights to employment policy by the German state. TNS Infratest Sozialforschung contacted us on the basis of our report 'Nudging All Over the World: Assessing the Global Impact of the Behavioural Sciences on Public Policy' (Whitehead et al, 2014), which they were using to gain an insight in to the varied nature of related policy developments. Throughout the consultative advice we have been providing, we consistently emphasise the importance of considering the ethics, efficacy, and empowering dimensions of behavioural policies, and suggest that they can offer much more than many of their contemporary policy manifestations suggest. These are insights that appear to be influencing the policy advice that the organisation we have liaised with are providing to the member states/groups they are working for. It will, however, require more time for us to effectively assess the impact of the advice we have offered. 

Affects on the working practices of organizations who have participated in our Mindfulness and Decision Making Programme:

We have worked with the Welsh Government, Global Action Plan (third sector), and Ogilvy Change (private sector) in the development and application of an 8-week mindfulness-based behaviour change training programme. This programme has now run on 6 separate occasions and trained over 100 participants working in these different organisations. On the basis of this work we have evidence for a series of impacts that our research is having on the working practices of these three organisations. These impacts can be summarised as:

1. A new appreciation among behaviour change practitioners in the public, private and third sectors of the role that mindfulness training can have on peoples' understanding of behavioural insights, and how it can be used to support the development of more empowering, ethical, and effective behavioural policy. On the basis of the evidence we have gathered the Welsh Government are currently exploring ways in which they can expand the provision of our Mindfulness and Decision-making Programme within the civil service. Our research has also lead to discussion between the Welsh and English branches of the civil service, which has resulted in Whitehall departments now exploring the potential roll-out of related training programmes. 

2. Our Mindfulness and Decision-Making Programme has had a direct impact on behaviour change practitioner's ability to notice and address behavioural biases in their own work and decision-making.

3. Our Mindfulness and Decision-Making Programme has had a direct impact on the working practices of behaviour change practitioners, with participants on the programme reporting that it has changed the ways in which they relate to colleagues and client groups/stakeholders, and made them more effective in the workplace.

4. Our Mindfulness and Decision-Making programme has had a direct impact on the wellbeing of behaviour change practitioners, with participants on the programme reporting increases in key aspects of their wellbeing both at work and at home. 

The full results of our Mindfulness and Decision-Making Research programme have been reported in our Mindfulness, Behaviour Change and Decision Making - An Experimental Trial report (Pykett et al, 2016). This report was recently presented at a Parliamentary event in Westminister. Our research has also been included in a Ministerial Briefing to the Welsh Government exploring the potential contribution of mindfulness to Welsh Society (November, 2015). 

Social debate and deliberation about the role of the behavioural sciences and mindfulness in public life:

On the basis of our research we have been interviewed by writers/journalists who are exploring the varied roles of both behaviour change and mindfulness within society. Our work has thus featured in articles exploring the ethical implications of behaviour change (see Berreby, 2014) and a recent Guardian article exploring the role of mindfulness training in the university sector (Swain, 2016). We also wrote a commissioned piece for the Guardian online exploring the application of behavioural insights to help prevent the use of mobile phones in cars. This particular piece received 450 comments and was one of the most shared pieces on the Guardian online site that day. On the bases of this work, and our own blog, we have had an impact on the levels of public debate and scrutiny associated with behaviour change policies and mindfulness. Our mindfulness research was recently featured as a case study in the Mindfulness Initiative's publication 'Building the Case for Mindfulness in the Workplace' (2016)</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>17168DFC-231E-45BD-9B01-597630DCB3F8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5693dfd1af7173.32722095</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has had been successful in securing four main achievements:

1. Establishing the global impact of the behavioural sciences on public policy. A central research objective of this project was to explore the extent to which the observed impact of the behavioural sciences on public policy in certain Western states was being felt throughout the world. Through our global scoping study 'Nudging All Over the World' we discovered that at least 135 states (69% of all independent states) demonstrated evidence that the behavioural sciences were having some impact on the design and delivery of public policy, and that 51 states had centrally orchestrated engagements between the behavioural sciences and public policy.

2. Identifying geographical variations and similarities in the use of the behavioural sciences in public policy. Through our 6 in-depth national case studies on the impacts of the behavioural sciences on public policy (Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK, and USA), we have revealed the different ways in which these sciences have been used in varied political and social context. While we observed very different forms of ethical debates emerging about how best to use the behavioural sciences to serve the public good, we generally found great similarities in the ways in which new behavioural insights were being employed in different states. 

3. Establishing cross-sectoral impacts of neuroliberalism. In completing over 50 in-depth interviews with policy markers and experts we have revealed that the emerging insights of the behavioural sciences are not only shaping public policy, but are having impacts on the private sector (particularly in relation to corporate social responsibility strategies) and the third sector. In this context, we have shown that neuroliberalism (the term we have developed to understand and critically analyze the emerging impacts of the behavioural sciences on public life) should be explored not only as a facet of state government, but as part of an emerging system of cross-sector behavioural governance.

4. Demonstrated the impacts that mindfulness training can have on how new behavioural insights are understood and used. Through the four behavioural trials we have run with policy-makers, we have demonstrated that learning about new behavioural insights through mindfulness training can have an impact on how those behavioural insights are interpreted and used. More specifically, our Mindfulness, Behaviour Change and Engagement in Public Policy programme revealed that: a. mindfulness training provides an effective practical context in and through which to learn about new behavioural insights; b. that mindfulness training can supported greater capacities for perceived forms of control over behaviour; and c. that mindfulness supports the desire to build systems of behaviour change that seek to more actively empower those who are subject to behavioural interventions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Non- Academic Impact:

Following our work with the Welsh Government's civil service and the third sector organisation Global Action plan, we are exploring the ways in which mindfulness-based behavioural insights can be used within both staff training programmes and policy development. To these ends, we are currently in the process of establishing more trials of our Mindfulness, Behaviour Change and Engagement in Public Policy programme with civil servants in the Welsh government (supported by ESRC Impact Accelerator funding) and are involved in a project funding bid with Global Action Plan that would enable us to explore in greater detail how mindfulness could be applied within behavioural policy developments. As part of our ongoing ESRC Impact Accelerator project, we also aim to work with Ogilvy Change to explore how our research can be applied in the private sector. 

Academic Impacts:

Following the symposium we convened in November 2014, Low Carbon Living and Art of Behaviour Change, we aim to build an interdisciplinary (and cross-sectoral) centre. The centre will be entitled the Centre for Critical Behavioural Studies and will seek to combine the insights of sociological and behavioural sciences in order to develop progressive and empowering forms of behaviour change. This centre will build on our own research to the extent that it recognizes the important, but often overlooked, sociological insights that can be used within emerging understanding of behavioural government, and the potential that exists to support behavioural learning and empowerment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>87AF5898-0B22-4323-BB26-5AF5856D4273</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5543dbbb4942e4.03495301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://changingbehaviours.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Provision of Mindfulness Based Behaviour Change Training to employees of Ogilvy Change</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2DA08AC-6355-46A3-ADD9-89ED3098AFEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our training programme has been associated with advances in participant's understanding of behavioural insights (which is key to their effectiveness in the workplace) and reported improvements in their day-today wellbeing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb19218a2556.20110716</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://changingbehaviours.wordpress.com/2016/02/10/mindfulness-and-decision-making/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Our research was used as a case study in the Mindfulness Initiative's publication 'Building the Case for Mindfulness in the Workplace' (2016)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ED7A2BB2-D73E-4165-996E-0DEADA7824FC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c57421cc0ab3.57455470</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://themindfulnessinitiative.org.uk/publications/building-the-case</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Mindfulness Based Behavioural Learning with Global Action Plan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>559809A2-F37D-4B0F-8EC0-12A0A0E6A95B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5548d21cb3dae5.41732224</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Provision of Mindfulness Based Behaviour Change Training to civil servants in Welsh Government</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9FFE9812-16DC-4381-BA40-622631206923</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research into the impacts of our eight week Mindfulness Based Behaviour Change programme revealed that it had a measurable impact on the ways in which the civil servants who participated delivered public services.
