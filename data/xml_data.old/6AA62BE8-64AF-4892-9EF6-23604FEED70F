This is particularly crucial when social traumas, genocides, ethnic cleansing, civil war and forced exile are involved, and constitute the core of on-going conflicts. 

On the one hand, it is usually the victim's point of view that permeates the historical accounts of such traumatic events. The underlying assumption in historical researches is that victims provide first-hand narratives of brutalization, violence, rape, torture and so on. However, as Primo Levi (1976) noticed, the survivor and the witness are not one and the same thing. The American historian Raoul Hilberg (1961), author of the magisterial Destruction of the European Jews, highly criticized a history based on victims or survivals narratives. He based his work on the perpetrators and executors' documents and testimonies. Hannah Arendt (1963) followed him by justifying her absolute need to attend the Eichmann trial writing 'I wanted to expose myself not to the actions themselves - which are after all already known - but to the one who did them' 
(H. Arnedt Letter to the New-Yorker's editor July 1961). The contribution of history to truth and memory remains incomplete without the acknowledgement of the perpetrators' vantage point. 

On the other hand, the importance of oral history is largely acknowledged among civil society activists and researchers; visual oral testimonies are more and more used in different fields such as history, sociology, anthropology and many others. But access to this material is highly difficult for a wide audience, including civil society activists.

In the work of the 'new Israeli historians', testimonies have been crucial in historical accounts of social traumas. Their contribution for peace activists from both Israel and Palestine is of great importance. A large number of documentary films, books, oral testimonies, stories, lectures, publications and research projects have been and are still being produced with the aim of telling the story of the expulsion and destruction of Palestinian society in 1948. Most of the work that has already been done is based on the urgent need to collect Palestinians' memories. However, there is still much to be acknowledged. In fact, the 'blind spot' and historiographical and political disputes relates to the absence, up to date, of any systematic archive of personal oral testimonies from Jewish Israeli 1948 war veterans. That kind of archive would record the extent to which Israeli soldiers and officials actively took part in military and civil operations designed to facilitate the Palestinian Exodus, and, moreover, guarantee its irreversibility.

Digital technologies change the way we produce knowledge and the way this knowledge can be implemented in social contexts. It involves new possibilities for social, human, ethical and political commitments in the domain of historical and artistic research. Our research project is an attempt to rethink these relationships in the light of truth and reconciliation processes. To be more specific, the case of what the Palestinian memory remembers as the 'Nakba', the forced exile of Palestinians perpetrated by Israeli soldiers in 1948, is a good point of departure to tackle these issues.
Our research project represents a close collaboration between historians and new media artists and researchers. It intends to provide a framework for both history and civil society of a joint archive of testimonies from victims and perpetrators and a Common archive. The interdisciplinary collaboration will imply a rethinking of documentary cinema and oral history in the age of Internet; it will collect 100 testimonies from 1948 Jewish Israeli war veterans and produce an audio-visual documentary available for free online as a case study and tangible outcome of the research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outside academia, individuals and organizations would benefit mainly from the audio-visual outcome of this research project. The archive will be an online platform, including edited testimonies of Jewish fighters with Arabic and English subtitles, transcriptions in 3 languages, synopses of transcriptions, and links to testimonies of refugees relating to the same events and same sites mentioned in the Jewish testimonies, translated into English and Hebrew. The audio-visual testimonies and their transcriptions would be available worldwide. The platform can be used for educational purposes and to raise social awareness. The funding of our initiative can indirectly increase the ability of civil society organizations and NGOs in Israel-Palestine to raise awareness on specific issues. The project intends both to legitimize Palestinian testimonies and to find a place for the Nakba in the Jews' collective memory in Israel. The availability of the media and the multiplicity of formats - text, sound, moving images - make sure that the uses of this document are really flexible. The videos can provide a basis for public projections and discussions about the Nakba. The transcriptions would also be priceless documents for future researches. It can also provide documents for happenings dedicated to the memory of the 1948 Nakba.

More generally, the whole framework for a common archive and the website for the Israeli veterans archive, and indeed later on a common archive, can be a first step towards a broader project: collecting testimonies from other victims and perpetrators in other geographies and social-political contexts (Argentina, Northern Ireland, Ex-Yugoslavia, etc...) .</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23971</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J013242/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
