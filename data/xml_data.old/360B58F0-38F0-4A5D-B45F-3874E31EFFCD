Meanwhile economic growth and significant infrastructure planning is taking place within C&amp;amp;SA in the absence of adequate climate information.

Deficient understanding of many key climate features in C&amp;amp;SA is one barrier to the integration of climate information into decision-making. UMFULA will provide a step-change in climate science in C&amp;amp;SA. Our objectives include: (i) fundamental research into key climate processes over C&amp;amp;SA and how these are dealt with in models; (ii) a process-based evaluation to determine how models invoke change and whether that change is credible; (iii) production of novel climate products (Work Packages WP1-2) encompassing convection permitting and very high resolution (c4 km) ocean-atmosphere coupled simulations that will reveal processes of high impact events and as yet unexplored complexities of the climate change signal. We will also focus on neglected but critical elements of the circulation such as the links between C&amp;amp;SA and the role of local features including the Angolan Low, Botswana anticyclone, Angola/Benguela Frontal Zone, and the Seychelles-Chagos thermocline ridge. Based on this research and through co-production with stakeholders we will generate improved and streamlined climate information for decision-makers (WP3).

We will use a deliberative and participatory methodology to test findings from FCFA pillars 1 and 2 with stakeholders based on deep engagement in two contrasting case studies: the Rufiji river basin in Tanzania, and sub-national decision-making in Malawi. They are carefully selected as exemplars of multi-sector, multi-stakeholder, and multi-scale decision situations which can be compared for transferable lessons on the effective use of climate services.

In-depth understanding of decision-making contexts, including political economy, theories of institutional change, and individual motivation from behavioural sciences will inform how to tailor and target climate projections for most effective use (WP4). The case study areas (WP5-6) will test these findings through a co-produced framework of C&amp;amp;SA-appropriate decision-making under climate uncertainty to identify robust climate services-informed intervention pathways (portfolios of policies and investments that could work well over a broad range of climatic and socio-economic futures). Our Capstone Work Package (WP7), and major outcome, will be the synthesis of best decision-making models and appraisal methods that are transferable in the African context and enable effective use of climate information in medium-term decision-making.

The seven UMFULA Work Packages cut across the three FCFA pillars to ensure maximum complementarity and integration. We are a consortium with world-leading expertise in climate science, decision science and adaptation research and practice, together with stakeholder networks and strong, long-standing relationships in C&amp;amp;SA. We comprise 5 UK and 13 African institutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from our research? Case study participants: Rufiji river basin: the government River Basin Water Office and the public-private partnership Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania; southern Malawi: Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation and Water Resources, Chikwawa, Nsanje and Thoyolo District Assemblies. Case study outputs will benefit multilateral development banks and the southern African Climate Resilient Infrastructure Facility-CRIDF, who advise on infrastructural development. National and regional decision-makers in C&amp;amp;SA and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) including Southern African Development Community, WATERNET, CRIDF. Programmes concerned with climate services, e.g. Global Framework for Climate Services, CCAFS, IRI, CLIVAR, ESPA, CARIAA ASSAR. Met Services in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania. Universities of Zambia and Yaounde. African citizens vulnerable to climate related risks, or reliant on infrastructure/resources that may be affected by climate change (now-40 years on).
How might they benefit from our research? Through deep engagement, national and local government and private sector stakeholders in both Malawi and Tanzania will be enabled to drive a process of improved use of climate services in decision-making processes. This is critical in both case study contexts which have been selected based on the climate risk to water and agriculture infrastructure and the implications it has for economic development. The process will be supported by the Met Services whose capacity will be built to produce country-specific contextualized projections based on the outputs of climate models given their responsibility in country to do so. Active engagement of Met Services within the case study co-production will also build partnerships that extend beyond the project lifetime and can inform on-going country policy processes: for example the development of the National Adaptation Plans. The ultimate aim is that improved use of climate services in decision-making benefits African citizens, not only in Malawi and Tanzania but also further afield, through the proactive communication of robust theoretical and applied findings to decision-makers across C&amp;amp;SA and further disseminated for use throughout SSA. By engaging with major initiatives such as GFCS (which is piloting programmes in both case study countries) we will have outreach and potential impact well beyond the two case studies. Univ Zambia &amp;amp; Yaounde and African Met Services will participate in a 'big science' project involving state-of-the-art high resolution models. 
As a team we have a strong track record of applied research and proven impact in climate science and adaptation across Africa. Our approach includes
Co-production of knowledge and stakeholder-driven deliberative processes as the key methodology in the case studies; in which case study participants are engaged throughout the process and have co-ownership of the process and, by definition, the findings will be targeted to be of direct applicability and achieve maximum development impact. 
Embedding impact in our management structures to maximize impact over the lifetime of the project and ensure post-project sustainability 
1) Impact sub-group led by KULIMA 
2) Advisory Panel, high level strategic guidance, through bi-annual TCs with representation from key regional organisations, public and private sector, donors and multi-laterals (eg agreed participation of World Bank staff)
A proactive approach to collaboration with other RPCs and the CCKE, eg invitation to sit on panels to maximise synergistic findings and outreach opportunities
Seizing opportunities for development of African capacity through providing bursaries to students in C&amp;amp;SA countries, making it a policy for senior team members and PDRAs to give guest lectures/research training sessions during C&amp;amp;SA visits (at university and other organisations eg Government) and offer some remote research co-supervision.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41470</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>LSE Cities</gtr:department><gtr:description>LUANAR and Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services Department</gtr:description><gtr:id>3EBAE36A-8344-4DCC-9CAE-01862E0F285E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Draft country information brief

This follows the additional funding secured by UMFULA team for a mini project- Communicating climate futures to end users in Malawi and Tanzania.
 The project aims to consolidate relations with in-country partners, including National Meteorological Agencies and government departments, to improve availability and capacity to use climate information. Tailored outputs (Briefs) for Malawi and Tanzania will be produced to improve understanding of how climate change could evolve and explain the potential use and limitations of this information. 
The main process was through presentations and answering key questions provided by the project leadership. During the meeting the Malawi team explained the proposed work of co-producing the country brief and the content and format of the brief. The team leader further clarified the approaches to be taken to produce the brief. DCCMS was then asked to present on what it does so as to see where the project could assist to improve its delivery or see the synergies between the approaches and content. DCCMS presented a lot of materials that are very relevant to the project. DCCMS indicated that they always do scenario development, which could be very relevant to the project. In addition, the DCCMS team presented their work and services that are currently available including some of the challenges faced by the department. Finally, the meeting identified areas that need to be addressed by the parties and the best approaches to achieve the proposed interventions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca67dd62c038.54150107</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.luanar.bunda.mw</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Communicating climate futures to end users in Malawi and Tanzania</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9C834E94-DECC-4B4D-BDD4-CF6380E938AB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58e73dcea2cf96.84802839</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in the National Climate Change Technical Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BF71CE54-24F7-4CC4-98AA-20F7D3500758</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development challenge in Malawi is that there are so many players working in the field of climate change. Through UMFULA I presented a paper to the National Technical Committee on Climate change the need to regulate the process of engaging Non Governmental Organisations at District level. In the presented I suggested the need for the Government In charge at district level to organise and conduct climate change related interventions. This has been accepted by the government and currently, most of the meetings and interventions dealing with climate change at district level are being chaired by the District Executive Officer. In addition, I have proposed the need to create a Think Tank that will build the capacity of stakeholders at National level. This idea has been supported by UNDP and there is a chance of creating such a group.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58e73fc42312c9.61825252</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M020509/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>360B58F0-38F0-4A5D-B45F-3874E31EFFCD</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/M020509/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>41470.42</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>9F43857C-C198-43F8-BFA1-E97E73C7D349</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/M020509/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>36973.94</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>78369800-A95E-49BC-94E7-8659E5C2EFEF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geography and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B945AA77-44D5-467F-9B53-2EE3C3F550B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Land - Ocean Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8DA0F0DB-E15C-4A3D-ADD9-E08898CE6475</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Regional Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
