Among one of its most striking predictions is the existence of black holes. The latter are regions of the spacetime from which nothing, even light, can escape. In four spacetime dimensions, the properties of equilibrium black holes are well-understood: they are uniquely specified by their mass and spin, they are spherically shaped, and they are dynamically stable. This last property is very important since it makes them astrophysically relevant as the endpoint of the gravitational collapse of a star. Indeed, according to our current understanding, after a sufficiently massive star has exhausted its nuclear fuel, it has no other option but to collapse and form a black hole. However, black holes contain in their interior singularities where the gravitational force becomes so extreme that general relativity breaks down. It is expected that in these situations a new theory that combines the laws of quantum mechanics with general relativity, namely a theory of quantum gravity, is required.In recent years the study of general relativity in dimensions greater than four has received a lot of attention for various reasons. First, general relativity is contained in string theory and the latter is our best candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. However, its consistency requires more than four spacetime dimensions. Second, according to recent developments, string theory (and hence gravity) in certain spacetimes is equivalent to an ordinary theory of particles, without gravity, in one spacetime dimension less. Typically, in the regime in which string theory reduces to general relativity the corresponding particle physics theory cannot be described by the standard methods in particle physics. Therefore, five-dimensional gravity, and in particular black holes, provide a novel tool to address problems in standard four-dimensional theories of particles. This new tool has proven to be very useful in a variety of contexts. For example, it has been possible to understand some properties of the quark-gluon plasma that is being produced in accelerators (e.g., the LHC). Finally, some theories predict the production of higher dimensional black holes at the LHC. The main goal of my research is to get a better understanding of higher dimensional black holes. To achieve this I propose to: study the dynamical stability of black holes, find new higher dimensional black holes and study the formation of black holes. One novel property that higher dimensional black holes have is that they can become unstable if they spin sufficiently fast. In four dimensions this cannot happen since the spin of a black hole always has an upper bound. However, the details of these instabilities are not fully understood. In my research I will study these instabilities both analytically and numerically. These instabilities typically signal the existence of new black holes. Hence, their study should give us clues about the kinds of black holes that there are and how they are related. Secondly, the general properties of higher dimensional black holes are not fully understood. In particular, it is not even known what kinds of black holes there can be. For instance, doughnut-shaped black holes have been discovered in five dimensions and they explicitly demonstrate that parameters other than the mass and the spin are needed to fully specify the black hole. In my project I will develop methods to systematically find new black holes analytically.Finally, I will use five-dimensional gravity to study the equilibration of the corresponding particle theory. This process cannot be studied analytically by standard methods, but from the gravity side it corresponds to the formation of a black hole. In addition, my results may have implications for the issue of singularity formation in general relativity, which is an interesting mathematical problem in its own right.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My proposed research not only will answer fundamental questions about higher dimensional black holes but also it will open new directions for future research. Moreover, I plan to develop new techniques with wider applications and in this respect, the beneficiaries of my research will not be restricted to scientists working in general relativity and string theory. My work will be of great benefit for the scientists in my host institution since the research I have proposed is directly related to their own interests. In addition, PhD students in DAMTP will also be direct beneficiaries of my work. I have already collaborated with some of them in the past and I will continue to do so in the future. In addition, I will offer them informal supervision and guidance. In the course of the project that I have proposed, I will develop new analytical and numerical methods that will be useful in wider contexts other than just the one strictly encompassed by my own field of research. Therefore, the whole scientific community will benefit from these new tools. For instance, particle physicists may indirectly benefit from my research since some of the problems that I will address from a theoretical point of view may have observational consequences. In particular, my methods may be useful for understanding the data produced at the LHC. Similarly, my results may be relevant for condensed matter physicists. The reason is that the gauge/gravity correspondence has been recently applied to the study of superconductors. The tools that I plan to develop in my proposed research will also be applicable to these situations and therefore they may lead to a better theoretical understanding of superconductors. In the long term this may have an important economic impact. Indeed, superconductors are widely used in our modern society, and a better theoretical understanding of them may lead to new technological applications. Therefore, the commercial private sector and the general public will be potential long term beneficiaries as well. Exploring the predictions of our theories, as I will do in my proposed research, may have unforeseen benefits for the whole society in the long term. For instance, in order to test these predictions, new experiments will have to be devised and therefore, new cutting-edge technologies will have be developed to carry them out. These new technologies then return to the society in the form of new applications that may foster the nation's economic performance, quality of life, wealth and culture. The general public is certainly interested in string theory, higher dimensions, black holes, etc., as popular science books explicitly demonstrate. My proposed research addresses these topics and is aimed to improve our understanding of them. Therefore, the general public will benefit from the progress made in this direction. Also, one of the main motivations for string theory is to develop a quantum theory of gravity. Having such a theory is absolutely necessary in order to understand the Big Bang. Of course, understanding the origin of the Universe would be a major contribution to human culture. The results that I produce will be made available to the whole scientific community by publishing articles in scientific journals and giving talks in conferences and/or invited seminars. Also, I will post my papers on the web-based archive (arxiv.org), which is freely accessible to the general public. In addition, I will explain the results of my work to the general public. This will be done by collaborating with general science journals (e.g., New Scientist), advertising my results in the DAMTP website or through the University of Cambridge press office, and taking part in various activities such as the Millenium Mathematics Project. The latter is an education initiative based at the University of Cambridge, and whose aim is to promote and explain mathematics to the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Thanks to the research done during the duration of this grant, I obtained a better understanding of black holes in higher dimensions and in anti-de Sitter spaces.
