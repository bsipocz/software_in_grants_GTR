water related NERC grants and studentships at water@leeds with businesses and policy makers directly involved with
delivering the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). The fellowship aims to maximise impact in delivering the
WFD by translating the relevant science for business and policy makers, which is essential for them to prepare for the
future. There is a significant opportunity to gain advantage from existing research available by looking at it with new
eyes from a WFD perspective. Whilst many existing NERC water projects have not directly focussed upon WFD,
when scrutinised and put into business terms they will provide a wealth knowledge to help users and practitioners
prepare for delivery of the directives' requirements. Without this fellowship, the potential use of current academic
knowledge will not be realised and costs of implementing WFD will be higher.
By interpreting and sharing the existing water@leeds science-base that is of use to WFD policy and practice and
developing relationships between businesses and policy makers, value and efficiencies will be realised through
applying knowledge to practical implementation. This means using science knowledge for developing strategies,
informing policy decisions and improving understanding of environmental effects in relation to compliance with the
WFD.
Through building targeted partnerships with business, policy and water@leeds the fellowship will help foster a new
focus of collaborative and impact-focussed research activity with stakeholders, which is likely to generate long lasting
future partnerships with business.
The fellow has significant experience of working with WFD, and has undergone extensive engagement with senior
practitioners to agree priority areas of work for the fellowship with key organisations (Environment Agency,
Yorkshire Water, Natural England). This project delivers to NERC?s KE priority on water security and in particular
on the integrated catchment management strand. To do this the project focuses on improving the UK?s ability to
implement and adhere to the WFD.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Environment Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Host the Upland Hydrology Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>482F1DF1-2172-45B0-9966-4C93B6BFE66D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>November 2013 - UHG core meeting
On November 12th 2013 water@leeds hosted a core meeting of the UHG which was well attended and received very positive feedback. Aims of the meeting were to provide member updates of current issues, progress on key issues and set the UHG agenda for the future.
March 2014 - National conference with BHS
On March 10th 2014 the Upland Hydrology Group with water@leeds and the BHS hosted an event 'Upland Hydrology in the UK'. This was extremely successful and received very positive feedback. Over 120 delegates attended. Of these the majority expressed that they wanted to be kept in touch with UHG activities and found the event very useful.

July 2014 - core members field meeting
This meeting is currently being planned to discuss issues and gain practical knowledge. It is likely to be held in the South Pennines.

Purpose acheived:

? To showcase research, expertise and tools available for use by practitioners and policy 
? To share practical examples of what works and how
? To discuss best way to share information, raise awareness of priority issues

This event will provide a wealth of information related to urban water management - covering diffuse pollution issues, surface water / flooding issues and the practicalities of delivering solutions.

The event builds on preliminary discussions from an Expert Forum held last year where key issues related to urban management were discussed This will also link organisations and individuals to share the latest information and best practice available and follows the Environment Agency's National Urban Run Off meeting in February.

Key themes for discussion are:-
1. What are the most important urban pollution and run off issues - what are the main sources and pathways and how can they be reduced? 
2. What barriers (legislative, cost, attitude, other) are there to improving urban catchment management for multiple benefits?
3. What are the best ways to share information and contacts. Would a web based platform to help be useful and what would it need to include?
4. Who's responsible for reducing diffuse pollution and who can pay? Policy needs.
5. Are there significant gaps in our understanding? What monitoring and research requirements would benefit our understanding.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5459033cc3d6c9.26759872</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organised and held an education event with the DEFRA pathfinder project and SOURCE</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>634AE5F8-E028-4CE9-BA89-566318E6CEFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organised an event to highlight research and it's application in the uplands.

The acheived purpose was to focus on solutions
- Collate and share knowledge and skills between practitioners from industry, business, academia and policy to increase compliance with the WFD
- Establish what initiatives and research is available (either complete or ongoing) to inform implementation of the WFD

Key themes for discussion were
?Agriculture and rural land management
?Urban planning and diffuse pollution
?Hydromorphology - achieving good ecological potential


The acheived aims of this event were to
- address barriers and identify options for meeting WFD objectives in peat uplands
- share examples of practical examples and ideas particularly amongst water companies
- assess the economics of WFD implementation in peat uplands, including how Payments for Ecosystem Services might help reduce the cost of WFD implementation
- identify the best ways to continue sharing knowledge on these issues</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458fead6fbfe5.31569497</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>For this fellowship, detailed reports are submitted regularly to report impact and outcomes.
