Increased atmospheric CO2 is leading to an increase in sea surface temperature (0.6C in the past 100 years) and is causing an expansion and dilution of the oceans due to increased rainfall and input of melt water from terrestrial glaciers and ice sheets. In addition, the ocean has absorbed about one third of the CO2 produced by humans since pre-industrial times. The resulting reductions in ocean pH, otherwise known as Ocean Acidification (OA) and carbonate concentrations are causing some alarm, as many marine invertebrates such as corals, echinoderms and molluscs depend on seawater carbonate sources to calcify their external shells and skeletons. Moreover, these groups are largely intolerant of environmental stress and are limited in their abilities to adjust to change. As a result they are considered to be the most sensitive to the climate-related changes expected in the oceans. Currently there is a real concern that many of these species will experience population declines and may even become extinct. This would lead to irreversible changes in the ecology of marine ecosystems by influencing community interactions and community structure. 

More recently, however, it has become apparent that taxa and species normally expected to be more tolerant of the projected changes may also be under threat. This realisation has come about because of recent examination of longer term responses to OA (weeks to months) in response to multiple variables i.e. usually OA plus temperature. It is now appears that organisms that are able to compensate physiologically and buffer the changes caused by environmental disruption, may be indirectly impacted by these environmental changes because such adjustments are ultimately energetically expensive. Currently, it is unknown what will happen to these organisms over time because the energy required for compensation could be diverted away from other vital processes such as immune function and growth, leading to increased susceptibilities to disease and a reduction in growth rates. The present project aims to establish links between compensatory capacities, energy use and performance in 2 species of brachyuran crabs with differing abilities to compensate for change. First year juvenile crabs from an ecologically important and highly invasive species outside of Europe, Carcinus maenas, and a commercially important species, Cancer pagurus, will be exposed to elevated pCO2 (0.08 kPa - levels predicted by 2100) and reduced salinity (~80%) for up to 18 months. The key physiological questions are whether the 2 species will be able to adjust their physiology to continue to function optimally, and whether these adjustments are metabolically costly and can be maintained over time. The key ecological questions will be whether these costly changes compromise individual fitness and performance with the potential to compromise population size. A project studentship will run in parallel to the main project and allow us to investigate the effects of high pCO2 and low salinity on the more vulnerable larval stages of three species of brachyuran crabs, C. maenas, C. pagurus and Necora puber. The studentship will investigate changes in larval development and performance which could impact larval recruitment, and will therefore identify potential population bottlenecks. 

This proposal represents the results of an on-going collaboration between researchers at Bangor and Southampton. These research teams are involved in a number of national and international OA research projects, but have identified that our limited understanding of the interaction of pCO2 and salinity, plus the lack of information on the responses of marine crustaceans to OA, is a weakness of existing research effort.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the outcome of the research will inform on the vulnerability of an ecologically important species of marine crab Carcinus maenas, and a commercially important species Cancer pagurus, the work could potentially impact on a range of end-user communities. Several potential users of the research have been identified and are detailed below. They include beneficiaries/stakeholders with a keen interest in the consequences and impacts of climate change on the natural environment and on marine species in particular. 
Industry: End-user communities include the shellfish industry, commercial aquaculture concerns, and their trade associations. Specific end-users on a local scale include the Southern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (IFCA) and on the national level, New Under Ten Fishermens Association (NUTFA), The Shellfish Association of Great Britain and Seafish Industry Authority. All four associations support the sustainable development of the shellfish industry, and have a keen interest in the impact of climate change on shellfish stocks. Seafish, for example, supports the shellfish industry for a sustainable, profitable future. Shellfish (crustaceans and bivalves) landings currently account for 50% of total fish landings in the UK, and the edible crab Cancer pagurus is particularly important to the shellfish industry in Wales. For instance, edible crab landings in Wales of just over 500 tonnes were worth &amp;pound;1 million in 2006. The outputs from the intended research would aid towards management plans as they would inform on the survival prospects of Cancer pagurus under future changes in OA and salinity.

Government: Key government beneficiaries include Local Authorities, The Welsh Assembly Government, Welsh Assembly Government/ Fisheries, DEFRA, DECC and the Environment Agency. The research has the potential to influence and inform policy in the establishment of minimum standards for environmental protection and on common fisheries policy. More specifically,the work will be of relevance to shoreline management plans which are currently being developed by EA and local authorities by informing on species and habitats that may be vulnerable. This will lead to a better understanding on how coastal processes can be managed. More generally, the work will be used to increase our understanding and awareness of climate change issues, one of the key strategies for The Welsh Assembly Government, and feed into policy guidelines for future fisheries management.
Conservation agencies: Beneficiaries include Countryside Council for Wales, Nature England and Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The work will lead to effective implementation measures by informing on how survival prospects of the 2 crab species are affected by climate change.
Charities: The work will be of interest to local and national charities by informing on the survival prospects of two marine crab species. Local charities in Wales include those actively involved in marine conservation and the promotion of public awareness relating to UK wildlife and its natural environment. These include: North Wales Wildlife Trust, Marine Awareness North Wales, Dorset Wildlife Trust and Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust. 
Education sector and general public: Climate change is a contemporary problem. It is very topical and therefore of wide general interest, even though recent statistics gathered by Welsh Assembly shows that less people in Wales believed in climate change in 2009 than in 2008. The outputs from the intended research can be used as a basis to raise awareness and increase understanding of the issues surrounding climate change to engage school-age children, students, and members of clubs and societies with an interest in environmental issues, as well as the wider public.

We also determined whether any observed increases in metabolic costs compromised individual fitness and performance by affecting other energy demanding processes, leading to changes in immune function and changes in growth and survival rates. 
Studies focused on the intertidal/ estuarine crab, Carcinus maenas (shore crab) and the subtidal edible crab, Cancer pagurus. C. maenas is remarkably tolerant of a range of environments, has a wide geographical distribution and is highly invasive outside of Europe. C. pagurus is a shallow water species inhabiting European rocky shores from tidal levels (juveniles) down to 50-100m (adults) and is commercially important in the UK. This species is relatively intolerant of environmental change. 
The survival and performance of the two species was examined on exposure to elevated pCO2 (0.08 kPa) and reduced salinity (25 psu), either alone or in combination, over a period of 9 to 12 months. This was shorter than the intended 18 months for each species due to time restrictions, and in the case of the edible crab, increasing mortality rates after 6 months exposure. Sampling also occurred at one, 3 and 6 months.

Animal husbandry and maintenance of the high CO2/low salinity system: Considerable time and effort was taken to maintain the experimental conditions for extended periods. Water samples were removed very 2 weeks for the determination of carbon chemistry and nutrients. The crabs were fed individually 3 times a week. At the start of the exposures, 550 to 600 crabs were housed within individual containers within the aquarium system. 

Objective 1: Examine the effects on individual metabolic status and energy budgets;
To achieve this objective, we determined whole animal metabolic rates and cellular energy status across treatments and time intervals. We also examined nutritional status via elemental analysis. Reduced salinity had a different effect on metabolic rates, depending on species. In the shore crab, metabolic rates were generally higher in crabs exposed to reduced salinity, but in the edible crabs, metabolic rates were unchanged. In both species, elevated CO2 had no effect on metabolic rate. Despite long term exposure to treatments, elevated CO2 had no effect on dry mass or the percentage of carbon and nitrogen in the shore crab, and energy reserves remained unchanged. Effects on the edible crab are yet to be analysed. Ammonia excretion levels have also been determined for both species and will be related to rates of protein synthesis and growth. 

Objective 2: Characterise the physiological changes in compensatory capacities and examine their underlying mechanisms;
The shore crab was able to compensate its acid-base physiology despite changes in salinity and seawater CO2 levels, and was able to increase sodium pump activity in the gills. They later maintained haemolymph osmolality higher than that of the sea water in crabs exposed to dilute seawater. In sharp contrast, compensation for haemolymph acid-base disturbances in the edible crab remained unaffected over the first 3 months, but problems were encountered after 6 months. The edible crab was unable to increase sodium pump activity in its gills and haemolymph osmolality was maintained just above the level of the seawater. Survival rates were lower in the edible crab compared with the shore crab, but moulting continued in both species. 

Objective 3: Assess the fitness consequences via changes in immune performance and growth.
Throughout the experiments, morphometric measurements were taken on each individual over time. The number of moults was recorded as well as changes in fresh body mass. The early indication is that reduced salinity and elevated CO2 had no effect on the moulting frequency of the shore crab. Analysis of the data for the edible crab continues. Whole animal fractional rates of protein synthesis have also been determined for both species and the data is currently being analysed. 
Immune performance (numbers of circulating blood cells) in the shore crab was influenced by exposure salinity, but not pCO2. In the edible crab immune performance (numbers of circulating blood cells) was not affected by pCO2 exposure but was affected by changes in environmental salinity. In the edible crab there was also an effect of 'experiment time' (i.e. how long the crabs were held in captivity) on the circulating blood cell population. Effects of the activity of the key immune enzyme phenoloxidase were also determined, but no significant long term impacts of either salinity or pCO2 were detected.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project are still be collated for academic publication.
