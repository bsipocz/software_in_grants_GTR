Seeing or hearing of what they do, and what they buy, influences many of the decisions we make, and our social networks even affect how likely we are to contract and spread diseases. While social interactions like this might sound unique to humans and our modern lifestyle, social networks and learning by observing others also occurs in non-human animals, including insects, fish, reptiles and birds. For example, honeybees learn where it's best to forage by paying attention to the waggle dance displays given by other foragers, while canaries learn how to eat novel foods by watching females first. While some animals learn from others by direct teaching, many gain information by eavesdropping on others' interactions. 

But social groups do not interact in isolation from the rest of their environment; decisions made by one individual, population, or species can have very important implications for others. For example, some butterflies avoid being eaten by birds by evolving toxins and/or becoming distasteful. They signal this to their predators by coming in bright colours that make them stand out from their environment. But how does this evolve? If a butterfly must be eaten for the predator to learn, how does the new form of butterfly survive to reproduce and spread its colourful adaptation? Perhaps like waiting to watch a friend try a hot curry first, the butterflies survive because predators learn quickly by watching their neighbours - less butterflies need to be tasted or eaten for the predators' aversion to spread. If animals with more social interactions are able to gather more information about their world, social networks may be far more important to the wider ecological community than previously realised. 

What will happen in the future? The world is changing quickly, altering population sizes and their habitats. We do not know how environmental change will affect social networks and interactions, nor do we understand the importance of social information for many species who are already rapidly declining. I will In this fellowship I will investigate how social connections in one species vary and affect changes in others, as well as address its ramifications for the evolution and maintenance of biological diversity. First, I will combine established experimental methods for studying predator-prey interactions with those for studying social interactions. In aviary-based experiments with great tits as model predators I will ask (i) what information they gain about prey defences by watching others before (ii) testing how social information influences the speed of a predator's learning and then (iii) investigate how social learning by predators affects the success of prey that cheat by mimicking other prey species' defences. Next I will take advantage of technological advances in remote animal tracking to study the implications of social learning for the conservation of an endangered bird in New Zealand, the hihi. I will first (i) track how an aversion to an experimental warning symbol spreads through the adult population before (ii) asking if social groups of juveniles facilitate learning about food resources. Finally, (iii) I will determine how changing population densities affect social networks, and how social interactions change when hihi are moved to a new environment.

As we learn more about how animals interact and adapt to their environment, we are realising just how similar they are to us. Studying social interactions in other animals will therefore further our appreciation of how intricately entangled our own relationships are with the environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

1. My research will benefit academics working in all fields where the role of information in interactions and adaptive decisions is fundamental. This includes the broader fields of biomedical science, pest control, and the social sciences.

2. Conservation scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers will benefit because of the link between my behavioural ecology oriented questions and effective population size.

3. Because my research uses two charismatic species as model systems and concepts that are easily accessible and relevant to the social lives of the public, it will be very attractive to the media and science educators and inspire young people in to science-related careers.

How will they benefit from this research?

1. The relationship between networks of social interactions and the spread of information is analogous to disease transmission. Controlling the spread of diseases is one of the main challenges we face, affecting not only our health but also our economy (e.g. bovine tb). Furthermore, understanding the processes of selection responsible for the evolution of novel pathogens and alternative pest disguises is our best hope for developing new and more effective means of controlling, for example, antibiotic resistance. By using birds as model predators and artificial prey my research will allow controlled experiments that are focussed on the same underlying principles. 

2. Interactions among species underpin biological diversity and my research will shed light on the role of social interactions in particular. Conservation practice has traditionally focussed on single species, removing alien predators and/or initiating new populations through translocation. However, there has been little science underpinning what determines the minimum population size required to establish these new populations. Often populations fail without knowledge why. My research will demonstrate the importance of social interactions and associations for the spread of innovation, thus illustrating the cryptic variation necessary. Furthermore, by accentuating the approach of considering community interactions between predators and prey, my research will emphasise the newer ecosystem-based approaches to conservation. Gaining a greater understanding of the ways species adjust to environmental change is becoming more and more crucial, and it is paramount that basic science like that described here is conducted to ensure healthy ecosystems and the services they provide our wildlife and society. 

3. Science is a major driver of innovation in our economy, and the most important challenge it faces is inspiring young people to choose science as a career. Being a young female scientist conducting exciting fieldwork on the other side of the world, I will help dispel the image that scientists are male and spend all of their time in the lab. As my research is concerned with social interactions, it will generate easily accessible and vivid examples of how similar human society is to how the natural world operates. Therefore, these examples will make it easy to engage with the public and inspire with my enthusiasm (see Pathways to Impact).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>476646</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Zoological Society of London (ZSL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>John Ewen</gtr:description><gtr:id>311502C1-9F76-41F2-967E-719560DF7113</gtr:id><gtr:impact>outcomes from current grant in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542153d6ae4b28.11526445-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Facilitating research at field site and with stakeholders</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Proposed project and experimental design.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Zoology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Neeltje Boogert - Stress and social learning in wild birds</gtr:description><gtr:id>27289AA4-5CD9-457E-BDF0-10231B1856A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>data collection in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb13f8526562.83030947-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Boogert helped plan experiments and data collection.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Dr Boogert and I planned experiments with my PhD student; data collection is in progress under my supervision.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Zoology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Hannah Rowland - social networks in the wild &amp;amp; information use in captivity</gtr:description><gtr:id>7B49A319-E3D3-4F6B-8107-3C61B47D7B86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data collection in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb151bd5c057.08046694-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Rowland has established a study population of passerines near Cambridge which we are using for this study.

Our event was very successful in 2015 and we have been invited to take part again in this year's festival (March 5 and 12).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb212a8f7e77.52375392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://scicafecambridge.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>CHF</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Switzerland</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>it_CH</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Society in Science - Branco Weiss Fellowship</gtr:department><gtr:description>Society in Science - Branco Weiss</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>ETH Zurich</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>18E8D786-351F-40F1-9E49-5BE95AE159F6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5421545d18ec75.60892273</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings have been used to educate the public during outreach events conceived by myself, and to school children during event organised by the University.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DEFE6EC6-663C-41D6-BA32-CA9B66B472A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447cab38bd949.53831837</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>During first year of award I have initiated two new experimental methods. One involved developing a new method to manipulate social information for great tits using video screens, the other involved acquiring permission and attaching new radio frequency identification tags to hihi, a bird in New Zealand.

During the second year of this award my group is investigating why and how individuals vary in the ways they use information to assess risk. I have discovered that reed warblers, a species that plays host to cuckoo eggs, can assess threat levels of cuckoo-parasitism by paying attention to the activity of their neighbours. However they only act on this information if they also have personal experience of cuckoos at their nest. This is important as it means cuckoos must be secretive - not only do they risk alerting their target hosts, but they also risk information spreading rapidly through the local neighbourhood of potential hosts. Nine months of the second year of this award was taken as maternity leave.

During the third year of this award we have continued to trial application of RFID tags to produce data for evolutionary research and conservation. We discovered that the industry-standard tags do not function as well as advertised (recording 60% of events and suffering 10% complete failure) and have alerted other groups using this technology. We are therefore engaged in developing new tags and readers that are more fit for purpose in rugged field conditions. These are being developed by a technology specialist at the New Zealand Department of Conservation and will be deployed in 2017. Meanwhile, my group investigated the broader applicability of our findings from year 1 - do predator communities use information in similar ways? We performed pilot experiments with blue tits that suggest that they are reluctant to use social information about prey signals, but information use influences the speed of decision making. This is important because it highlights that not all species use information in equal ways, reaffirming the importance of considering ecological communities and not just single-species studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Work this year laid the groundwork for experiments to be conducted next year.
