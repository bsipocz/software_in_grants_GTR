Across many areas of contemporary culture we hear the concept of holism being invoked, as in holistic science, holistic spirituality, holistic healthcare, and holistic education. While there are different varieties of holism, each case implies a perspective in which the whole of a system is considered to be more important than the sum of its parts.

This project will provide an in-depth explanation and comparison of concepts of wholeness in the work of two influential twentieth-century thinkers in this area: the Swiss depth psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) and the French post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze (1923-1993). The research will have a particular focus on the field of psychotherapy, in the context of ongoing professional, academic, and policy debates about the effectiveness, and consequent funding, of psychotherapy in which non-holistic, more reductive therapeutic models seems to be favoured because of their greater amenability to quantitative evaluation through random controlled trials, specifically in relation to the NHS programme 'Improving Access to Psychological Therapies'.

Advocates of holism associate it with desirable qualities such as inclusion, integration, balance, and wider vision and champion it as a remedy for the fragmentation that is considered to beset the modern world. Critics argue that holism is vague, erases differences, and, by subordinating individual elements to a superior whole, ultimately leads to totalitarianism. This project will examine why holism attracts these strong positive and negative valuations and which point of view, if either, is the better warranted.

Further, holism is usually discussed in relation to a particular system which itself can be considered to be part of a wider whole and ultimately of the widest whole: the total 'system' which is referred to by some holists as the 'one world'. The project will examine the nature of such underpinning concepts of ultimate wholeness, how these concepts relate to the multiplicities of experience, and the links between a particular concept of ultimate wholeness and the positive or negative ethical valuations attaching to holistic thought.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal non-academic beneficiaries of the research will be psychotherapists. Engagement activities will also target environmentalists, educationalists, political activists, and religious practitioners, wherever these groups hold, or have to engage with, the view that the systems with which they work are wholes and/or are parts within larger wholes. But the project team will primarily attend to impact on the field of psychotherapy. For example, depending on the findings of the project, psychotherapists could be given an impetus to pay either greater or lesser attention to the 'whole person' and to the person's 'total context' in determining treatment. This is particularly relevant in the context of ongoing professional, academic, and policy debates about the effectiveness and consequent funding of psychotherapy, in which non-holistic therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are arguably privileged over longer-term therapies which, even when not specifically identified as holistic, are generally better able to attend to patients as whole persons. Better understanding of the concepts of the whole that can underpin holism, and of the ethical implications of the concepts, will enrich debates about efficacy and funding by providing an overall more nuanced understanding of holistic approaches to therapy and what is at stake in accepting or rejecting them. Such enhanced understanding is in turn likely to lead to improvements in therapy and consequently also in patient outcomes. These and related issues will be explored in a symposium on holism in psychotherapy, which will be organised by the Co-Investigator specifically for psychotherapists. 

More broadly, the project could have impact within any area of social or cultural activity in which holistic perspectives figure, inasmuch as the project will generate greater understanding of, and prompt greater reflection on, the implications of such perspectives, including ethical implications. In view of the social and cultural prevalence of holistic perspectives and the strong positive and negative valuations they receive, it is important that judgements about the weight that should be given to such perspectives in any area be based on well-informed consideration.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>219829</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Convergent evolution conference (Rome)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A3E2464-0086-49B9-8445-5205CE604C91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper presented to an audience of holistic practitioners and non-specialists in depth psychology, psychotherapy and complexity theorists entitled 'Beyond mechanism and finalism: alternative conceptions of temporality in Bergson, Jung and Deleuze' was given by project researcher Dr Christian McMillan to the Scientific and Medical Network in Rome (September-October 2017). The paper dealt with mechanistic and finalistic accounts of time as 'whole' in the thought of French philosopher Henri Bergson, a pivotal figure in the thought of both C.G. Jung and Gilles Deleuze. The paper responded to logical and ethical problems concerning the power of creative change and connection in accounts of time that reduce change to the realisation of the possible. Evidence of this can be found in the thought of C.G. Jung which the philosophy of Deleuze can help to expose and revaluate.
The paper stimulated lively discussion and requests for further information.

An initial engagement with key historical strands of holistic thought was undertaken. Historically, holistic thought emerged in the late nineteenth century as a reaction to prevailing mechanistic and reductive methods for the study of empirical phenomena. Whilst the roots of holism in conceptions of the 'whole' can be traced back to ancient Greek thought, strands in contemporary holistic thought must be contextualised in relation to more recent notions of liberal autonomy alongside a critical engagement with enlightenment determinations of reason. 

A 'critical' strand of holistic thought and practice involves the investigation of the boundaries of a system. Such a system might include the 'human' being. The logic that might be employed in order to underpin these boundaries is critically scrutinised (whether explicitly or implicitly) within holism often resulting in an extension to the limits that previously defined the system. Under the terms of this extension the system is understood to be able to 'connect' in new ways, often multi-dimensional, within a given field or context. The 'ethical' strands and implications of holism are contained within assumptions that can be identified in the determination of the new boundaries of a system. Ethical implications may be problematic if a new system is determined in relation to a principle which selects, limits, or excludes certain elements of the system based upon criteria which remain extrinsic to the determination of the system itself. 

Both the 'critical' and 'ethical' strands of holistic thought and practice have been examined in relation to the thought of C.G. Jung and Gilles Deleuze. Both thinkers employ conceptions of the 'whole' which encompass transcendent, transcendental, phenomenological and metaphysical logics regarding the determination of systems. Their thought has allowed the research team critically to explore abstract concepts which are often present (implicitly or explicitly) in holistic accounts of the determination of systems. For Jung the psychic system or 'whole-self' refers beyond an encapsulated or embodied psyche to psychic 'reality' in general, including an interconnected world, the 'unus mundus'. Psychic experience engages us in forging new connections beyond those limited, separated, or excluded by the ego. Jung's account of the intrinsic determination of psychic connections can be supplemented by Deleuze's philosophical account of intrinsic modalities of difference and their role in the determination of structure in general. The determination of a system which relies on an intrinsic account of difference is considered to be less ethically ambiguous than a system which relies on extrinsic determination.

Another finding is that the implicit metaphysics in Jung's psychology is a form of panentheism and that such metaphysics undoes the anti-holistic (dualistic and reductive) implications of disenchanted world views, which are rooted in a metaphysics of theism. This finding will be important in comparisons with Deleuze's thinking about the whole, which also opposes theism but aims at a viewpoint of pure immanence and has therefore been characterised as pantheistic.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that our interim and further findings might be put to use by psychotherapists whom we shall engage through an international conference ('Holism: possibilities and problems') in September 2017, through a practitioner symposium ('Holism and psychoanalysis') in November 2017, and through publications in practitioner journals (including thematic issues guest-edited by members of the project team). Above all, we expect the focus of our project on logical and ethical implications to prompt greater reflection among psychotherapists about the holistic dimensions of their practice. Other holistic thinkers and practitioners, in other areas of healthcare, in education, in ecology, and in the creative arts, among other areas, could be similarly challenged to think more widely and critically about the ethical aspects of their views.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B793930D-3FEA-47CB-B41E-C71F1A3DC890</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c660f4721d80.23350708</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://oneworldprojectholism.wordpress.com/2016/08/22/stage-1-introductory-comments-on-holism/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C162D0EF-F32B-4E38-AEFB-993ABEA3C5CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Panentheism and the undoing of disenchantment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aafee28a642ee1d49ef7c56b7091aa1a"><gtr:id>aafee28a642ee1d49ef7c56b7091aa1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Main R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6885a397201.93545610</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B65B3F0-5917-4064-AEF9-35467B1F09D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>PANENTHEISM AND THE UNDOING OF DISENCHANTMENT</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Zygon?</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aafee28a642ee1d49ef7c56b7091aa1a"><gtr:id>aafee28a642ee1d49ef7c56b7091aa1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Main R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc512e89316.47723705</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N003853/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>63465D3B-7F4F-4288-85C7-B62406DCFA58</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Alternative Spiritualities</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B726621-12A9-419F-B798-630155FB0A8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
