A recent development is a class of models, called nonparametric Bayesian models in statistics, that are capable both of integrating prior knowledge about the data and of adapting to the complexity of a given data set. My research will contribute to our understanding of the mathematical mechanisms underlying these models, and to our ability to apply them to new problems.My approach builds on two mathematical concepts, projective limits techniques and representation theorems derived from symmetry properties of data. Projective limits are mathematical tools that assemble a complex mathematical object from many simple components. Based on the projective limit tools available in probability theory and other branches of mathematics, I will develop projective limit methods for nonparametric Bayesian models. Such methods will allow us to solve problems involving complex models -- studying their mathematical properties, or applying them to data -- by solving the corresponding problems for simpler models and re-assembling the solutions.A complementary question to the properties and evaluation of a specific model is which model to use for given data -- the fundamental question facing every dataanalyst in practice. Representation theorems relate symmetry properties of data to the class of models compatible with these properties. These are deep mathematical results of great practical utility: They translate simple, intuitive properties of data into characterizations of models adequate for such data. The most well-known example, de Finetti's theorem, has long been a corner stone of Bayesian statistics, but many results have only emerged as recently as the past decade.In my research, I will study (1) the construction and analysis of nonparametric Bayesian models by means of projective limits, (2) the derivation of models from recent results on symmetry principles and representations, and (3) the interplay between these two formalisms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Statistics and machine learning have come to play an important role in science, technology, and other aspects of modern life, and it is probably fair to say that nonparametric Bayesian methods currently constitute one of the most topical research areas in either field. The main purpose of my research is to broaden the scope of these methods by leveraging tools from measure theory and mathematical probability. Academic impact The immediate beneficiary of my research will be the academic community in the UK and beyond. In particular, results will be relevant to applied statisticians and researchers in machine learning interested in the derivation of new statistical models within the nonparametric Bayesian framework, and in the application of these models to problems in data analysis. The main avenue for dissemination will be high-impact journals and conferences in both statistics and machine learning (e.g. the Annals of Statistics and the Journal of Machine Learning Research). I will also submit to the top conferences in machine learning, which are fully peer-reviewed. I regularly attend and present at the relevant meetings in statistics and machine learning, and visit other academic institutions to present my research. An important aspect of my work is to make tools from probability theory and other relevant fields of mathematics more accessible for more applied researchers. As part of my activities during the fellowship period, I have specific plans for two survey articles, one on nonparametric Bayesian clustering and related models (with Z. Ghahramani), and one providing an introduction to the relevant theory. Impact beyond academia Several branches of modern technology have come to rely heavily on methods of applied and computational statistics. Examples include biotechnology, Internet search and data mining, medical imaging, and computational finance. As a fellow, I would be hosted in a research group at Cambridge that has active collaborations with financial institutions and Microsoft Research. The group's expertise on applied statistics and data analysis has been sought by companies including Google, Yahoo and Amazon. Some of the theoretical questions in my research are motivated by research problems arising from these collaborations, and my solutions would be of direct relevance to the problems. My proposed work on the mathematical foundations of Bayesian nonparametric models will help with the development of new computational tools for the modeling analysis of large data sets. The interest in this area by the named companies suggests that the work, despite its mathematical nature, is of economic relevance and could have a positive impact on the UK economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>289420</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E057E239-AB9B-4772-A703-0B7295AFDDD0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Projective limit random probabilities on Polish spaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Electronic Journal of Statistics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/14a72a93a9dd09e399c2cc19c2435782"><gtr:id>14a72a93a9dd09e399c2cc19c2435782</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Orbanz P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07c07cc18acc5</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I026827/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
