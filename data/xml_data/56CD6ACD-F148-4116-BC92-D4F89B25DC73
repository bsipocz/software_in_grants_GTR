&lt;p>Citizen science is an activity that is becoming increasingly important as demand for data on biodiversity outstrips the financial and manpower capacity of professional scientists to supply it. Dr Geoghegan will trace the new ?Tree Health Surveillance Framework? for Britain, conducting empirical research with citizen scientists, plant pathologists, technicians and users of citizen data, as well as international comparative research on citizen monitoring projects in Australia, a leader in biosecurity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As well as investigating the socio-personal implications of enthusiasm, the research will offer a deeper understanding of how citizen science practices are articulated. Topics will include the use of Web 2.0 technologies, the requirements of scientists involved in studying and managing environments for health, and the relative contribution of citizen data to the resulting science.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>She will work in partnership with Forest Research, Sylva Foundation, and the Science Museum. Dr Geoghegan will collaborate with colleagues at the University of Washington and McGill University, as well as spend time as a Visiting Fellow at the Australian Centre for Cultural Environment Research at the University of Wollongong.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the 1960s/70s, Dutch elm disease killed some 30 million trees, affecting the provision of multiple economic, social and environmental benefits. The benefits of trees to carbon sequestration, biodiversity and recreation are valued at just under &amp;pound;1.1 billion annually (UK National Ecosystem Assessment 2011). The potential impact of citizens acting as an early-warning system for potential tree disease or pest epidemics is significant. Thus, there are a myriad of non-academic beneficiaries and users for this research. 

Project Partner Organisations: All have been enthusiastic about the research and its potential contribution, as well as instrumental in framing research questions. They will be able to use outputs at all stages of the research to inform and formulate current and future citizen science, specifically Forest Research's 'Tree Health Surveillance Framework', the Sylva Foundation's TreeWatch scheme and the Science Museum's Public History initiatives to engage citizens online and off-site with science and technology. Two longer-term impacts relate to the value of our partnership to enhance the research capacity of these organisations, particularly the Sylva Foundation and the Science Museum, as well as contributing toward environmental sustainability as citizen science projects develop.

Environmental Organisations and Charities: Bodies involved in citizen projects and tree health, such as The Royal Forestry Society, The Royal Horticultural Society, Woodland Trust, National Trust, Tree Council, Confor, Scottish Royal Forestry Society, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and Institute of Chartered Foresters, will benefit from international best practice and technological innovation. A wider group of organisations, traditionally involved in citizen science, such as National Biodiversity Network, Trees for Cities, The Bumblebee Conservation Trust and British Hedgehog Preservation Society to name a few, will benefit from the translation of the value of citizen science actvities for scientists, government and other funders. 

Government Bodies: The 'Natural Choice' and 'Giving' White Papers detail the role of voluntary monitoring in enabling citizens to connect with their local environments and communities, and 'volunteer time spent in biodiversity conservation' is used as a biodiversity indicator by Defra. This research will benefit bodies, such as Defra, Fera, Forestry Commission, Environment Agency and Natural England, charged with engaging citizens on the environmental. It will offer understandings of harnessing citizen enthusiasm for science, public engagement with risk, citizens as early-warning systems, as well as monitoring environments for health.

Voluntary Sector: Participation in citizen science projects is predominantly a voluntary activity. Organisations and advocacy groups supporting volunteering will benefit from in-depth understandings of enthusiasm for participation and international best practice, as well as possible local environmental improvement, social inclusion, capacity building and active citizenship. Beneficiaries include but are not limited to: National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Volunteering England, TimeBank, BTCV, Greenspace and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers.

Citizens and wider public: This includes research participants, the wider body of citizen scientists, as well as current non-participants who will join-in as citizen science becomes more widely accepted. As the project findings feed into policy and practice in the UK and internationally, the research will further encourage environmental citizenship, contributing to awareness, well-being and resilience to change, as well as enhancing the relationship between government bodies and citizens.

My research will also benefit international users similar to those listed above, as well as businesses and charities interested in the users of their technologies, for example ESRI (GIS) and the Citizen Cyberscience Centre.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>169600</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Radio 4 Today Programme media interest (citizen science)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAC61EB5-D415-4E58-96E4-2A6726532E20</gtr:id><gtr:impact>interview sparked requests for more information about my research and national research interest afterwards.
