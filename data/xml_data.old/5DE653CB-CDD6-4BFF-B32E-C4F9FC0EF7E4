&lt;p>Given recent events in international relations (US/European/Middle Eastern conflicts), cities and towns (the race riots in France; conflicts in Israel, Gaza and Bosnia) and the developing world (Haiti and Latin America), it is therefore extremely timely to explore the applicability of agonism across a range of academic and practical disciplines.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>We plan to develop the seminars into a network; already receiving support from Cornell and Shanghai Universities and the Economic and Social Research Council for further development into China.&amp;nbsp;This network will also result in the launch of a new journal, an ongoing public engagement programme and PhD studentships, the first of which starts in September 2006.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20511</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series resulted in the establishment of a network entitled 'The Spaces of Democracy' network.

Building from the initial few seminars funded by ESRC, this now takes places through 17 institutions globally. 

Hundreds of events have been held through this now self-sustaining network.

The part of the network that has had the most significant societal impact is that concerning the nature of radical politics today. The debates have provided a useful opportunity to analyse the nature of different radical responses to the economic crisis. Participants and those who have covered these events have therefore been given the opportunity to stand back and then reflect on the nature of what we mean by radical politics today.

The network has been covered through numerous media, including the BBC, Counterpoint, Compass, the British Council, Left Foot Forward, Fabian Review, Total Politics, Red Pepper, Town and Country Planning and the Big Issue. For example, the The New Statesman gave the book 'What is Radical Politics Today?' away as an incentive to new subscribers to the magazine.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2ECC923F-5B94-4961-8074-24955E46DD2A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54450bb1bebc33.60989693</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series resulted in the establishment of a network entitled 'The Spaces of Democracy' network.

These have been picked up by a range of organisations, including Compass, the British Council and Institute for Education.
