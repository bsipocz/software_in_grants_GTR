Agriculture was introduced to Europe from west Asia 10,000 years ago and, during the next 3000 years, spread through Europe by two principal routes, one following the Danube and Rhine valleys through central Europe and into northern Europe (including Britain), and the second taking a coastal route through Italy and Spain to northwest Europe. The extent to which agriculture spread because of human migration, or through the transmission of ideas between existing hunter-gatherer groups, is a debate which can potentially be resolved by comparing the rate of spread in different geographic areas with variation in environmental and cultural factors. A widely held view of agricultural dispersal is that it spread rapidly into Greece and the Balkans, but slowed when it reached central Hungary before again moving rapidly through central Europe. Further delays in the adoption of agriculture have been suggested for the north European plain and Alpine foreland. On the other hand, the spread along the Mediterranean coast was apparently rapid throughout. Recently, however, doubt has been cast on the supposed delays in agricultural spread, which has left researchers debating the causes for variation in the rate of spread while the existence of delays is itself debated. Evidence for the rate of spread is based on radiocarbon dating but most of the dates are based on wood charcoal collected from sites classified as 'Neolithic' on the basis of objects found during archaeological excavation, rather than on cultivated cereals which are the products of agriculture. This project will directly date the earliest cereals (wheat and barley) found on Neolithic sites across Europe. The statistical tools used to analyse radiocarbon dates are also underdeveloped and assume that they provide a single date or 'time-stamp'. However, since radiocarbon dates are in fact an estimate of the actual date, they can be used as time-stamps only when the uncertainty on the date estimates is ignored, which is inappropriate. Another source of uncertainty arises due to fluctuations in the amount of radioactive carbon in the earth's atmosphere: dates based on radiocarbon do not exactly match actual calendar age. When radiocarbon dates are 'translated' into actual dates there may be a choice of more than one highly plausible date. We will develop a statistical model which takes account of the uncertainty of radiocarbon dates when mapping the spread of cultivated cereals across Europe. The new chronological framework, incorporating a large number of radiocarbon dates (both old and new) for cereals, will provide a powerful tool for testing hypotheses concerning agricultural spread.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>403797</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>137 new radiocarbon dates were acquired on early neolithic charred crop remains throughout Europe, and a further 410 radiocarbon dates of charred crop remains were collated from published sources, grey literature and personal communications. Together these provided radiocarbon dates for the earliest crop remains at 170 early Neolithic sites, which formed the basis of a Bayesian analysis of the initial spread of crops across Europe. We have developed a statistical framework for modelling dispersal as a spatio-temporal phenomenon. This framework models space as a network based on a set of points representing sites of archaeological interest, with the possibility of spread between sites represented by links between them. The links between the points are constrained to include links of inherent importance e.g. to represent major rivers. The key parameters in this framework are the arrival times of the process (based on dates of individual crop seeds) at each point in the network. Dependency between arrival times is modelled by assuming that the process spreads along the links in the network, with travel time along each link taking into account the geographical distance and the type of link (e.g. coastal vs. `cross-country'). Statistical inference within this framework uses a Bayesian approach, involving prior expectations for the travel times along the links in the network. We are able to answer questions relating to the timing of the arrival of the crops, the rate and direction of their spread, and the likelihood of specific routes having been followed. For presentation and interpretation of results, we have developed a range of visualisation tools, used for both estimates of arrival time and for measures of uncertainty. We have applied a range of spatio-temporal models of this form to the dataset on the arrival of crops. In order to investigate the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of initial crop cultivation, existing palaeovegetation maps were scanned, simplified and digitised in ArcGIS. The vegetation zones have been used to aid interpretation of the results from the network model, by providing an ecological framework against which to compare rates and direction of agricultural spread.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The radiocarbon dates may be used directly by other researchers in the field, and the Bayesian model of the initial spread of crops across Europe provides a framework for archaeological interpretations relating to the causes and timing of early agricultural spread.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F07A5D02-73A1-4B9D-B067-9C20C25D7DD7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463a222a9de64.60583427</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Tailored code which implements the Bayesian network model using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
