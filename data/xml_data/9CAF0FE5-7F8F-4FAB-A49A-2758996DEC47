It is the leading
cause of death by cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in women
worldwide. It is estimated that 975,000 men and 376,000 women will die from lung cancer in
2007 alone. In India, lung cancer is the most common form of cancer for men. According to a
2007 report by WHO, there are currently over 350 million smokers in China alone. Similarly,
in India, 50 percent of men in the northern states are smokers. This burden of disease will rise.
According to a global youth tobacco survey conducted by the USA-Centre for Disease Control
(CDC), the most frequent users of tobacco products were Southeast Asian students, ranging
from ages 13 to 15 (Aleea Farrakh.) The Global Burden of Cancer. USA-National Cancer
Institute. December 20, 2007 (available on line at www.cancer.gov/) accessed 24 Oct 2009).
The problem for GPs is when to investigate or refer. Most patients with lung cancer come
from a population with chronic respiratory symptoms. If each GP were to refer for imaging
every time a new respiratory symptom appeared in a smoker (as advised in countless articles,
guidelines and textbooks) then the healthcare infrastructure would be ill-equipped to cope
with demand and this could be seen as an inefficient use of resources. The lack of availability
of suitable tools for use in primary care, to aid diagnosis and hence referral to a specialist is a
constant cause of frustration for Oncologists, since the 5 year survival rates for these patients
is low.
In order to have an effective screening programme for lung cancer, tumours need to be
identified at the T1, (3cm or less diameter) NO, (before nodal involvement), MO (before the
tumour has metastasised) stage. Surgical resection is usually possible at this stage, achieving a
complete cure.
Anaxsys has developed a unique patented fast response moisture sensor that responds in real
time to water vapour. Serial breaths can be measured as the sensor is returned to its pre-test
state almost instantly. The resultant humidograms (analysis of aerosol moisture content in the
breath) comment on a broad range of diseases including asthma and COPD (chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease)Preliminary results show that a specific morphology of the
humidogram suggests the possibility of a lung cancer that would indicate the need for a
diagnostic procedure. Tumours smaller than 3cm diameter have already been identified in this
way.
Anaxsys is now planning to undertake a proof of concept programme in UK. This will
involve a clinical study to determine the sensitivity and selectivity of its sensors with respect
to lung cancer at the point of diagnosis (following referral by their GP to a hospital chest
clinic) and the development of a basic prototype for a feasibility study in lung cancer
screening.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710047</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
