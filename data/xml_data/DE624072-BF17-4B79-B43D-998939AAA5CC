In some cases they are inherent to the situation, for example music concerts and the theatre. However, they are often a nuisance, for example noise from vehicles (internally and externally), loud music and energy generation. In some cases they have strategic or health importance, such as with sonar imaging. Sound and vibration can also be harnessed to accomplish important functions, such as ultrasound imaging. They are also a source of energy through energy harvesting techniques, potentially allowing the efficiency of devices to be improved. Therefore the control of sound and vibration is important in many applications. The physical properties of conventional materials are limited by their chemical and physical structure. The recent emergence of metamaterials broadens the range of possible physical properties. This allows pressure waves (i.e. the transmission of sound and vibration) to be controlled with much more freedom than is conventionally possible. Novel applications of these materials include an acoustic invisibility cloak and sub-wavelength imaging devices. The key aims of the project are to develop metamaterial designs which solve two of the significant limitations of current metamaterials. The novel characteristics of current metamaterials are limited to a narrow frequency band fixed at manufacture. This severely limits their application. The project aims to improve this repsonse by embedding active elements in the material the response can be controlled and adapted. This leads to materials which have a significantly enhanced flexibility and as a consequence are much more applicable. Most current metamaterials require a fluid or gas as one of the key components in their construction. This severely limits their application to many problems, for example those which are embedded in a moving fluid. The active approach provides the ability to emulate key components of metamaterials using a control system. By intrinsically removing these components from the material, the limiting condition of requiring a background fluid is removed. The active approach thus leads to the possibility of creating a completely solid metamaterial.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The effects of sound and vibration throughout society and industry are broad and varied. Acoustic metamaterials have a wide applicability due to their unique capability to freely control the propagation of sound waves. Within industry, these metamaterials potentially supply the ability to significantly improve the performance of existing devices in addition to realizing new concepts. Application areas include optimization of ultrasound imaging devices, energy harvesting devices, acoustics of concert venues and theatres and seismic protection. Conversely the UK government has recently published a noise policy statement in response to the EU's Noise Directive. This outlines the potential impact of the EU directive in terms of its effect on local councils, transport providers and manufacturers. Metamaterials could in the future provide more effective noise insulation properties. This could lead to lighter and thinner sound insulation materials. The impact of these materials would include less physical intrusion in terms of their size and a reduction in weight through the use of thinner insulation leading to, among other things, improved fuel efficiency if installed in vehicles. This influences not only industry through design and production of suitable products, but also the wider public and government policy. For example, the ability to provide improved energy efficiency aids the reduction of the UK's carbon footprint. Reduced noise and improved medical imaging enhances health and wellbeing and influences governmental policy and professional standards. These applications are likely to lead to the development of new devices for existing companies, providing job security. They are also likely to lead to potential spin-out companies specializing in metamaterial research, manufacture and installation, thus creating new jobs. This proposal would provide a starting point in developing methods and procedures to develop applicable and adaptable acoustic metamaterials.The applicant will lead and carefully manage the dissemination of the results, with input from collaborators and the University where necessary. The high level technical work will be disseminated within the associated and related research communities, through journal publications, conferences and seminars. The work disseminated to industry, other application areas and policy makers will include the appropriate technical results, but will also focus on how these results can be exploited and integrated into existing or new practices. This will be done through appropriate conferences, seminars and technology fairs. Work disseminated to the wider public, schools and in some cases policy makers, will concentrate on why this research is important, interesting and what impact it will have on the audience. This will be done through public engagement talks, demonstrations and a purposely designed and monitored website. The University Research and Innovation Services will be used to ensure that the impact of the research and any possible commercial exploitation are fully realised. The University of Sheffield has a successful track record in terms of exploitation of the research done at the University. This is evidenced by their partnership with Fusion IP (www.fusionip.co.uk). The University media relations and impact team will be used if necessary to disseminate the research findings through any appropriate media streams. In addition the research associate requested for the project will receive any training deemed appropriate to aid with the dissemination and impact of the work. This is supported through schemes such as the University Research Leaders Program. Potential future developments to the UKIERI link and application for CASE Studentships will strengthen the educational aspect and student involvement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have experimentally demonstrated that a system can be designed and controlled that has properties that would not be found in natural materials.
