new glacial isostatic adjustment model for Antarctica</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K009958/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Antarctic Ice Sheet is currently melting and undergoing rapid dynamic change. However, the rate at which it is melting, and hence its contribution to sea-level rise, is currently poorly known. The aim of my Fellowship is to derive a better estimate of current ice-mass change across Antarctica. Such an estimate can be derived from satellite gravity data, which are used to infer ice-mass changes from measurements of the Earth's gravity field. However, these data must be corrected for the ongoing effects of postglacial rebound (also known as glacial isostatic adjustment; GIA).
Satellite gravity measurements cannot distinguish between changes in ice mass and mass movement of the solid Earth. During the last glaciation the Antarctic Ice Sheet was much larger and the extra mass caused the land beneath the ice to subside. As the ice sheet shrank towards its present size, the land began to rebound. This process - GIA - continues today due to the viscous nature of Earth's mantle. In fact, the GIA signal, as recorded by satellite gravity data, can be of the same magnitude as the signal due to current ice-mass change. Therefore, it is vital to constrain the pattern of GIA as accurately as possible in order to determine the pattern of ice-mass change.
I will address two fundamental problems with the methods currently used to model GIA in Antarctica, thus significantly reducing the uncertainty on Antarctica's sea-level contribution.
In the first part of my Fellowship I will model the 3D Earth structure beneath Antarctica. Current Antarctic GIA models do not account for variations in crustal thickness or mantle viscosity. However, such variations are known to be large because East and West Antarctica have very different geological histories: the crust beneath East Antarctica is old and 'stiff' and thus will not deform easily under loading. In contrast, the crust beneath West Antarctica is young and 'weak' and so deforms more easily under loading. In order to realistically determine the rebound signal, spatial variations in Earth structure must be accounted for so that the correct response to loading is calculated; not doing so can alter the rebound signal by up to 30%. The recent acquisition of new data relating to Antarctic Earth structure, and GIA model developments, make this aspect of my proposal very timely.
The second problem I will address is related to sea-level change. West Antarctica is a marine-based ice sheet meaning that its bed is grounded below present sea level. In order to model changes in ice extent over time, and hence determine the GIA signal, it is necessary to consider feedbacks between sea-level change and ice dynamics. Sea level directly controls the position where an ice sheet begins to float and thus where ice is lost to the ocean. However, due to GIA, sea level does not vary uniformly over time: In areas where the ice sheet grows the land is pushed down by the extra load and the sea surface is drawn upwards due to the increased gravitational attraction of the ice sheet, resulting in an increase in sea level. The opposite happens when ice retreats. In both cases, feedbacks influence the dynamical behaviour of the ice sheet. Such feedbacks are not accounted for in current ice-sheet models, despite their potential to increase the stability of an ice sheet: Their inclusion could fundamentally alter predictions of ice-sheet behaviour under future sea-level rise scenarios. In the second component of my project I will therefore develop a coupled GIA-ice-sheet model. Both fields of research will benefit from improved model capabilities.
These model improvements will be used to derive a more realistic estimate of GIA across Antarctica. The model will be calibrated to fit field constraints relating to former ice extent, past sea-levels, and present-day rebound. It will then be used to correct satellite data for the effects of GIA, and hence determine a more accurate map of current Antarctic ice-mass change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The PI will work with a graphic designer to produce 5 large-format graphic images around the theme of 'Perceptions of Climate Change'. These will be displayed for several months at the Centre for Life, Newcastle, and at the 2014 British Science Festival in Birmingham.

The aim of the project is to challenge the general public's perceptions of climate change. This will be achieved by producing images which both quickly convey a simple message, but also to invite you to look closer and explore the details of the image. An example of this is the use of many smaller images to make up a larger image, essentially a mosaic. The concept is very similar to the challenge facing scientists who study climate change and the impact of climate change: typically, only the smaller images are available to us - a regional temperature record, or local tide gauge data - and these must be pieced together to understand the bigger picture. These parallels will be explored in producing the images, and easy-to-grasp facts will be include in infographic designs to increase the impact of the message. The images will enable the general public to identify the signs of climate change around them, and appreciate the challenge faced by scientists of understanding the bigger picture.

The general public will be the direct beneficiaries of the project, through an increased awareness of, and engagement with, issues surrounding climate change. The aim of the project is not to convey large amounts of complicated information to the general public, but to encourage them to explore their own perception of the process of climate change. The PI will attend the 2014 British Science Festival in order to maximise the impact of the images through direct contact with the general public. In addition, the possibility of hosting a 'Meet the Scientist' event, in conjunction with the longer-term exhibition at the Centre for Life, will be explored, to facilitate knowledge transfer and promote public discussion.

Secondary beneficiaries of the project will be local, regional, and national agencies that are involved with planning activities associated with mitigating against, or adapting to, climate change. It is hoped that the increased awareness by the general public of the challenge involved in understanding climate change will allow them to engage with proposed planning agency activities in a positive way, and to appreciate the long-term nature of the issue. Such planning agencies will be made aware of, and invited to engage with, the project.

The impact of this project will be to broaden public perception of the process of climate change. This will help to break down barriers between scientists, policy makers, and the general public, enabling us to work together towards understanding and adapting to the challenge of climate change.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>406340</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A video was produced that was shown as part of a wider exhibition on Antarctic exploration and science (listed under engagement activities).</gtr:description><gtr:id>0CB121FD-72B9-4EF2-8BC4-1226FE743776</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public awareness of current change in Antarctica. the exhibition was attended by ~4400 members of the public over three and a half months.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e05b1d003294.50566376</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Antarctic Exhibition Video</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>POLENET</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>3D GIA modelling</gtr:description><gtr:id>44F8E1DE-2C6D-4CC0-91E4-661025CC2A6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One publication has already resulted from this collaboration (van der Wal et al., 2015), and a second is in preparation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e40163893d5.20011007-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sharing of data and model code.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Numerical modelling making use of data received from one partner, and delivery of model output to both partners</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>3D GIA modelling</gtr:description><gtr:id>09203BF4-1115-4DEF-B02C-817207EFBD2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One publication has already resulted from this collaboration (van der Wal et al., 2015), and a second is in preparation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e40163893d5.20011007-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sharing of data and model code.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Numerical modelling making use of data received from one partner, and delivery of model output to both partners</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>PhD Studentship at Newcastle University</gtr:description><gtr:id>911059F4-38B5-4453-801F-DF533856748C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9bb9e3fe781.16978148-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Two of the student's supervisors (including the lead supervisor) are based at Newcastle University.

We have shown that the signal associated with this process is smaller than previously thought, which has led to revisions to currents estimates for the rate and location of contemporary ice loss from Antarctica.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this work feed into a greater understanding of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet responds to external climate forcing, and provide updated estimates of the current sea-level contribution from Antarctica.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>15F78528-646A-41D1-A3F7-3AD0A372BEF1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0614f8b4286.77810232</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C962DC16-F239-40CF-AF50-D1479B4629E0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Low post-glacial rebound rates in the Weddell Sea due to Late Holocene ice-sheet readvance</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad4612202bc5f92a97d4fd783e4446b2"><gtr:id>ad4612202bc5f92a97d4fd783e4446b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bradley S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55fa9da9da006cfe</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CE5C300D-4D07-4A68-BBF3-E4ACDCAF570B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Incomplete separability of Antarctic plate rotation from glacial isostatic adjustment deformation within geodetic observations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geophysical Journal International</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2b803e20a2137ff42c8cf98566810c0d"><gtr:id>2b803e20a2137ff42c8cf98566810c0d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>King M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df1307452b14.29754440</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B61E174E-FDE7-47E4-BE19-B72806B2D372</gtr:id><gtr:title>Uplift rates from a new high-density GPS network in Palmer Land indicate significant late Holocene ice loss in the southwestern Weddell Sea</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geophysical Journal International</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6db65b0d52796a3f1c488d05171ad5f7"><gtr:id>6db65b0d52796a3f1c488d05171ad5f7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolstencroft M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df1307d86b71.12912221</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48A37C44-A7F8-4CC8-A40E-4E63A695FCCE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Revisiting GRACE Antarctic ice mass trends and accelerations considering autocorrelation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35619bdd4f121fbd894e14e53a51c608"><gtr:id>35619bdd4f121fbd894e14e53a51c608</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545e383ce5d209.87629610</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3416521B-7E65-4CE4-97FF-E7B30244BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Glacial isostatic adjustment in response to changing Late Holocene behaviour of ice streams on the Siple Coast, West Antarctica</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geophysical Journal International</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/47eb8825f5aeded184d118ce01a95442"><gtr:id>47eb8825f5aeded184d118ce01a95442</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nield G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df1395cd7fe2.23206615</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>73B1E165-AF20-4FCC-8D01-45967E768DA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Current state and future perspectives on coupled ice-sheet -
