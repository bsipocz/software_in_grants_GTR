Evolution has primed responses to heal adult wounds quickly, but imperfectly, resulting in scar formation. High levels of pro-fibrotic chemical signals in the wound promote excessive inflammation and dermal fibroblast activity and result in wound scarring. However, in the embryo, low levels of pro-fibrotic chemical signals and high levels of anti-fibrotic chemical signals temper these processes and ensure that the wound regenerates perfectly. 100 million patients in the developed world heal with a scar every year as a result of elective procedures, trauma and burn injuries, causing serious cosmetic and functional problems that can be emotionally and physically debilitating and place a heavy financial burden on Health Care Systems. There are currently no clinically tested pharmaceuticals available to prevent the occurrence of wound scarring. 

Previously, I have demonstrated that a functional beta2-adrenoceptor (B2AR) network exists in the skin, but the role of the B2AR in wound scarring is unknown. Preliminary data shows that B2ARs activation alters the balance of chemical signals in the wound towards levels seen in embryonic wounds, where wounds heal without scars. Indeed, B2AR agonists reduce wound inflammation and reduce dermal fibroblast activity in wounds. In contrast, B2AR antagonists shift the balance of chemical signals in the opposite direction and enhance fibroblast activity in wounds. The ability of B2AR agonists to alter the composition of the chemical cocktail in the wound to resemble that found in the embryo, together with their ability to reduce inflammation and fibroblast activity, support their investigation as an anti-scarring treatment. B2AR agonists are known to be safe, well-tolerated pharmaceuticals evidenced by their long-standing use for the treatment of asthma and could have significant potential as a future treatment to reduce wound scarring. 

Here we describe a proof of concept study to determine if B2AR agonists can reduce wound scarring. We also explore the underlying mechanisms in focused studies using appropriate models to investigate these physiological processes. 
The results will lead to a better understanding of the physiological processes of wound healing and scarring and hopefully lead to the development of a treatment to prevent wound scarring in patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Wound healing is a complex process requiring the activation of numerous processes in concert. Evolution has primed responses to heal adult wounds quickly, but imperfectly, resulting in scar formation. A plethora of pro-fibrotic growth factors (GFs) promote excessive inflammation and dermal fibroblast activity resulting in wound fibrosis and scarring. However, in the embryo, low levels of pro-fibrotic GFs and high levels of anti-fibrotic GFs ensure that tissue regenerates perfectly. 100 million patients in the developed world heal with a scar every year as a result of elective procedures, trauma and burn injuries, causing serious cosmetic and functional problems that can be emotionally and physically debilitating and place a heavy financial burden on Health Care Systems. There are currently no clinically-tested pharmaceuticals available to prevent the occurrence of wound fibrosis and scarring. 

Previously, I have demonstrated that a functional beta2-adrenoceptor (B2AR) network exists in the skin, but the role of the B2AR in wound scarring is unknown. Preliminary data shows that B2AR activation decreases the levels of pro-fibrotic GFs and increases the levels of anti-fibrotic GFs secreted from dermal fibroblasts. Indeed, B2AR agonists temper wound inflammation and reduce dermal fibroblast activity in vivo. In contrast, B2AR antagonists increase dermal fibroblast secreted pro-fibrotic GFs and enhance fibroblast activity in vivo. B2AR agonists are known to be safe, well-tolerated pharmaceuticals evidenced by their long-standing use for the treatment of asthma and could have significant potential as a future treatment to reduce wound scarring. 

This proposal describes a proof of concept study to determine if B2AR agonists can reduce wound scarring in vivo. We will use an established rabbit ear scar model to study their effect on skin wound scars. We will also explore the B2AR-mediated modulation of expression and secretion of pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) 1 and 2 and anti-fibrotic TGFB3 from primary human cells including platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells. Finally, we will investigate the role of the B2AR in modulating fibroblast activity using tethered collagen gels as a 3D model of the wound dermis. 

The results of the work will determine if B2AR agonists reduce wound scarring in vivo. The in vitro work will also lead to a better understanding of the physiological processes of wound healing and the pathophysiological processes involved in wound scarring. We hope that the work in this proposal will form the basis for future clinical trials.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304897</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>15000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Innovation fund</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>The Lachesis Fund</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1683D7DC-5ACB-42CF-BA3D-3CBEBF46051C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>dbQ4g4daNjs</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Daniel Turnberg?Memorial Fund</gtr:department><gtr:description>Daniel Turnberg Middle East Travel Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>DA2C3FF6-5F83-4372-BD30-D36B74F02B4D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>BgQBZzMB57c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>This patent describes the use of a beta adrenoceptor agonist to reduce fibroblast activity and consequently to reduce wound scarring</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>G0901844</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>7F48F1DB-D94F-49BF-802A-0B3468FF7C87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funding as been obtained from a venture capital company in addition to the MRC to support a proof of principle on scar reduction</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>STAXAFU7oFE</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:patentId>US2011201691</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Modulation of fibroblast activity</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2011</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A method for improving skin scar colour matching, for example reducing scar hyperpigmentation, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an agent, which positively modulates [beta]2-adrenergic receptor conformation, or receptor activity, or activation thereof, to a subject in need thereof. The subject typically is in need of improving skin scar colour matching, for example reducing scar hyperpigmentation, because the subject has or is at risk of hyperpigmentation. The subject typically is selected as being at risk of hyperpigmentation on the basis of one or more of the following factors: the subject has previously developed hyperpigmentation of a scar - the subject tans readily on exposure to sunshine or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, rather than burning - the subject has a non-Caucasian racial origin - the subject's skin colour (for example in an area that is not tanned) is considered to be darker than that typical of a naturally fair-haired Caucasian person. The subject may be selected as being at risk of hyperpigmentation because they are at least predominantly of Chinese, black African, Asian or Southern European racial origin, and/or if their skin type can be assessed under the Fitzpatrick Scale as Type III, IV, V or VI.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>G0901844</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>657D80F5-609C-435F-AC5A-9405ADD229B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Supported the submission of a DPFS grant in November 2014</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>54523ee927c6e0.66187540</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:patentId>WO2014135896</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>METHODS</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2014</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6FFAA6B8-8AAD-4676-BB00-6277B7B72099</gtr:id><gtr:title>?2-adrenoceptor activation modulates skin wound healing processes to reduce scarring.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of investigative dermatology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/751356b4501ad34ba74cd6ab1c6402e3"><gtr:id>751356b4501ad34ba74cd6ab1c6402e3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Le Provost GS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-202X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_15719_29_25050597</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0F4985F8-7E39-4C87-80E3-66C3EBA65AA3</gtr:id><gtr:title>?2AR antagonists and ?2AR gene deletion both promote skin wound repair processes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of investigative dermatology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/501c43878a1741e10c3409cd001c9a0a"><gtr:id>501c43878a1741e10c3409cd001c9a0a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pullar CE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-202X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_15719_29_22495178</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A732C352-A9F6-4C1E-AE1E-381DE5FCF231</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rat model of burn wound healing: effect of Botox.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/027a3ae4e326825f327a091748f1c967"><gtr:id>027a3ae4e326825f327a091748f1c967</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abdallah Hajj Hussein I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0393-974X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_15719_29_23034258</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8084A1A0-42D1-47E6-B8FA-24A430200965</gtr:id><gtr:title>Beta-Adrenoceptor Activation Reduces Both Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cell Migration via a cAMP-Dependent Mechanism and Wound Angiogenesis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of cellular physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0d9fd8ad139364fed00f91d6fd65c805"><gtr:id>0d9fd8ad139364fed00f91d6fd65c805</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Leary AP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9541</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_15719_29_24986762</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0901844</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7EE9741E-CF94-420A-B0AB-A7811523CF2C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Skin</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
