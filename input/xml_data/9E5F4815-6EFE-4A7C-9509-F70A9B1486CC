Network (ARCC CN)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L005700/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The performance of the UK built environment and its infrastructure is critical to national well-being, the growth agenda and economic competitiveness and stability. Yet these increasingly complex and interdependent sectors face serious challenges over the next 10-50 years and beyond if they are to minimise the risk of systematic failures and disruptions and be capable of responding positively to expected demographic, environmental and technological changes. 

In order to meet these challenges, decision-makers at the national, regional and local levels need the best available information and evidence from the research community in a format that can be incorporated into policy and practice. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and, more broadly, the Living with Environmental Change partnership, have invested heavily in research to inform this decision-making process. BeXchange aims to maximise and accelerate the impacts and benefits of this research. It will provide a dynamic focussed network that will enable researchers, policymakers and practitioners to work together to ensure timely production of credible research and salient knowledge exchange outputs for use in developing a sustainable built environment. 

Building on existing achievements within the Adaptation and Resilience in a Changing Climate Coordination Network (ARCC CN, EP/G036586/1), BeXchange will work with researchers and a wide range of stakeholders to provide:

- access to knowledge, data and practical tools drawing on research outputs from across the academic community;
- opportunities for facilitated knowledge exchange to better inform and focus research, practice and evidence-gathering activities;
- the means (enabling processes and mechanisms) to contribute to the production of targeted outputs such that the resulting knowledge can be integrated into policy and practice. 

Experience gained within the ARCC CN has demonstrated that facilitated networking and synthesis of results from academia that engages both researchers and other stakeholders enhances the use and ultimately the impacts of the overall research. Stakeholders benefit from the provision of coherent, timely and targeted evidence and outputs that meet their needs. Researchers benefit from engagement of a broader and informed stakeholder community and opportunities to share knowledge, resources, data and results that enhance their own individual pathways to impacts. 

BeXchange will be an open network targeting stakeholders from academia, business, industry, central and local government, professional institutions, voluntary organisations and related networks with an interest in fostering resilience and sustainability in the built environment and infrastructure sectors. These include those stakeholders whose remit is public engagement and international colleagues with interests relevant to the UK.

By providing a focal point for the creation of and access to information and by driving forward coordinated engagement and knowledge exchange activities, BeXchange will become the primary UK source of credible and relevant evidence from research to inform adaptation in the built environment and infrastructure sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Enhancing the uptake and impact of research on adaptation and resilience in the built environment and infrastructure sectors within the UK is the primary aim of BeXchange. Potential beneficiaries are diverse and include: 

- Central government departments, devolved administrations and their agencies: e.g. Defra, DCLG, DECC, DfT, DH, GLA, Cabinet Office, Treasury (Infrastructure UK), SG, WG, SEPA, NIEA, Environment Agency, Highways Agency as well as the Adaptation Sub-Committee within the Climate Change Committee and NHS Trusts, who will benefit from facilitated dialogue and synthesised research outputs targeted at specific policy requirements.
 
- Local government: e.g. local authorities, county and city councils, Local Government Association and overarching organisations such as the Core Cities, who will benefit from a better understanding of the specific risks and opportunities at the regional and local level, together with access to data and tools to aid the decision-making process. 

- Coordination bodies and other research networks: e.g. ClimateXchange, Climate UK and regional partnerships, Adaptation Scotland, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Sustainable Development Research Network, the Water Security and Modern Built Environment Knowledge Transfer Networks, who will benefit from a single, focussed window onto relevant UK research to inform their own initiatives and opportunities for shared activities to broaden overall understanding and reach of information.

- Infrastructure Operators: e.g. the utility companies, EA Infrastructure Operators Adaptation Forum, Energy Networks Association and Transport for London, who will benefit from opportunities to interact with academia to co-produce evidence and knowledge to help reduce risks and costs.

- Professional bodies and institutions: e.g. CIBSE, IMechE, RIBA, ICE CIRIA, who will gain additional synthesised information on relevant issues and opportunities to contribute to focussed activities to inform their members.

- Architects, building designers and developers (including housing associations) who will benefit from additional knowledge and expertise to help provide well-adapted and sustainable buildings to support well-being and productivity in the future.

- Engineering and multi-disciplinary consultants: e.g. Arup, AEA Technology, Atkins, Halcrow, who will benefit from access to the latest models, tools and information to inform their consultancy services both in the UK and internationally, with potential for developing outputs commercially.

BeXchange will work with this wide range of stakeholders recognising that there are varying levels of expertise, requirements and capacity to engage. Pathways to achieving impact will be carefully developed to promote engagement at appropriate levels as required by users, ranging from keeping in touch with developments through to complex co-production of specific outputs.

By building on collaborations, processes and links already established within the ARCC CN and through a carefully designed suite of planned engagement activities, BeXchange is in a strong position to ensure the potential benefits listed above materialise in practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1223982</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Catherine Max Consulting</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ARCC - joint working opportunities with policy and practice</gtr:description><gtr:id>2FD11678-F55F-4477-94C3-17479376959A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A better practical understanding of how research outputs can inform the policy and practice process</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a07e1df6208.16839101-9</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners in policy and practice contribute expertise and knowledge of the decision-making processes to these placements allowing a better overall understanding of how evidence and knowledge from research can be tailored to better meet the needs of practitioners.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The ARCC network supports short placements or secondments for researchers wishing to work more closely with the policy and practice community.

Objectives:
? To identify good practice and expertise developed in knowledge exchange, in stakeholder engagement and in the coordination of interdisciplinary and stakeholder-led research projects as developed within the ARCC network team over the past 6 years.

? To capture and make available this learning to ensure it remains accessible and useful in the future. By sharing learning, this will contribute to the latest thinking on, for example, knowledge exchange and evaluation processes to inform good practice and to
contribute to academic knowledge in this area.'

? To identify those aspects of good practice where greatest value can be achieved as a focus for future activities, both within the ARCC network and the wider community.

? To consider transferable messages of relevance for other EPSRC-funded networks, taking forward learning obtained from the built environment and infrastructure sectors</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leeds</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ARCC - joint working opportunities with policy and practice</gtr:description><gtr:id>90A9FC7F-9C36-4B86-AAF9-21DA74068637</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A better practical understanding of how research outputs can inform the policy and practice process</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a07e1df6208.16839101-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners in policy and practice contribute expertise and knowledge of the decision-making processes to these placements allowing a better overall understanding of how evidence and knowledge from research can be tailored to better meet the needs of practitioners.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The ARCC network supports short placements or secondments for researchers wishing to work more closely with the policy and practice community.

The ARCC network provides a dynamic focussed network environment that enables researchers, policymakers and practitioners within the built environment and infrastructure sectors to expand and accelerate the exchange of evidence and knowledge to stimulate decision-making and innovation, and address both current needs and future challenges.

By providing a comprehensive focal point, the network is working to:

A. Build community cohesion to develop in-depth understanding and synergies across the network by:
? stimulating the engagement of academics and other stakeholders in the co-development, co-generation and dissemination of evidence and knowledge; 
? identifying and promoting links to deliver quality research and outputs that addresses policy and practice priorities; and
? extending the reach of the network and its stakeholders reflecting their needs. 

B. Provision and integration of credible and salient knowledge to help ensure policy and practice are based on the best available evidence by:
? synthesising evidence from across the UK knowledge base
? drawing on relevant international research and knowledge to support the further enhancement of these syntheses.

C. Enhanced accessibility and impact focussing on meeting the varied needs of a diverse stakeholder community by:
? facilitating the communication, dissemination and exchange of evidence in a timely manner
? facilitating access to information and data from research, policy and practice;
? enabling knowledge motivation and integration to enhance uptake and use of network and research outputs; 
? demonstrating the mutual benefits, impacts and cost benefits of co-production; and
? providing a centralised hub and first point of contact for comprehensive information 

The network is recognised and sought after a key UK source of credible and relevant evidence and knowledge from research to inform policies and decisions to enhance the sustainability of the built environment and infrastructure sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>080B72B0-6D00-4D24-8A4D-5966C7A11D70</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>560bd39c1b9438.01111603</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>On-going project.

The ARCC network provides a UK-wide network to develop and exchange knowledge and evidence to inform policy and practice. The focus is on adaptation to change (environmenatl, social, technological) in the built environment and infrastructure sectors.

The performance of the UK built environment and infrastructure systems is critical to national well-being, the growth agenda and economic competitiveness. However, these complex and interdependent sectors face serious challenges if they are to remain resilient to expected future changes.

EPSRC-funded projects provide the focus of the ARCC network, looking at adaptation and resilience in buildings, urban environments, transport networks, water resources and energy systems. Through coordinated activities involving researchers and stakeholders, the network maximises and accelerates the benefits of research to support sustainable urban environments and national infrastructure systems.

By providing a comprehensive focal point for knowledge exchange, information and engagement opportunities for adaptation, the ARCC network seeks to meet policy and practice requirements for credible and salient evidence from across the research community.

The network engages with researchers and a wide range of stakeholders including:
? Central government departments, devolved administrations and their agencies
? Local government
? Infrastructure operators
? Architects, building designers and developers
? Professional bodies and institutions
? Coordination organisations and other knowledge exchange and research networks
? International research programmes

The Network focuses on three core objectives:
? building community cohesion to develop in-depth understanding and synergies across the network
? provision and integration of knowledge to help ensure policy and practice have the best available evidence
? enhanced accessibility and uptake of research outputs to meet the needs of a diverse stakeholder community in a timely manner.

All activities build on EPSRC-funded research to help broaden the uptake, use and impact of outputs beyond that achievable by individual projects. The Network adds value by enabling the effective interpretation, integration and mobilisation of knowledge and potential solutions, maximising the overall benefit from EPSRC funding commitments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>On-going project.
