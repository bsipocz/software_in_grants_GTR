Estimates based on UK incidence data for Bell's palsy patients and those left with residual weakness requiring specialist management (approximately 30%) suggests that to treat all new patients could cost between &amp;pound;2,543,000 (therapy alone) to &amp;pound;7,948,000 (therapy plus botulinum toxin injections) per annum. Approximately 30% of patients affected by facial palsy suffer ongoing chronic disfigurement, anxiety and/or depression. It has been shown that service provision for these patients is limited. Facial palsy management is expensive. With the NHS requiring to save billions annually (NHS, 2011), it is imperative to rethink conventional treatment pathways. 

The NHS National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke physiotherapy recommends 45 minutes daily facial therapy for patients with facial paralysis. To meet the guidelines, each patient would need daily face-to-face therapy for a period of at least 12 weeks (broadly defined as the acute phase), costing the NHS &amp;pound;2,400 per patient. With 26,000 new cases annually this would represent a prohibitive cost of &amp;pound;62,400,000 for these new patients per annum on top of the cost of treating existing patients. However, costs could be reduced by developing a home-based rehabilitative technology, allowing greater numbers of patients to receive gold-standard treatment. The proposed technologies will provide patients with real-time feedback when undergoing therapy at home and thus can significantly reduce the time of visiting therapists for face-to-face feedback.

This project will investigate 4D (dynamic three-dimension) techniques and a computational model integrating Mirror Visual Feedback MVF theory for home-based therapy using a depth sensor. This framework envisions developing easy to use facial palsy therapy technologies, which can provide real-time feedback assessing treatment onses of patients integrating MVF theory. Research studies using MVF therapy to treat phantom limb pain and complex regional pain syndrome have produced promising results. 

Facial palsy patients can recover more quickly if they exercise their facial muscles. However, it can be painful for patients to face mirrors due to the anxiety of looking at their asymmetric and deformed facial features. Therefore, we will apply MVF to adaptively mirror the healthy side of the face and facial movement over the unhealthy side and thus allow patients to observe healthy whole faces when exercising their facial muscles. It has been reported that biofeedback therapy based on MVF has been effective for Bell's facial palsy and hemi-facial pain of trigeminal neuralgia. However, these studies either use a physical mirror box or simple image-based mapping, which provide little feedback or inaccurate facial movement information. Patients have limited awareness of the abnormal movements their faces display so without feedback about these movements their facial functions may worsen, developing permanently abnormal movements. 

Therefore, there is a strong need for novel computational 4D sensing and modelling methods to develop therapy which can capture and map accurate facial muscle movements according to MVF. The ultimate goal is to programme this method into a software package for home-based therapy. Currently, there are no 3D or 4D products or technologies based on MVF available for therapy. Thus, the proposed methods for building computational 4D sensing and modelling models integrating MVF will be hugely beneficial to patients and the NHS by providing appropriate feedback in assessing treatment responses of patients and ultimately improve the ability to scale home-based therapy. It can also be adapted to tele-rehabilitation for practical applications so clinical consultants and therapists can remotely observe patients' home-based therapy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Impact on clinical applications

The project can be considerably beneficial to clinical and healthcare professionals either for clinical or statistical analysis. The direct impact of this work lies in rehabilitation and clinical applications especially regarding facial palsy as it will have practical clinical applications. It provides unique advantages compared with existing conventional methods: 
(a) effective therapy through implementation of Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) 
(b) home-based therapy with real-time 4D-based feedback 
(c) adaptable for other tele-rehabilitation therapies. 

The results of the project aim to change the current practice of home-based therapy and rehabilitation relating to face-related therapy and rehabilitation. This will be particular helpful for many patients who have difficulties in visiting therapists or hospital.
 
The techniques to be developed in this project are of key interest to facial palsy specialists in the NHS, healthcare industries and patients. The project aims to translate research into clinical practice assisting facial palsy rehabilitation through more effective and convenient technologies. It will accordingly improve the quality of life allowing people to remain active in both working and social contexts. 

Management and treatment of facial palsy will be one of the future challenges for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. A compact and home-based therapy technology will provide a new opportunity for patients to obtain efficient therapy to meet the NHS National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke physiotherapy. Moreover, the proposed work opens up exciting possibilities in home-based 4D sensing and imaging for personal usage especially for healthcare, rehabilitation and therapy. The 4D methods to be developed in this research will be an essential part of tele-rehabilitation. Therefore the research will be of benefit to a large number of clinicians involved in tele-rehabilitation therapies and patients.

2) Impact on imaging areas 

The lightweight 4D sensing and modelling technologies and their application still face challenges. For a sustainable growth of the technologies, it is crucial to enhance cross-disciplinary collaborations and involve more informed researchers. 

This work will provide significant contributions to a variety of imaging industries. As advanced 4D technologies will play increasingly important roles in healthcare and other science and engineering sections, there is a strong need for developing methods for lightweight and easy-to-use 4D imaging and modelling systems. The 4D imaging and modelling technologies provide a new dimension to compensate patient motion, which is a vital consideration in many applications mentioned above. The proposed technologies will provide flexibility for facial animation generation and significantly relieve the burden of quality animation creation through real-time 4D sensing and modelling. The approaches could be further extended and applied to more general applications. Thus, this research will be targeted to improve the state-of-the-art 4D technologies and take these technologies to new applications. 

Apart from the high research value offered by the proposal, the range of the use of 4D facial sensing and modelling technologies in different fields and businesses is considerably broad, which suggests a wide potential commercial application such as gaming, virtual reality, facial therapy and security and so on.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09657FEF-2E9C-422A-A97D-F59E5F847C34</gtr:id><gtr:title>Feature matching for underwater image via superpixel tracking</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/19c26a474e2dea6fb8bf670765ea183b"><gtr:id>19c26a474e2dea6fb8bf670765ea183b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8eeb09d0bbc5.83793641</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>23CE5F44-650E-4BEF-BA2F-6645C9F340CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Underwater image enhancement via extended multi-scale Retinex</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurocomputing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/19c26a474e2dea6fb8bf670765ea183b"><gtr:id>19c26a474e2dea6fb8bf670765ea183b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0925-2312</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8eead391e591.26258068</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N025849/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
