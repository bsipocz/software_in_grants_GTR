This project aims to develop an innovative approach to improve the shelf-life, field-persistence, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of viral biopesticides against the moth caterpillars that damage crops.

Thus, this proposal aims to address a key issue currently facing primary crop production in the UK, Europe and globally - the need for new effective, safe and sustainable pest control. 

In the UK and Europe, environmental concern about the use of chemical pesticides is driving a serious reduction in the number of pest control active ingredients. As a result, the agricultural sector is faced with a real challenge of how to maintain and increase food production with a vastly reduced arsenal of crop protection agents. In the last 20 years, for example, the number of chemical active ingredients allowed in crop protection fell from 1000 to 330, and this is likely to continue, as illustrated by the recent EU neonicotinoid moratorium.

This project seeks to develop novel environmentally-acceptable crop protection products that can replace the lost chemical insecticides and enhance UK and European competitiveness. The biological pesticide formulation proposed here will boost biological pest control, an already rapidly expanding sector of the crop protection market, better enabling biological crop protection products to replace the many de-registered chemicals. Biological pesticides, derived from natural pathogens of insect crop pests, are a publically acceptable group of technologies that could replace chemical pesticides. These are much cheaper to develop than either new chemicals or GM plants, and there has been a rapid growth in the market in the last decade. These biological agents are very specific pathogens of insect pest species, and major meta-studies commissioned by the EU and OECD have identified no adverse environmental issues with groups such as the insect baculoviruses, which we focus on here, and have approved their use in crop protection. However issues of the limited shelf life of current formulations and the short persistence times of the active ingredients once applied to crops restrict their cost effectiveness and discourage wider use by growers even if suitable alternative products to chemical pesticides exist.

The main goal of our study is to develop novel technology to make these biopesticides work better and to be more cost-effective, so promoting their greater use in improving crop protection and food security. By combining the biopesticide active ingredients (baculoviruses) with Entostat waxes, we aim to enhance field efficacy and increase persistence over existing formulations, so reducing the cost of using biopesticides and increasing their attractiveness to users, so making them a more viable replacement for disappearing chemical pesticides. This proof of concept project, by determining that insect viruses can be effectively encapsulated with Entostat waxes and co-formulated with other chemicals such as UV blockers, opens a whole new avenue of research on biopesticide product development that could be applied to improving the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of a wide range of biopesticides both currently used and under development.

Thus, the project has potential impact in: (i) reducing the chemical burden on the landscape, by replacing chemical pesticides with safer biological ones, so protecting ecosystem service provision; (ii) improving the cost-effectiveness of existing biological pesticides, so making crop protection more efficient in terms of labour and other inputs; (iii) through the replacement of banned chemical pesticides with biological agents, it will safeguard a range of agricultural crop systems currently struggling to survive increased pest threats; (iv) enhancing the UK economy by producing a commercial product that, if successful, is likely to generate significant income via licensing agreements and other commercial routes; and (v) expanding the UK commercial pesticide formulation sector into new product ranges.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>89349</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog post for Global Food Security</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>555604D3-E335-41BE-914C-EF7D7FA3422B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The blog was an update of a previous blog I wrote about biopesticides and armyworms in Africa, targeted primarily at interested non-experts.

It is still early days, but so far, we have shown that the new formulation process (combining waxes with the biopesticide) has no negative effects on the biopesticide and so its efficacy is at least comparable with the non-formulated biopesticide. we have also identified two waxes that are both cheap and effective for formulation. The next stage is to determine whether the raw wax enhances its properties or whether we need to include additives in the wax to gain these advantages in terms of storage life and protection from UV radiation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to say (the award is still active)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CF399CCC-32DF-427F-9CD6-7513D390A62C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b99dd5b5fbc5.80054016</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P004970/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C640FECC-44CA-4B72-8D37-BE5E5DC0324C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interaction with organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
