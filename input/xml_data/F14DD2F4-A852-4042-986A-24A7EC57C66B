The network comprises MPAs of international, European and national importance, including new marine conservation zones established under the MCCA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project aims to capture the key social and ecological dimensions of marine conservation law at this turning point by:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>critically assessing the role played by marine conservation law in making the protected seascape resilient&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>looking at the impacts of marine conservation law on the identities and roles of sea users and other stakeholders. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>It is hoped that the project will not only contribute to academic literature in this area but will also make meaningful policy recommendations. Methodologically, desk-based analysis of marine conservation law complements fieldwork in three case study areas in England to compare different realities. In each case study area, participant observation and semi-structured interviews will be conducted with sea users (fishermen, renewable sector and recreational groups), conservation bodies and regulators.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The strategies for disseminating research findings include peer-reviewed publications and academic conferences, a website with reports written in a non-technical language and stakeholder workshops.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?
Stakeholders and policy-makers that are directly involved with designation and/or management of the MPAs network will benefit from this research, namely:
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
UK sea- users (fishermen, renewable sector, recreational groups)
Marine regulators (Maritime Management Organisation and Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authorities)
Statutory nature conservation bodies (SNCBs) (Natural England and Joint Nature Conservation Committee) 
UK-based environmental Charities and NGOs 
UK public at large
European marine policy-makers are also likely to benefit from the project 

How will they benefit? 
The research is directly relevant to UK sea- users since it concerns their lived environment and their identities. It therefore has the potential to contribute to sea users' self-understanding and to their perception of the protected seascape by raising awareness of their role in conserving species and habitats protected by the MPAs network and enabling collective discussions and reflections on these topics during focus groups and workshops. Other key stakeholders, such as DEFRA, regulators and SNCBs will also directly benefit from the research during focus groups, workshops and the final symposium, which will create opportunities to learn about research findings and develop ideas (together with European policy-makers) to increase the effectiveness of marine conservation policy and regulation. These dialogues will be continued well beyond the duration of the project on the online platform created by the project website, whose accessibility is likely to have an impact also on the UK public at large.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>165697</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This short film was made in 2013 with fishermen in the South-East, who consented to be filmed.

a) A paper-under review (the acknowledgement section contains both a reference to the ESRC IAA grant and the ESRC Ecologies and Identities grant)
 b) A succesful application to Bristol for ESRC Impact Acceleration Award. Three different types of impact activities were carried out in April-May 2015:
1)A Stakeholder workshop that took place at the IAMC-CNR Institute on the 30 of April 2015. The stakeholders who participated were very active: they listen with interest and discussed at length the finding of the project and the proposals to improve the management of the MPAs as reported by the PI. One of the proposals consisted in the establishment of a cosultative body to support the management of the MPA whose members include all stakeholders' representatives (modelled along the lines of the IFCAs in England but without statutory powers and duties). Some participants proposed to render participation at all MPAs meetings compulsory for all stakeholders requesting a licence to carry out their activities in the MPA. The Director of the MPA took those proposals on board in order to make them operational and he is looking into funding opportunities at present. 
2) Public meeting:on participation in environmental decision-making took place on the 6th of May 2015 in the offices of the MPA. Participants included the general public, students and representatives of local recreational fisheries associations and NGOs. The meeting was successful as evidenced by the telephone calls and e-mails received by the PI and CO-Is thanking them for the organisation of the event and giving suggestions and recommendations to improve public participation and environmental awareness. 
3)Primary school (fieldwork and lectures with primary school children). The 9 of May 2015 an ecological day was organised by myself (PI) and CO-Is of the ESRC IAA award (Dr. Coppa and Dr. the Lucia, biologists at the IAMC-CNR) and the Director of the local MPA: the pupils were introduced to the MPA regulations and biological resources doing activities in the field. To test the impact of this activity on the pupils' marine conservation knowledge, two tests were given to them: one before the ecological day and one afterwards. In the first test only 15% of the pupils had a good knowledge of the MPA and after the ecological day 79% passed the test. The results of both tests were presented in class and a brief lecture on marine litter delivered on the 29 of May 2015.
4)High School marine education pack (teachers' training short course on the 29th of April 2015 at the IAMC-CNR Institute and development of a pack on marine conservation law and biology to include into the school programme in the current school year 2015-2016. The PI and research CO-I have presented the content of the draft of the marine school pack (to be used in the high school in the school year 2015-2016) to the teachers and discuss it with the teachers to amend the pack to make sure it fitted well with the teaching methods used at the school. A final discussion with the teacher took place on the 11 of September in a meeting at the School itself with teachers and the Co-Is.The pack was approved and it is going to be tested this school year with the students. At the end of the academic year 2015-2016 the feedback will be sent to the PI and Co-Is and it will be possible to do new amendments and extend decide whether to extend the pack to national/regional level.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cda880c1602.25068301-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>My partners at the CNR Oristano set up the interviews and participated in some of them.

We are aiming to publish the result in a journal article (now under Peer Review in Aquatic Conservation marine and freshwater ecosystems). I am the first author and have contributed 70% to the paper. Moreover, this work demonstrated the need for further research and also for impact activities so we applied for a ESRC Impact Accelerator grant at the University of Bristol that we obtained. I was the PI on the ESRC IAA. We carried out the impact research actvities in April-May 2015. The ESRC IAA did cover costs for the impact activities conducted in May-June.

Depending on our expertises, participants were divided in groups and we worked the full day to identify gaps in MMO activities and draw on academic expertise to support the MMO to identify new areas for developing marine management projects.

The discussions carried out tht day were taken on board by the MMO with a view to building innovative research projects and programmes to make best use of government and European funding on science and marine management.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565c2e5386f8b1.82693753</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MCZ workshop in Hastings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7CE0EB63-DFA6-41E5-96F6-B8A206410883</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I attended a workshop in Hastings to discuss the management measures for local MPAs.

The recommendations given by the participants (including me) fed directly into statutory nature conservation bodies and IFCA thinking to develop the most appropriate management measures for Sussex Marine Conservation Zones.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565c2c269b8447.33887595</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Staff seminar at the University of Plymouth</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>85412D87-F6B4-412E-955F-60D1F83F0476</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by Plymouth University to present a paper on my marine research stemming from the ESRC Ecologies and Identities Project in a staff seminar.

The participants said that they learnt a lot from the workshop. After the workshop, participants asked to have the slides of my presentation on conservation law and the booklet regarding community participation in special areas of conservation in Scotland, written by myself and my RA and now available on the project website. 
They also asked to continue being in touch in relation to conservation law and governance of their local Special Area of Conservation and since then I have been on e-mail contact with a couple of them.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cdfc16eb7a2.11995032</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ecologiesandidentities.blogs.ilrt.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation and panel chair at the MARE Conference, Amsterdam</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1003014-9690-4C89-91AF-17D7ACFA6522</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a paper on legal consciousness and conservation in small islands stemming from my ESRC research at the Centre for Maritime Research (MARE), Amsterdam in June 2015.

The symposium was over two days (24-25 September 2015). I invited academic speakers from both the social sciences and natural sciences to consider issues related to Marine Protected Areas within the wider context of marine governance in national and international contexts. Themes such as the relationship between environmental conservation and socio-economics impacts of Marine Protected Areas were discussed through multi-disciplinary lenses, next to key concepts such as &amp;quot;ecological networks&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;ecosystem-based approach&amp;quot;. Case studies from different MPAs were presented to ground the concepts and themes in empirical evidence. I was able to present the findings of my own ESRC Ecologies and Identities project, delivering three presentation and the introductory talk.
Key representatives of the policy community attended the workshop, namely Staututory Nature Coservation Bodies (Natural England and JNCC) and key enviromental NGOs (Greenpeace, Marine Conservation Society). Other attendees were academics from different universities and disciplinary backgrounds.

After the sympsoium, policy participants asked if I could put online all the presentations made and wrote reports back to their organisation to share what they had learnt during the symposium. Therefore, the symposiu fed directly into marine policy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565c26b72ab024.14137387</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ecologiesandidentities.blogs.ilrt.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>7279</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC Impact Acceleration Account</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1ACE4344-05B3-4566-BE63-3DDA37EA40B1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cdcf16e8204.65317786</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The impact of the project has been of a social and cultural nature so far contributing to local and national stakeholders' self-reflexivity and comparative learning in relation to marine conservation zones.
Engagement with different local stakeholders affected or likely to be affected by Marine Conservation Zones has occured thorughout the project through face to face individual meetings but moreoever through stakeholders workshops in selected case studies where the findings of the project have been discussed collectively. Also, a final symposium I organised at the University of Bristol in Sept 2015 has brought together academics and marine stakeholders and regulators, who have been able to collectively discuss the findings of the project and report back to their organisations. 

Policy makers as well as environmental organisations have become aware of my research and in the year 2015-2016 I have been invited by the Office-gov for science to provide input on the future of marine policy in this country (Foresight future of the sea project), by the National Assembly for Wales to participate in a workshop on Brexit and the consequences for environmental and marine issues and by the Blue Marine Foundation to support their work in the creation of a new network of MPAs in the Aeolian Islands. All these activities are ongoing so I am not yet able to talk about the exact impact they will generate but clearly, it is thanks to this ESRC project that my name as an expert in marine policy and conservation law has reached key stakeholders with the possibility to have policy impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5EF05729-E749-430F-8A93-DD75295885C7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb2160ec75d8.24201313</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This interdisciplinary project has critically examined a number of issues related to marine conservation law in the UK from a socio-legal perspective. New knowledge has been generated in relation to: 1)institutions for local marine governance providing a comparison between England and Scotland 2) participative processes in environmental decision-making, developing new theoretical insights also informed by the empirical work, 3) commons governance considering protected areas as a form of new commons, hence developing further the concept of 'new commons', 4) legal consciousness of marine stakeholders in relation to the environment thereby contributing to the socio-legal debates in this area, 5) strengths and weakness of cost-benefit tools such as impact assessments, considering their value in informing environmental policy decisions. 
Using a case study approach, it has been possible to carry in-depth research in 3 diverse areas in the UK (Isles of Scilly, North-West Scotland and South-East England), all affected by the establishment of national and/or European marine protected areas. Through engaging with stakeholders both during the data collection phase and through workshops and a final symposium, collective reflections on marine conservation and the impacts on local sea-users have been made and environmental awareness and local recommendations advanced. The project website has also allowed the project to publicise the research to an international and non-specialist audience.
Collaborations with a number of UK academics have also been developed, leading to joint publications. The project PI has also developed new research networks outside the UK, most notably an on-going collaboration with researchers and stakeholders working in the second largest Marine Protected Area in Italy (Penisola del Sinis-Isola di Mal di Ventre MPA, Sardinia). This collaboration resulted in a successful application for a ESCR Impact Acceleration Account grant where the PI was able to carry out a number of impact activities to improve the governance of Sardinian MPA, also building on the expertise and findings from this ESRC project. Research data and academic papers generated by the project will continue to be made available to a worldwide audience by means of 'open access' publishing and the UK Data Archive where primary data from the project are deposited.
Project publications so far include six peer reviewed papers in both generalist and specialist law journals and in interdisciplinary journals. 
Challenging area: It has been difficult to research in depth the relationship between marine conservation law and climate change in the UK (the third objective in the case for support). One reason is that most of the stakeholders I have been engaged with were primary concerned with getting new Marine Protected Areas designated in the best possible way and there seemed to be little knowledge and concern for issues related to climate change. Also, the governmental decision in 2013 to designate new Marine Conservation Zones in tranches In England means that today we still do not have the full network in place, hindering the ability to assessing network resilience in the face of climate change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings are of interest to other academics working on nature conservation law, fishing and small scale and island communities. The disciplines that will benefit most are environmental law, anthropology, and human geography. The findings can also inform the work and practices of non-academic stakeholders, namely policy makers, statutory nature conservation bodies, environmental NGOs and fishers. Both the academic publications and the data collected and archived in the UK Data Service contain a wealth of information from different perspectives to enable critical reflections on the establishment of new marine protected areas and on the network and also suggest a number of suggested ways forward to enable better decision-making in the future. The findings have already been discussed at the Symposium I organised at the University of Bristol in September 2015 where academic and non-academic participants reflected, inter alia, on the findings of the project and on the way such knowledge could be incorporated in their work. The findings were also discussed with local stakeholders in the workshops I organised in two case study areas, enhancing stakeholders' environmental awareness, and their understandings of different perspectives and of regulatory tools that could help the empowerment of the communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>77F54440-B4BB-4008-85C0-46C16A58D59B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>566580ec7e8441.51078793</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ecologiesandidentities.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A project website has been developed and a twitter account too.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D53E7063-A063-4731-A60E-2A0283CABCF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Both the website and twitter account are dissemination tools aimed at bringing the research to the wider public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ce304691d95.64523494</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Website and social media</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ecologiesandidentities.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>997C6A46-FDA8-420B-BBE5-CEA98774B1AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re-thinking &amp;quot;thin&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;thick&amp;quot; proceduralisation in the context of the designation of Marine Conservation Zones - See more at: http://archive.legalscholars.ac.uk/edinburgh/restricted/paper.cfm?id=297#sthash.PMWZyMPm.dpuf</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>None.
