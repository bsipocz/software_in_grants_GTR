The project also seeks to draw together dispersed or uncatalogued records and testimony relating to these years of activity. A key factor to consider will be how artists over the period have engaged with the public through Tate's learning programmes and how such programmes themselves have responded to social and educational change. This is groundbreaking research in that gallery education, which has a complex history, is currently under-researched and the Tate records and archive provide an exceptional source of well-documented and innovative material. \n\nIn recent years the so called 'educational turn' in art practice, critical theory and museology has elided the worlds of art practice and pedagogy in that many artists or art collectives are engaging in pedagogical practices as art practice. (Examples such as the work of Rainer Ganahl, Andrea Fraser, Tino Seghal, A.C.A.D.E.M.Y. (2008)). Almost in parallel to these art practices, galleries and museums have extended their educational practices and learning programmes to involve varied communities and complex models of engagement. \n\nThe development of these art-pedagogy practices is timely in that it has precipitated an opportunity to take a retrospective review and analysis of educational practices and activities at Tate which have been documented since the late 1960s; to re-evaluate their potential for practice as well as curatorial and learning programmes in the current context. This unique record provides the potential for research into the ways in which artists and their respective practices have engaged with the public through Tate educational programmes. It gives an opportunity to critically evaluate the pedagogical innovations stemming from artistic practices over the years and to consider how these have changed and evolved; to analyse how art practice informed pedagogies within specific historical, social and cultural contexts. In particular it allows for consideration of the effect of artistic practices and their objects upon learning and ways of being as learners within the context of the art museum.\n\nIt is important to register immediately that the term pedagogy in this proposal is NOT restricted to the field of school or university pedagogies but embraces a much wider notion of the facilitation and exploration of learning within communities, in this case, gallery educational practices and their implications for notions of learning communities and communal and creative learning precipitated within and beyond this specific site. \n\nHow has the dialogue between art practice and its pedagogical possibilities within the museum changed over the years? This question draws in a more detailed analysis of subjectivity, practice, creativity, audience and community in relation to art practices and learning...in other words how these have been produced historically and how their relations have formed and evolved. Similarly, examination of the ways in which Tate's artist-led educational practices have negotiated between, and been differentiated from, more formal educational practices throughout the period is afforded here.\n\nThe research will be informed by recent theoretical work onmuseums and galleries as educational sites, participatory practices, the educational turn in art practices, creative learning, performance and objects, critical and emancipatory pedagogies, equality and the politics of learning as well as the hermeneutics of practice and learning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The largest non-academic beneficiary of the project is the general public and the many constituencies and communities with whom the Tate Learning Department engages. Tate reaches out to diverse audiences including families, those in formal eduction, adults with mental health issues and young people leaving care, as well as academics, arts practitioners and theorists from across the world. Tate Learning works collaboratively across the cultural sector, but also works closely with partners in health, social services and education. Innovative learning practice has been a central feature at the four UK sites since the late 1960s. Tate Learning is known for developing new models of practice, which engage with significant numbers (the Tate London sites worked with over 500,000 learners from April 2009 to March 2010, for example). In recognition of its innovative work around inter-generational creative learning, the Gallery has recently been granted Pathfinder Partnership status with Earlyarts, the largest professional development network for people working creatively with children and families in the arts, cultural and early years sectors. This research will make a valuable contribution to understanding learning contexts, processes and outcomes through analysing the kinds of pedagogical relations that have occurred when artists have engaged with different publics. By investigating the practical and intellectual material that comprise artists' engagements it is anticipated that the research will uncover resources of practice that will benefit Tate's continuing work with its different constituencies.\n\nTate is home to the national collection of British art and of modern and contemporary international art. It seeks to makes its wide-ranging collection physically and intellectually accessible to its diverse audiences. Practitioners look to Tate as a model of good practice and Tate is committed to recording and making accessible its archive of education practice to researchers and practitioners. Through analysing the historic development of Tate Learning, sourcing hitherto dispersed records and recording testimonies of previous Learning staff, this project will enhance this archive and support the work of future scholars and of gallery educators in the UK and internationally.\n\nOther outputs will include: presentations at academic seminars at Goldsmiths CAL, Tate and other venues in the UK. Students will present papers at annual conferences in the UK such as British Education Research Association, National Society for Education in Art and Design Research Conference, Museums Association Conference, National Association for Gallery Education (engage) Conference and abroad at National Art Education Association Conference and American Association of Museums annual event in the USA. The student will also be expected to submit articles for national and international academic journals such as iJADE, Studies in Art Education, engage journal, Journal for Education in Museums, the Journal of Aesthetic Education (US), Museums Journal, Journal of Museum Education (US).\n\nIt is planned to hold joint cross-disciplinary seminar/s between Tate and Goldsmiths to explore issues arising from the research project. Both partners are keen to promote research and understanding in the area of art practice learning and community, and envisage this research as a platform for further work with Tate's existing outreach networks and Goldsmiths CAL. This will include engaging critically with other gallery educational programmes to promote enquiry, debate and dissemination in order to develop practices and understanding of the dialogue between art practice and learning in relation to social and community cohesion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024496/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
