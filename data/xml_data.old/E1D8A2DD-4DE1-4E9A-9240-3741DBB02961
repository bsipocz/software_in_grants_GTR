This exclusion can lead to distorted results because the sample used for statistical analysis would not be representative of all statistical units at population level. 

Let us consider the example in which the researcher is interested in estimating the effect of education on wage in a sample of women, accounting for other variables such as experience and age. Here individuals with zero wage are typically excluded from the sample, and because many features of these individuals are likely to differ from those with positive wage, statistical analysis based only on the positive wage individuals will yield biased estimates. Specifically, when not accounting for SSB, as education increases by say 1 unit, wage increases by 1.2 units. If we account for SSB, then the latter value increases to 2.1. The corrected estimate is crucial for policy planning and decision-making in that it can lead, for instance, to larger or smaller investments in education and skills as compared to the case of a biased smaller estimate. 
Additional issues are that the effect of education (as well as experience and age) can exhibit complicated patterns, and that these variables can have a different effect on (i) the probability that the individual has wage different from zero, and on (ii) the magnitude of the wage value for individuals whose wage is greater than zero. In the current example, it is believed, for example, that the effect of education on wage is positive up to a certain level (say 15 years) after which the effect tends to plateau or perhaps decline, and that experience and age have different impacts on (i) and (ii). This piece of information is also crucial in that policies targeting specific categories of individuals can be designed, hence maximising the use of economic resources. 

It is recognized that current methods do not address the issues mentioned above satisfactorily. The aim of this project is to provide the statistical theory, a numerical method and software for semiparametric sample selection modelling, where these issues can be simultaneously and fully dealt with.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of the research beyond academia are many and include:
- Sufferers from HIV. In HIV studies, it is crucial to provide estimates of HIV prevalence with the aim to monitor the development of the HIV epidemic, identify groups at high risk of HIV infection, and assess the need for HIV prevention and treatment.
- Women in the labour market. The issue of estimating the impact of socio-economic determinants on women's wages is crucial to decide the allocation of economic resources supporting, e.g., the process of integration of women in the labour market.
- Environmental engineers. Modelling and simulation of rainfall time series in the presence of covariate effects is very important when considering, e.g., the impacts of climate change upon water resource management and flood risk assessment.
In all examples above, the proposed method will allow for more realistic statistical modelling by taking into account the sample selection issue and presence of complex relationships among variables by which the studies above are affected. By obtaining more realistic estimates, policy planning and decision-making will be facilitated in that more targeted investments in, for example, HIV prevention programs, education and skills, and sea flood protection barriers will be possible, hence maximising the use of economic resources. 

The results of the research will be made available to beneficiaries via the typical academic routes (including publications in high-impact scientific journals, conference presentations and seminars), a straightforward to use, freely available and well documented software, collaborations with the applied research community at UCL as well as with the PI's external collaborators in industry and academia in Italy and UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99723</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>One possible application area of the methods developed is HIV prevalence estimation.

This issue arises in many observational studies (e.g., study of prevention program for high school dropouts, quantification of the effect of family-related factors on foster approval, estimation of HIV prevalence, reject-inference to predict credit quality). The main project findings are: 1. It has been possible to develop reliable and stable algorithms for fitting flexible several variants of the sample selection model; 2. the developments suggested new directions to consider for future research to generalise the models further; 3. the use of the new methods may lead to more accurate policy planning; 4. the availability of the R packages SemiParBIVProbit and SemiParSampleSel has been crucial to disseminate this research so far. 



As mentioned, one possible application area of these methods is HIV prevalence estimation. I have recently started working with researchers from Harward (School of Public Health) who have a strong interest in trying to control for non-random sample selection when estimating the HIV prevalence in several countries; here non-random sample selection plays an important role and correcting for it leads to increased prevalence estimates in certain cases. We believe that our findings will be of some interest to WHO and UNAIDSO, for instance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through freely available software.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A5F6265A-FDB5-45F3-A9C5-A11890E83F52</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3401683572.122532477617486</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>216C5A05-C038-4156-9975-BE1D12794EBA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Copula Regression Spline Sample Selection Models: The
