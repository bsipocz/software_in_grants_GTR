It is clear that individuals differ greatly in the age at which they start to senesce, and how quickly they then deteriorate. For example, a study of 38-year-old humans reported biological ages (i.e. a measure of the intrinsic condition / health of the individual rather than how long they have been alive) that varied from 28 to 61 years. However, why individuals senesce so differently remains unresolved. Indeed, this is one of the biggest unanswered questions in evolutionary biology. This has massive ramifications for health and (our ageing) society, as individuals/populations could reduce exposure to factors that negatively impact senescence so that individuals can live longer healthier lives, not to mention associated implications for animal breeding and conservation (see academic beneficiaries section).

Understanding individual variation in senescence has been hampered by a focus on a limited number of characteristics, insufficient appropriate data to measure the genetic component of senescence, and a paucity of integrated studies in natural populations where environmental factors vary and natural and sexual selection act out. These points are important. Different characteristics (e.g. reproductive ability, immunological defences, physical condition) may senesce differently, and variation in the genetic makeup of individuals may underpin different individual responses. The age of an individual's parents when it was born may also impact upon individual senescence, or reproduction early in life may affect ability to reproduce later in life. Crucially, in natural populations, environmental and social effects will combine to determine the stresses that individuals suffer, influence the expression of genetic variation, and ultimately impact on individual deterioration. Before we can mitigate the effect of deleterious factors we need to understand the relative contribution of these factors on senescence.

We aim to help remedy these shortcomings by investigating the interacting environmental, social, (non-genetic) transgenerational and genetic determinants of individual patterns of senescence in a natural population. We can only now do this because we have a unique long-term data resource from a detailed study of a population of cooperatively breeding Seychelles warblers, Acrocephalus sechellensis. Crucially, this is an isolated island population, which has allowed us to follow all individuals (over many generations) throughout their lives, collect blood samples (thus allowing individual genetic characteristics and intrinsic biomarkers to be measured) and measure concurrent environmental conditions, social experiences and individual characteristics.

We will use these data to measure individual variation in the onset and rate of senescence with unparalleled accuracy. We will quantify the impact of environmental, social, transgenerational (i.e. parental age) and genetic factors, across the genome, on when and how quickly individuals deteriorate with age. We will establish if trade-offs between different individual characteristics, and/or across different parts of an individual's life, determine patterns of senescence and whether there is a genetic basis to this. We will quantify the strength of selection on senescence. Finally, we will determine the overall relative impact that environmental, social, transgenerational and genetic effects have on individual senescence.

This study will not only test many key predictions that will reveal the immediate causes of individual variation in senescence, it will also shed light on the ultimate reasons behind the evolution of senescence. Understanding which factors exacerbate senescence means we can potentially avoid such factors or conditions, which will be directly useful to human/veterinary medicine, society and conservation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research will provide knowledge and understanding of how individuals differ in their senescence and how environmental, social, transgenerational and genetic effects influence this. As well as having a fundamental impact on scientific understanding and progress, our work and the translation of our results, will have potential widespread benefits for a number of groups including:

1. CONSERVATION MANAGERS: Optimise breeding programs of endangered species according to the environmental, social, transgenerational and genetic effects that our research finds impact on senescence negatively. An example is selecting breeding individuals according to their age to reduce transgenerational Lansing effects. Identify specific subpopulations best suited for translocations, e.g. individuals with reduced exposure to deleterious factors to mitigate senescent effects and / or using genomic selection. 

2. THE SEYCHELLES: Stakeholders in Seychelles warbler (SW) conservation will gain a deeper understanding of the biology of the SW and can incorporate the results into plans for a fifth SW translocation. Facilitate public understanding and appreciation of science and conservation and help build capacity in these areas
 
3. ANIMAL BREEDERS: optimize breeding programs according to age and fluctuating environment effects; improve genetic diversity in controlled environments; provide information on the cellular mechanisms of senescence and the use of measures such as telomere length as a bio-marker of stress and senescence.
 
4. GENERAL PUBLIC: provide information on sources of individual variation in senescence rates, particularly how social, environmental, transgenerational and genetic effects can influence senescence. Offer age-appropriate explanations of SW senescence to children with underlying themes promoting both women in science and conservation of biodiversity. Biologists at undergraduate to post-graduate level will gain knowledge of the evolution of senescence.
 
5. MEDICAL AND NON-MEDICAL RESEARCHERS: provide a novel and holistic perspectives to biomedical scientists, demographers and researchers on senescence and help shape future medical research.
 
6. PUBLIC HEALTH POLICYMAKERS: provide information on potential long-term effects in future generations as a result of the increasing age at which individuals have children; guide future health care needs in populations with increasing numbers of senescing individuals; advise fecundity experts on effects of parental age at birth, and early social environment on senescence rates. All these factors will inform policies around healthy ageing.
 
7. PDRA/RA/TECHNICIAN: will gain valuable transferable skills sets that will advance their employability.

Using a combination of use of public/social media, workshops with SW stakeholders, talks at international conferences, an educational children's book, and strategic interactions with key stakeholders involved in setting the ageing research and policy agenda, we will maximise the impact of our research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>504137</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>60073FF8-A8B5-4125-A408-36F38D55BA38</gtr:id><gtr:title>Heritability of telomere variation: it is all about the environment!</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
