Attoseconds and sub-femtoseconds are the natural time scale for multi-electron effects during the ionization and break-up of atoms and molecules. The proposed research will explore the physical mechanisms underlying correlated 
multi-electron dynamics and devising schemes to probe/control these mechanisms. Correlated electron dynamics is of fundamental interest to 
attosecond technology. For instance, an electron extracted from a molecule carries information determining the electronic molecular orbital and 
position of the nuclei, thus paving the way for molecular imaging. Moreover, the proposed work will explore magnetic field and quantum interference 
effects on attosecond processes. These effects are crucial for fully understanding many phenomena, such as the generation of attosecond pulses and 
holography with photoelectrons.

The overall aim of the proposed work is to explore attosecond phenomena, magnetic field and interference effects during multi-electron ionization in atoms and multi-center molecules triggered by ultra-short and ultra-strong near-infrared and mid-infrared laser pulses. The rapid experimental advances place these phenomena at the forefront of Attoscience. New theoretical tools are urgently needed to address the challenges facing this field. In response to this quest, I offer novel, efficient and sophisticated semi-classical methods that are much faster than quantum-mechanical ones and that allow for significant insights into the physical mechanisms. These semi-classical techniques are appropriate for ionization processes through long-range Coulomb forces. Using these techniques, I will address some of the most fundamental problems facing Attoscience. My objectives are:

1) Account for non-dipole effects to explore photon momentum sharing between electrons and ions in two-electron atoms and diatomic molecules driven by near-IR and mid-IR laser pulses.
3) Account for non-dipole and interference effects to explore &amp;quot;frustrated&amp;quot; ionization and non-sequential double ionization in two-electron atoms and diatomic molecules 
driven by mid-IR laser pulses.
4) Explore non-sequential and &amp;quot;frustrated&amp;quot; ionization in two- and three-electron three-center molecules driven by near-IR laser pulses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed work is on exploring attosecond phenomena, magnetic field and interference effects during the ionization of multi-electron
atoms and molecules driven by ultra-intense near-infrared and mid-infrared laser pulses. Understanding the electronic motion on an attosecond time-scale in atomic and
molecular systems will be of importance in the future for a number of industries that closely work with applied researchers in order to enhance the industries' capabilities. 
My research will be communicated to these applied researchers through academic dissemination and also through direct interaction with them at the London Center for Nanotechnology (LCN). LCN aims to provide the nanoscience and nanotechnology needed to solve major problems in information processing, health care, and energy and environment. In the sense mentioned above, my research will contribute in addressing problems in economy, health care and information processing.

Specifically, one of the goals of the proposed research is to explain magnetic field effects in strong-field phenomena and in particular photon momentum sharing in atoms and molecules. The combined momenta of the photons can give rise to radiation pressure which has significant applications in the generation of terahertz radiation. 
There is a fast growing interest in terahertz radiation. The reason is that it has a wide range of applications, such as manufacturing, inspection of packaged goods and remote sensing. Terahertz radiation is also non-ionizing and thus it can not damage DNA making terahertz radiation safe for medical imaging.

Moreover, one of the goals of the proposed research is to understand and control the attosecond electronic motion in molecules. Controlling electron motion in molecules
and solid state structures opens up the way for researching technologies that may lead to speeding up current electronics by several orders of magnitude.
Namely, the density of information flow, such as operations performed by a computer, is determined by how fast the electron current can be switched on and off in a 
digital chip. The current state-of-the-art in electronic circuits dictates a switching time within a fraction of a nanosecond. To achieve higher density of information, faster switching times need to be achieved, such as attoseconds. The latter is the natural time-scale for electronic motion in neighboring atoms in a crystal lattice or in a small molecule.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>336664</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F9674A0-51D1-412D-8D4C-413C82748BD3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Frustrated double and single ionization in a two-electron triatomic molecule H</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11e591749d9e03d48c9eff836f040718"><gtr:id>11e591749d9e03d48c9eff836f040718</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0953-4075</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bda9d47f84d3.31396909</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7E216FFD-CFBC-4889-9219-E91B67291E4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Frustrated double ionization in two-electron triatomic molecules</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11e591749d9e03d48c9eff836f040718"><gtr:id>11e591749d9e03d48c9eff836f040718</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2469-9926</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bdaa2a864345.04147210</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N031326/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9CD2DA3B-F052-4076-95ED-10F46E76C382</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optics, photonics &amp; lasers</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3730AA1C-F09A-4945-8874-DEF6237C50CD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lasers &amp; Optics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8ECC9D35-20DE-4F19-8A8A-07D65859D6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Light-Matter Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>22E04520-28AA-48BA-9263-1CFE1B162D16</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Quantum Optics &amp; Information</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>66CEB256-1CFB-4A2B-A588-3AC25D4D3FB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Scattering &amp; Spectroscopy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
