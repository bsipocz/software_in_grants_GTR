The pattern of recessive inheritance implies that babies who inherit two copies of a mutant gene (from both parents) will have a serious blood disorder, needing long term treatment and care; while carriers who inherit only one copy will not have the disease. A much higher incidence poses significant healthcare challenges in low and middle income countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa and India. India is estimated to have the largest number of carriers of IBD in the world, around 42-45 million; where approximately 22,500- 37,000 babies with IBD are born each year. A significant proportion are born in households with little or no access to healthcare, especially in the rural, poor, marginalised ethnic and 'tribal' communities. Despite cheap diagnostic tests and treatments, including curative stem cell transplants, available across public and private sectors, only 5-10 percent of children receive optimal care in India. There is little research examining the social and ethical reverberations of carrier screening, especially of pregnant women, and the use of prenatal diagnosis and termination of affected foetuses, as preventive interventions as a means of 'prevention'. Further, it is imperative to examine how, given the widespread practice of sex selective abortions and poorly regulated markets, an appropriation of genetic technologies by state, public as well as private enterprise might further exacerbate existing structural inequalities related to ethnicity, caste, gender and disability. 

This 40 month long, Indian case-study will provide a comprehensive analysis of the social and ethical reverberations of policies and practices surrounding the treatment and 'prevention' of IBD, within the context of globalisation and the promise of genomics in reducing health inequities in the global South. The main aim of our research is to relate these global debates to local forms of engagement and therapeutic citizenship reflected in the practices of NGOs helping people (potentially) affected by these disorders in the rural, poor and marginalised communities. To contextualise our empirical work, we will first review literature from medical anthropology, sociology, global health policy and ethics to help refine the questions to be explored through a multi-sited ethnography. Fieldwork across four sites will involve main actor interviews, shadowing NGOs, community focus group discussions and practitioner interviews, as well as in-depth interviews with patients, carriers and two main carers in 80 households, from rural/semi urban poor areas and 10 households from a higher socio-economic, urban background. These households will be visited three times over 12-14 months. Researchers will use a topic guide for interviews on how IBD are recognised and treated, and decisions related to risk and long term care, and maintain health diaries for each family with a record of illnesses, health expenses and decisions related to health. 
 
The research will provide theoretical insights from medical anthropology/ sociology/ bioethics and the empirical findings to inform policy and practice on the far reaching social and ethical ramifications of the use of genomic technologies as a means of 'prevention' of recessive gene disorders in particular, and the intersections between genetics, ethnicity/ 'race', gender, kinship, disability and citizenship at a broader level across South Asia. Further, the project will provide methodological insights into a model of community engagement, where the local users and community organisations are intrinsic to the conception and execution of the research as well as the recommendations based on the research, to ensure that they have a stake and benefit from the dissemination plan.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>To maximise impact of the research, we will use a multi-pronged dissemination strategy - including workshops, focus groups, written summaries/ posters in local languages, newspaper articles, a summary of findings and recommendations for policymakers and healthcare practitioners, as well as peer reviewed journal articles and conference presentations for academic and policy audiences. To ensure that the local community participants and NGOs can benefit from dissemination, extensive consultations with local stakeholders is an important feature of this plan. The applicants' previous experience and longstanding commitment to addressing health inequalities broadly and social implications of sickle cell and thalassaemia in particular have generated trans-national collaborative relationships that will ensure wider dissemination. The three main stakeholder groups that can benefit from our findings and community engagement are: the NGOs, the families and marginalised ethnic communities affected by IBD and the focus of public health intervention, and policy makers and healthcare practitioners and research organisations at local, national and international levels. 

Our collaborators, SCS India and PRAYAS will be involved in the research from the beginning and help us with dissemination. The NGOs can benefit by increasing their capacity to utilise the findings and engaging directly with the ethically contentious issues posed by (lack of) particular health interventions at a local level. We will facilitate links with other research networks in the UK, Nepal, Nigeria and Brazil. Hence, successful models of NGO-state- practitioner engagement can be shared across (often competing) sickle cell and thalassaemia communities as well as in other health areas across South Asia. A successful legal campaign led by SCS India for allowing students with sickle cell anaemia extra time in Board examination is a good example. Four workshops have been arranged to discuss the main findings and potential policy and practice recommendations, and how to translating a summary of our findings and recommendations into the vernacular using written and/or alternate formats/posters, signposting useful services and contacts. These can be used by community members as well as healthcare practitioners for seeking/providing information about IBDs and services (village, district, state). Local intellectuals and academics will be involved in highlighting IBD in vernacular press, local radio and television channels. 

Second, four community focus groups have been planned with the help of the NGOs to discuss the findings and recommendations with local stakeholders, including younger and older men and women, potentially affected by IBD as well as family carers. The findings will be discussed in an accessible local language to ensure that local priorities are reflected in the recommendations to be incorporated into our final written summary for policy and practice. 

In order to provide a resource for policy and healthcare practitioners, a summary of main findings and recommendations will be written and disseminated at a national seminar in Delhi, where the major stakeholders in public health policy and practice at national and international levels will be invited. ISERDD, Prayas and AJ have extensive links with several health organisations ensuring widest possible, electronic distribution of this summary. A link to the English and vernacular summaries will be accessible on the research website.

Finally, an international seminar at Sussex will discuss the theoretical, methodological and policy contributions from the research. Our links with CGHH, York, will help engage with the WHO on current resolution on 'prevention and management of birth defects'. The academic and policy issues will be disseminated through publishing in a broad range of peer reviewed journals, and the monograph aimed at social scientists, clinicians as well policymakers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>527838</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community Focus Group Discussion, Gadchiroli, Maharashtra</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECC143AB-FB9F-4C7F-9BF3-C66422B6F4BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>With the help of our local NGO collaborator (Arogyadham) in Kurkheda, Gadchiroli district, Maharashtra, a focus group discussion was conducted by two members of the research team (SC and RS). The main objective of holding the group was to get a cross section of 10-12 participants from different religious and socio-economic backgrounds (caste- tribe) that may or may not have known someone with sickle cell or thalassaemia; to find out what they knew and/or thought about these disorders . However, instead 24 participants ranging from three head teachers of the local colleges, President and three members of the local Women's Welfare Association, a chemist, village council head (panchayat), a clinician, healthcare assistant , as well as parents, children and a couple of young adult patients attended the session. The discussion was moderated by SC ad RS in Hindi, with simultaneous translation into Marathi by a Research Assistant from the Sickle Cell Society India. We had provided a leaflet in Marathi explaining the research and the purpose of the focus group to be handed out to the participants in advance. This leaflet was first written in English, translated into Hindi by ISERDD and then into Marathi with the help of SCS India, to ensure the clarity of language and local context. The Arogyadham team members contacted potential participants by telephone and also sent a written invitation in Marathi along with the information leaflet. 
Contrary to our original plan, the presence of parents/carers as well as four children and adult patients meant that we had to divide the time so that we could discuss general issues of health within the community (keeping the four children entertained) before moving on to more specific issues that the carers and patients might have wanted to raise. We had to improvise the ground rules to moderate the animated discussion, especially since the Marathi speaking translator had a tendency to take over. Interestingly, the gender division is not marked in this part of Gadchiroli, though the women and men sat in separate rows. The caste divide was quite visible, with the upper caste men and 'respectable members' of the community sitting in the front row, and those from Adivasi and scheduled castes taking the back rows. An initial attempt at arranging the chairs in circular rows did not work since we had twice the number of people on the day. 
The Topics discussed were:
i) Health in the community in general (women's health; men's health; children's health) 
ii) Knowledge about sickle cell and thalassaemia (cause, symptoms, 
iii) Treatment, prevention and issues of caring
iv) The role of government and related agencies in improving care for patients and affected families 

There was a general consensus in the front row, that upper caste/ more educated and well off families are more secretive about sickle cell in the family. They often seek treatment in the private sector and you might get to know about such an illness only following death in a family. This was in reference to a recent death in the neighbourhood of a man in his 40s who had died of sickle cell. During the second half, the parents and adult patients raised several concerns related to lack of access to blood transfusion locally; access to education and employment. They also were keen to find out more about sickle cell and treatment etc. SC explained that we can only put them in touch with relevant organisations. Sampat Ramteke, President SCS India held a separate session with this group, once the refreshments were served and the focus group discussion had been concluded.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c25a24b3f572.15420877</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/research/public-health/projects/inherited-blood-disorders-indian-case-study/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>3rd Global Congress on Sickle Cell Disease, Bhubaneswar, India</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>441AB14B-9073-4AAE-93AB-5CF2709DD606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the largest international conference on sickle cell (and inherited blood) disorders organised by the Global Sickle Cell Disease Network, hosted in Orrisa, India, this year. Apart from the scientific sessions on epidemiology, diagnosis and treatments from different parts of the world, including India and parts of Africa, the sessions also brought together a number of small and not so small NGOs working in the field of inherited blood disorders. As part of the fieldwork, I was shadowing Sickle Cell Society, India (Nagpur). They had to engage in prolonged negotiations with the organisers to allow them to take more than 50 young patients and carers, largely from the rural and poor areas of Maharashtra, who could not afford the delegate fee. Following protracted negotiations, the President succeeded in seeking part registration without the normal fee for these delegates. This was the only user contingent represented and they had an opportunity to interact with some of the leading clinicians who held small group sessions, as well as the policymakers and state Department of Health officials. The conference also provided an opportunity for these young people to travel outside their town/ village and meet other young people affected by sickle cell, and discuss the wider issues of acting as a unified pressure group to 'fight for their rights'. 

The conference also provided an opportunity for networking and I met up with a Yale student and local clinician from the Tharu region of Nepal, who are trying to set up a sickle cell service with the government of Nepal, and keen to learn from the work of NGOs in India. I have had a preliminary discussion with a view to facilitating a workshop of these different groups in India, towards the end of 2017, to facilitate exchange and capacity building. This will contribute to building long term working relationships for maximising impact on policy and practice, and exploring efficient models of state-NGO-market relationships across state and national borders.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c266cf3492e9.07547094</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FCE07CF3-4E8E-43A7-BB3C-9F35E347AC5E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inherited blood disorders, genetic risk and global public health: framing 'birth defects' as preventable in India.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Anthropology &amp; medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7340a3de4f41ff2349881c9575a2ae31"><gtr:id>7340a3de4f41ff2349881c9575a2ae31</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chattoo S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1364-8470</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aaa2d61407655.54997864</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N015665/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E2F513B-B936-4DF8-B28D-0ADC57F8BFC7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropological Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC4405D9-8A0D-41F9-B71A-A19C9CD0AEFA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnicity</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2093C2F8-C10A-40EE-A71D-387F3BA92968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Kinship Health &amp; relatedness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
