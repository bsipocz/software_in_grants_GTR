The discussion is to be broadcast through the regional radio stations and possibly television to a more general audience who will be given the opportunity to participate as well. At the time of writing, the confirmed panellists are: Prof Richard Dawkins (Evolutionary Biology); Dr Tim Lenton (Climate Change); Prof Ruud ter Meulen (Bioethics), Prof Robert Winston (Reproductive Medicine), and we are in the process of recruiting experts in the field of energy production.b) Keynote presentations given by leading experts, all Fellows of the Royal Society, in diverse areas of science, engineering and technology: Prof Michael Kelly FRS FREng (Engineering); Prof Peter Sadler FRS (Bio-inorganic Chemistry); Prof Roger Cashmore FRS (Particle Physics &amp;amp; Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford); Prof Andrew Fabian FRS (Astrophysics); Prof Linda Partridge CBE FRS (Ageing); Prof Cheryll Tickle CBE FRS FRSE (Developmental Biology).c) Students will give verbal keynote presentations based on their own experimental work. In the circulars to all schools and colleges at the beginning of the academic year 2006, students will be asked to submit an abstract of their intended verbal presentations - inner-city state school participants will be particularly encouraged.d) Students will be invited to give poster presentations via the response based on the circulars sent to schools and colleges at the beginning of the academic year 2006. Poster presentations will be particularly geared towards the application of scientific discoveries and their future impact on society. e) Universities will present their leading edge research findings in the form of posters, displays, and hands-on activities such as interactive exhibits with the key researchers manning the stalls so that they are able to discuss their work with the delegates and enthuse them as a result.f) Extensive information will be available for opportunities to study science, engineering and technology-based degrees and the prospects these degrees offer for employment in the related fields. The key personnel involved in careers advice will be available to pursue any queries raised by the delegates.g) Written resources will be available through the Showcase Science website and through mailshots through schools and colleges.h) The event will be advertised through all learned scientific bodies, eg, IOP, IOB, RSC, RS, ASE, BA, etc.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-08-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31781</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E033474/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
