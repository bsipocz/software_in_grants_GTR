It addresses clear knowledge gaps identified by NERC, DEFRA and UKERC in the effects of MREDs on flow conditions, habitats and ecological interactions. It will use a wealth of observation techniques above and under water, ranging from radar to sonar and in situ measurements, to be deployed over 2 years at 3 key sites around the UK. These measurements will feed into models of ecological interactions and habitat preferences, allowing predictions of the multiple effects of large MRED arrays.
Being fully cross-disciplinary, this project will engage different academic beneficiaries at each stage. Researchers in the field of instrument design (in the laboratory and at sea) will benefit from our experience in building the different systems and adapting them to long-term deployments on the seabed, in extremely challenging environments. This will be done by carefully planned Knowledge Exchange activities and open-access publication of our results, as well as exchange of personnel. The avenues opened for continuous imaging of complex and dynamic 3-D structures will be useful to researchers in other fields associated with ecological systems and marine structures, but also in medical 4-D imaging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>See lead proposal.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164040</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with University of Exeter (Renewable Energy group)</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE7D6451-92FE-42FB-B73F-34D5EEA5C4C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Merchant, N.D., M.J.

Several students expressed higher interest in renewable-energy issues. One of them has now started a NERC-GW4+ studentship that I co-supervise with my collaborators at the University of Exeter.

We have successfully deployed and recovered the FLOWBEC platform in the challenging waters of Orkney (Scotland), for 5 deployments of 2 weeks each in 2012 and 2013. We have measured the environments around two tidal turbines, one wave-energy converter and two control sites with no MRE structures.

Our findings are now being used by other stakeholders, providing direct economic impact. A Knowledge Transfer Partnership, spearheaded by the University of Aberdeen (co-PI on FLOWBEC) and including the National Oceanography Centre - Liverpool (PI on FLOWBEC) and the University of Bath (co-PI on FLOWBEC), has recently been signed with MeyGen, with funding from InnovateUK.

The approach and methodology developed in the NERC FLOWBEC project are now considered by North American instrument developers as &amp;quot;examples of good practice&amp;quot;, and capitalised on by exchange of personnel and information.

Providing a complete tool to assess the environmental and ecological impacts of Marine Renewable Energy structures, our project is de-risking the siting of tidal turbines and wind energy converters, making the demonstration of their value and economic interest easier, and therefore aiding in the development of marine renewable energies at the UK, European and international levels.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DAD5D096-00E2-4D79-83A0-092F2C40184F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54623781b978f9.01610965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) is an integral part of the commitment to reduce CO2 emissions and use more sustainable sources of energy. But how clean are these new energies? How do they affect the environment? Through the FLOWBEC-4D project, we have designed a new series of instruments and a methodology to analyse measurements, which we validated over 5 deployments at different sites with and without MRE structures.

(1) We have designed and developed an acoustic imaging system, integrated into a subsea platform (the FLOWBEC platform). The 4-tonne frame hosts instruments to image the seabed and water column and its environmental conditions. The frame can be deployed fast (20 minutes in 40 metres of water) to account for rapidly changing tides or sea conditions/ The FLOWBEC system can take measurements up to 8 times per second over 2 weeks, catching details of a few centimetres to a range of 50 m.

(2) We have successfully deployed and recovered the FLOWBEC platform in the challenging waters of Orkney (Scotland), for 5 deployments of 2 weeks each in 2012 and 2013. We have measured the environments around two tidal turbines, one wave-energy converter and two control sites with no MRE structures. Deployments were conducted during the seabird breeding season which peaks in summer months, assessing the interactions between seabirds, fish and marine mammals. For multibeam imagery alone, several Terabytes of data cover ranges of 50 m from the sonar, encompassing the MRE structure (if any), the seabed, the water surface and any object within range, all imaged 7 times a second for 2 weeks.

(3) Algorithms for noise removal, target detection and tracking have been written. It is possible to estimate collision risk and the impact of the turbine structure on tracked targets by considering the vertical distribution of targets and what percentage are likely to encounter the turbine structure. Tracking analyses allow the environmental effect of MRE devices to be explored using the distribution of targets (plankton, fish, birds, marine mammals) and predator-prey interactions with time, tide and space, where space includes vertical use of the water column, and horizontal distribution around the wave and tidal sites, and how this changes with the presence and absence of structures. The vertical habitat preferences of these ecological groups and collision risks can also be evaluated by looking at spatial overlap with MREDs, and collision risk predicted by looking at the overlap with conditions favoured for siting of future MRE structures. These results have been presented in a series of open-access articles, sharing and disseminating the knowledge worldwide.

(4) Early dialogue between engineers, scientists and end-users has resulted in a tool (the FLOWBEC platform) and a methodology (data acquisition, target detection and tracking) which can be applied to any MRE structure around the world. This approach can also be used to check the environmental and ecological impacts of any other offshore structure. This is now further developed through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with MeyGen, a marine-renewable company, in collaboration with the University of Aberdeen and the National Oceanography Centre.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings can be taken forward in three ways:
- Technologically, the design of an acoustic imaging subsea platform and its successful deployment in the challenging environments of the European Marine Energy Centre have shown the hardware and software strategies that could be used by similar instruments all around the world. This is now explored through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with MeyGen, led by the University of Aberdeen and with the University of Bath and the National Oceanography Centre in Liverpool as associate academic partners.
- Scientifically, our results show for the first time, in a quantitative and repeatable manner, that it is possible to acoustically detect and follow marine life in complex environments around marine renewable energy structures. This is now taken forward by marine ecologists, comparing measurements from 5 deployments in different settings with population models. Publications with the University of Aberdeen are now being written to develop these different results.
- In terms of Marine Renewable Energy, the results from our project show it is possible to quantify accurately impacts of different devices and settings, and de-risk the trial and installation of different MRE structures.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B5B83049-488B-4371-AC1D-5A1D5CB8E261</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462350d0d55b9.51909111</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philippe_Blondel</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>British Standards (BSI) &amp;quot;Underwater Acoustics&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D831952F-CFD9-4B5D-8D5F-2FB72140F2FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Partly due to my involvement with the acoustic part of the FLOWBEC project, I was invited to join British Standards BSI committee EH/1/7 &amp;quot;Underwater acoustics&amp;quot;.
