Larger body size reduces the risk of being consumed by predators, and can also lead to an increase in the number of offspring that an animal is able to produce. Despite these apparent benefits of increased body size, mounting evidence suggests that most organisms do not grow at the maximum rates that are physiologically possible, and that there may actually be significant costs associated with rapid growth. Compensatory growth (the rapid growth which occurs in many organisms after a period of food deprivation) provides a useful means to study these potential costs, and in fish, individuals that have undergone a period of growth compensation tend to display reduced swimming performance later in life. While such a cost could have an important influence on both survival and reproductive success, the underlying mechanism responsible for this trade-off between compensatory growth and impaired swimming ability is not understood. There is also nothing known about individual variation in the compensatory growth response in fishes, and the extent to which the costs may differ between individuals. Overall, our lack of knowledge makes it impossible to accurately predict the consequences of compensatory growth for the survival and reproductive success of individual fish, and its effects on the dynamics of wild fish populations. Such information would be valuable, especially considering the increased likelihood of fluctuations in food availability due to factors such as climate change. The proposed research will examine muscle fibre structure, biochemistry, metabolism, and swim performance in individual fish to gain insights into the mechanisms responsible for the trade-off between growth rate and swim performance. Additional laboratory studies will be performed to examine the influence of predator presence on individual variation in the growth response, and also to study the consequences of compensatory growth for individual risk-taking behaviour and reproductive success. Finally, theoretical studies utilizing individual-based mathematical models will compliment these laboratory experiments by incorporating empirically-derived estimates of variability to investigate the implications of variation in growth rate for individual fitness. Overall, this interdisciplinary study will allow us to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of the costs of rapid growth in fish, and also the consequences of this trade-off for behavioural and evolutionary ecology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280956</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Research Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ecophysiology and Predator-Prey Interactions of Mediterranean Fishes</gtr:description><gtr:id>E201EF10-1E51-4985-92AB-8E6E5165857D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Marras, S.*, Killen, S.S.*, Lindstrom, J., McKenzie, D.J, Steffensen, J.F., Domenici, P.

1) To identify mechanisms responsible for the reduction in swim performance following a period of growth compensation. Severe parasitic infections present in the three-spine sticklebacks that were used in the first year of the fellowship lead to very small samples sizes for studies conducted during this time and necessitated a change to minnows as the study species the following season. These latter studies examining changes in the swim performance of growth manipulated minnows revealed several differences in aspects of swim performance not previously examined. These included differences in maximal sustainable swim speed and the speed at which fish display a gait transition from only steady swimming to the inclusion of burst-type swimming. Correspondingly, fish having undergone compensatory growth also showed reductions in aerobic scope, although anaerobic capacity appears to be unaffected by early nutrition and compensatory growth. Samples for histological and biochemical analyses of muscle fibre structure have been collected but are still awaiting analyses due to the compressed timeline stemming from difficulties during year one, and knock-on effects for the final two years of the project.
2) To quantify individual variation in compensatory growth and the extent to which it is costly. After a period of food deprivation, fish displayed wide variability in the degree of growth compensation exhibited - some fish grew very rapidly while other did not differ substantially from control individuals. There was evidence that the degree of growth compensation is dependent on the amount of mass loss during food deprivation, which in turn may be affected by baseline metabolic demand. Interestingly, however, fish that lose the largest amounts of mass during food deprivation actually showed little growth compensation, probably because they exceeded a physiological threshold beyond which their ability to recover is limited. The existence of these nuanced growth responses in relation to starvation tolerance and metabolic demand represent a major advance in our understanding of how fish of various phenotypes may respond to aspects of resource availability and environmental change.
3) To investigate the consequences of the trade-off between compensatory growth and swim performance for individual fitness. This project examined the consequences of compensatory growth on a wide range of behaviours that are not only relevant to the biology of stream dwelling fishes such as minnows but also to other animal taxa. Results from this project demonstrate that early food-deprivation and subsequent compensatory growth has long term effects on behavioural traits such as boldness, activity, and sociality, with animals having undergone compensatory growth generally displaying degrees of these behaviours which might allow them to feed more but that would also increase their risk of being killed by predators. The fellowship also included the first examination of the metabolic response to alarm substance in fishes, with growth compensated fish showing a decoupling of the physiological and behavioural responses to this cue as compared to controls. Growth compensated fish also displayed a preference for cooler temperatures, which likely acts to reduce their maintenance costs to allow an excess of energy for growth.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main beneficiaries of this project are other scientists working in the fields of physiological and behavioural ecology, and life history theory. Studying the costs of compensatory growth provides vital knowledge in these areas, especially considering that growing anthropogenic influence on the environment could cause increased fluctuations in resource availability and a greater preponderance of compensatory growth among wild fish populations. It should also be noted that the phenomenon of compensatory growth has long been of interest to the aquaculture industry, as it provides a means of manipulating growth trajectories and also homogenizing the sizes of individuals to be stocked in common holding tanks. However, the use of compensatory growth may have the potential to impact the flesh quality of cultured fishes if there are effects on muscle fibre structure. This fellowship included an examination of the effects of compensatory growth on muscle fibre structure, and could therefore provide insight in this area and be of benefit to the rapidly growing field of aquaculture.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8A9B1B0A-0360-4A51-9A98-7D51A9B9222F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546117419297b2.75109937</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C17E4070-F4DA-40C1-9522-865168D745D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Growth trajectory influences temperature preference in fish through an effect on metabolic rate.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of animal ecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/efdf99d4f2bf99e6e04508a66c2d55d3"><gtr:id>efdf99d4f2bf99e6e04508a66c2d55d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Killen SS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-8790</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5460bc41e2dbd3.95905910</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0BD13E66-2129-4F06-B099-012EBAC8262D</gtr:id><gtr:title>What causes intraspecific variation in resting metabolic rate and what are its ecological consequences?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings.
