Further, the rise of online social networks such as Facebook has allowed for a new source of information to be exploited by recommendation systems: the user social network. 
Internet access is now becoming increasingly mobile and smart phones are changing the way people interact with places and with each other in an increasingly complex manner. Smart phones are starting to impact the way users access information on the go and receive suggestions. More specifically, innovative recommender systems are currently being developed to exploit GPS-based or other location-sensitive information, associated on-the-go to individual users through smartphones. This second generation of recommender systems, by being location-based, pose an entirely different set of problems which not only have to do with the knowledge of the user (her or his &amp;quot;profile&amp;quot;), but also with that of the places. Knowledge of places can be achieved by means of guides, textbooks and journey reports, or by direct experience. These ways are quite different in nature. The former is globally accessible (everybody can get it from afar) and relatively fast to obtain, especially in the age of the Internet. The latter is only locally accessible (one needs to be in the place to access it) and, being generated by those living in the place through personal local interaction, it becomes accessible only after long-term interactions and the construction of personal relationship of mutual trust. When visiting a new place, you would necessarily rely only on global information to navigate the place and access its resources. Conversely, if you are a local, your knowledge of the place is mostly constructed through your personal long-term exchange with what all your neighbors are doing every day and with their favorite places in the neighborhood; as a result, you not only would rely on local knowledge, but you would also contribute - by interacting locally - to the formation and continuous re-shaping of the information used by your neighbors too in their interaction. If we name the long-term, locally generated knowledge of the place &amp;quot;neighborhood knowledge&amp;quot;, we can say that what people locally do in places is in one way or another dependent on the extent to which they have access to the neighborhood knowledge.
The second generation of recommender systems allows &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; place-users, i.e. people visiting a place who are not experienced with the place itself, to access &amp;quot;globally&amp;quot; available information. However, a good deal of information is still not exploited in these systems, as the geographic and the social only &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; in a superficial way: in other words, the system does not take advantage of any information about the particular use of the place that local &amp;quot;communities&amp;quot; have done in the past and do &amp;quot;at the moment&amp;quot;. 
As neighborhood knowledge information is now becoming increasingly available through the viral expansion of location-based social networks such as foursquare or Gowalla, it is now possible to explore a third generation of recommender systems, where knowledge about how the place had been used in the past (historical use) or is used at the moment of the inquiry (real-time use) by communities of users is the key element of the system. The main motivation behind the GALE project is to pioneer such third generation recommender systems which would make it possible for the rapidly growing population of &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; city users to access a level of information, that of the neighborhoods knowledge, which is inherently inaccessible to global repositories, and to do that in real time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Joint research with University of Cambridge</gtr:description><gtr:id>69255FD6-E38A-4C32-98A7-BB39121274D6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d849f6b9d84a14-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>University of Strathclyde researchers worked on this project with researchers from University of Cambridge</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen Mary University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Joint research with Queen Mary University of London</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B04DE23-C564-4E03-9B4E-AAA836352362</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d8892ab9d88948-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>University of Strathclyde researchers worked on this project with researchers from Queen Mary University of London</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The basic concept behind the GALE project is that neighborhood are relational formations that are fluid in space and time, as opposed to fixed. GALE findings demonstrate that through the case study of London. This concept is the building block of the theory of Plot Based Urbanism (PBU) in Urban Design, according to which cities that continuously change in time like adaptive complex systems can (and should) nevertheless be masterplanned; however, our way of masterplanning cities must change to acknowledge the fluid nature of cities. The PBU approach to masterplanning is gaining momentum as we speak. In this context, the Sheffield City Council has decided to utilize a PBU approach to masterplan the important area of Castlegate right at the core of the historical city. After a first meeting held in Sheffield on Dec 4th 2015 with Simon Ogden and the Sheffield City Regeneration Team, we have been invited to contribute to the organization and delivery of a kick off conference to be held after summer 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D8F579C0-2957-49D6-BAC4-A2266F42CADB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df1668b32405.88334642</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Neighborhoods have always been seen by planners as fixed geographical entities, i.e. circles fo r=400mts around a centre of retail and services. The &amp;quot;Neighborhood Unit&amp;quot;, an early XXth Cent. concept, is such fixed geographic entity, and the backbone model fo urban design since inception and up to our days. Our findings demonstrate that this model is not accurate as it does not reflect the &amp;quot;fluid&amp;quot; nature of social relationships in the current &amp;quot;liquid modernity&amp;quot;. However, it turns out that the relationship of urban communities with urban places is not determined by urban spatial features (such as the location services and retail), but at the same time is not completely independent by them. Somewhere in-between spatial determinism and spatial irrelevance, urban communities in their continuous floating and re-shaping do generate spatial patterns that are in fact influenced by the location of retail and services.
Moreover, if we define communities as &amp;quot;groups of interests&amp;quot; that are defined according to a specific profile of place attendance, we observe that while communities may remain stable in time, a large majority of their users change (around 70% of turnover in the three-months time period).
This, plus a number of other more specific findings, has profound implications for urban designers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Planners may base on our findings a deep revision of their approach to future sustainable cities, where their plans would, rather than focusing on static images of a desirable future, turn into the preparation of the conditions (spatial, political, economic and decisional) for the urban system to self-ecover in time.
Urban economics may focus more on local development as trigger to regeneration in ways that emphasize the role of retail and the main street economy over &amp;quot;by-capital&amp;quot; gentrification.
Urban sociology may look at gentrification in different ways, by emphasizing the positive role of fine-scale bottom-up local change over large-scale &amp;quot;cataclysmic&amp;quot; interventions, provided that adequate policies to back-up the low-end tier of the original population are devised and implemented.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>39143D57-9C37-4771-A258-13EEC68000FE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df1b0121fd26.49675011</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Raw check-in records are cleaned and organised with careful and special concerns about their metadata on both geographic and temporal aspects.
