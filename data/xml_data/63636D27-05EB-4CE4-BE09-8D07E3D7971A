These populations have arisen through rapid medical progress in tandem with changes in social attitudes to issues surrounding disability and chronic illness.This has led to increasing numbers of people with rare and/or complex disease or disability living considerably longer lives than was historically possible. Many are pioneers; facing issues as they age that have never before been encountered, either by themselves or by professionals leading their treatment and care.&lt;br />&lt;br />One such new ageing population is the first cohort of paediatric liver transplant recipients in the world. Childhood liver transplantation began in the early-mid 1980s in Britain and North America.Thirty years later, many of the British pioneers, still receiving specialist care, are living adult lives. While clinical outcomes are documented, social and ontological issues for these adults, who have lived their whole lives within the context of their body as a project, have never been studied. Through in-depth interviews with transplant recipients and clinicians, we aim to explore both the health and social implications of living with transplanted livers from infancy and wider existential questions surrounding such transforming ?experimental? surgery.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>134772</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>NHS Choices</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>NHS Choices: Childhood Liver Transplant</gtr:description><gtr:id>6A0AA704-1105-4BE9-B1A6-B556D73BBDE7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b957f044b957f062-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>We worked with NHS Choices Video to produce a series of short films for their website about growing up and growing older after a childhood liver transplant.

I submitted written evidence focusing on adults with congenital or rare syndrome-related liver disease, a significant and growing part of society for whom the experience, treatment and care of what has become for them a long-term condition has become paramount. I highlighted the paucity of evidence to clarify the extent to which existing adult health and social services will have capacity to meet future demand. This group are not currently included in any national long-term care strategies, which situate health and social care issues within populations who typically acquire long term conditions at older ages, or, in the case of liver disease, situate the problem in the context of entirely preventable factors, thus potentially serving to further marginalise their treatment and care.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7514379674.1165042b2ffc90</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hepctrust.org.uk/Resources/HepC%20New/Documents/APPHG%20report%20March%202014%20FINAL%201.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>King's College London: A 'New' Ageing Population</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>22E601C1-DC2C-404F-B7F3-952B139F50D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We called on politicians to review the cost of prescriptions for liver transplant recipients, who must take daily immunosuppressants to prevent organ rejection for the rest of their lives.

This is based on the notion that there is no longer one 'normal' way to appear (in terms of the body) or to be (in terms of behaviour and activities across the lifecourse). We trust this is reassuring to future recipients who may feel pressured to achieve a typical way of being post-surgery.
Our findings have also been used by NHS Choices in the context of short videos on their website for current and potential future recipients of liver transplant (and indeed other organ transplant recipients). Parents making decisions for their children to be put forward for assessment and listed for transplant may also find these videos useful as they address the process of growing into adulthood with a transplant received in childhood. There is little facility to find out how well these videos are received, other than a brief star rating option. However, from the site we do know that the first video has been watched over 4,600 times, with the video focusing on the transplant scar being watched around 1,300 times.
A feature in the Daily Telegraph focusing on the study and thee now-adult recipients of childhood liver transplant (January 2014) led to a similar feature piece being published two months later in the Daily Mail 'I'm 41 but my liver is just turning 30'. These have been helpful in highlighting for the lay public the issue of both organ donation need and the increasing longevity of transplant recipients. More recently, a feature piece in Cosmopolitan magazine, a publication aimed at young women in their twenties and thirties, focused on the liver transplant scar and body image after surgery through an article on one of the early transplant recipient. We are pleased that the article, 'I've got a large scar but I've never wanted to hide it - I'll happily walk around in a bikini on the beach', adds another perspective to debates around how young women's bodies are depicted in the media and body image more generally. 
We are aware that one of our study participants has accepted a role as an advocate for a charity that aims to encourage people to register as organ donors via various awareness campaigns.
The study has fed into a wider body of research around the 'new' ageing populations; groups of people growing older with complex health conditions with which they historically would not have survived childhood. This research has been cited in the Health Select Committee's inquiry into the management of long term conditions (LTC), and it has now been acknowledged that the definition of LTC needs to be revisited to encompass the complexity of contemporary health conditions. The study and its findings are also used in teaching postgraduates in the Department of Social Science, Health &amp;amp; Medicine at King's College London (Designing Qualitative Research Methods for Social Science and Health; Researching Vulnerable Populations).
On a more individual level, we understand that many of our study participants, who reported feeling very isolated in not knowing another now-adult childhood liver transplant recipient, continue to provide support and friendship to each other via a closed Facebook group set up by them during the study period.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F957F9FF-1FCA-4D61-9F08-D8842A626190</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54be84c06949b5.12701735</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The success of recent medical innovations has influenced greatly both child and adult identities, not only through creating a future of survivorship for many groups that historically did not survive for long after their diagnosis but also through the creation of bodily differences and experiences which act as important signifiers for social identity. 

Children who undergo liver transplantation in early life are one example of a group that has been profoundly transformed through medical innovation; we collectively term these groups 'new' ageing populations. Until now, social scientists have focused on how transplantation changes adults' lives, neglecting this experience for the growing number of children who also undergo this procedure. We were interested to learn about the experiences of the UK's first cohort of childhood liver transplant recipients, who at the time of their interviews had lived for 20-30 years with a donor organ. These children as 'future adults' are unique in that they have no template on which to base their experiences and expectations. These individuals have never existed before, either as children with a future or as now-adult survivors of childhood transplant. Broadly, society has had little occasion to react to or interact with these children in everyday life.

In particular we wanted to understand these recipients' experiences of growing up before and after surgery, and what role their body, with a large surgical scar and marks from other clinical procedures, played in how they saw themselves and how others reacted to them. For all children and young adults issues connected to the body can be crucial in dealing with the contexts of what is 'normal' and what is different; this is all the more so for the participants we interviewed for this study. 

We found the social context of the child was extremely important in influencing their self- and social identities. At home, parents appeared to shape their child's identity through controlling tightly a medical regime focused on the concept of their body as a machine. Parents celebrated their survival as a transplant recipient, yet at the same time socialised their child as a 'normal' child, albeit one who had a serious illness. The hospital appeared instrumental in shaping parents' focus on their child's body as a machine that could be 'fixed' by prioritising bodily function over appearance and enabling parents to emulate a medical way of thinking. It also gave reassurance to children through their meeting other 'different' young patients who were just like them. 

At school, prolonged absences meant it was difficult for these recipients to make or sustain friendships. When returning to school, participants reported being identified by their peers as a 'sick' child, and having to work hard in trying to re-join friendship groups that had developed both their educational and social learning in their absence. Nearly all our participants reported being teased or bullied, despite this not being a specific area of our questioning. Primary school was generally reported as a more unpleasant environment than secondary school for constructing a positive identity, as the physical marks of liver disease or transplant were more evident and participants had few resources on which to draw in explaining their difference. What appeared to help foster and protect a 'normal' identity was being known first to other schoolchildren as a friend, fellow student, or healthy child, before needing time away from school or being noticed for bodily differences. In this context, friends' reactions to, for example, the new transplant scar, were positive and influenced strongly participants' own attitudes towards it.

The unspoken societal assumption behind transplantation was that having saved the child through medical innovation they would be able to go back to a 'normal' life that would be relatively similar to that of their peers. However, we found that it is crucial to understand that there is no 'normal' life to be resumed. In recognising this, it could be that this group might be much more than purely a pioneer cohort of those who underwent organ transplantation. It may also be that they are living the much more unpredictable lives of young people interacting in a much more reflexive society where assumptions about what ageing has become are much more provisional.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This group of now-adult survivors of childhood liver transplant is just one example of many groups that constitute 'new' ageing populations - those now growing into adulthood and later life due to the impact of significant medical innovation and changes in societal attitudes towards those born with health impairments. Our findings demonstrate how the concepts of 'normal' health and 'normal' life have been challenged through the difference and diversity that this group experience as they grow up, both in their appearance and in how they experience everyday life. In many cases there is no 'normal' life that can be returned to or achieved following organ transplant, although this is not to suggest that a 'different' life is of any less value or enjoyment. This has implications for the language clinicians and other healthcare professionals use to discuss the outcome of this intervention with patients and/or their parents; for example the extent to which clinicians can claim a 'normal' life can be resumed post surgery.

We were surprised at the number of accounts of teasing and bullying that these now-adult survivors had experienced, particularly at primary school, especially as this was a topic we had not set out to investigate. Although these accounts are historic, occurring 20-30 years ago, use of social media in contemporary society might now exacerbate rather than ameliorate this problem. We do not have evidence to make any claims about what children currently undergoing organ transplant experience but suggest that teachers be aware of the potential for bullying and teasing in this context.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ADBC2826-77D9-4F28-A202-43A9A263D0F7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546232c4805041.20805542</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FB7277B1-2741-4AB6-A334-3C48CA0B166C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Moral Obligations and Expectations of Adult Survivors of Childhood Liver Transplant: Deserving or Undeserving Recipients?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e2da7b4e5a6fecbc801f57f49c4da8b"><gtr:id>4e2da7b4e5a6fecbc801f57f49c4da8b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Karen Lowton (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_8253503327cb6494e4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7E85D809-9227-4A6E-B42F-2D93F5D5CFCE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Family Survival Strategies and Network Solidarity in the Context of Children Needing Liver Transplants</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e2da7b4e5a6fecbc801f57f49c4da8b"><gtr:id>4e2da7b4e5a6fecbc801f57f49c4da8b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Karen Lowton (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2033560917cb648ff8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>56058C65-E8BD-45AA-8005-281D79539E4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constructing embodied identity in a 'new' ageing population: A qualitative study of the pioneer cohort of childhood liver transplant recipients in the UK.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social science &amp;
