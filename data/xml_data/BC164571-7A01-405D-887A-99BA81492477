Broadly, we group the activities of the centre in research themes that concern:

i) Security Analysis and System Verification covering High Assurance Software, Static and Dynamic Analysis of Products and Systems, Software Engineering Techniques, Provable Security, and Formal Methods

ii) Operational Systems and Information Assurance covering Access Control, Privacy, Intrusion and Anomaly Detection, Intrusion Tolerance Techniques, Data Centric Security, Recovery Techniques, Real-Time Situational Awareness, Trust and Risk, and Key management.

The themes are applied in a variety of contexts, from embedded sensing systems such as body area networks for healthcare, through infrastructure monitoring, unmanned autonomous systems, operating systems, middleware and large scale distributed systems architectures to web-based and cloud computing environments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this project will be in terms of:

a) promoting the Centre's capability and research achievements to a large number of industry and government organisations thereby increasing the adoption of the latest research results towards the design and engineering of secure software systems. 

b) enhancing the research agenda of the the Centre by enabling new collaborations and bringing the latest practical challenges from the broader cyber security efforts to the attention of researchers within the Centre. 

c) improving research results towards more comprehensive cyber security solutions by leveraging complementarity and enhancing collaborations with other centres of excellence. 

d) improving better communication and understanding of the cyber security challenges to a broader audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award recognises Imperial Colleges' standing as an Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research. It has enabled to bring together much of the research within Imperial College relevant to cybersecurity and to engage with key stakeholders across government and industry in this area. This grant led to a number of further awards including the leading role Imperial College plays in the Research Institutes in Advanced Program Analysis and Verification, and Trustworthy Industrial Control Systems, our participation in the PETRAS IoT Research Hub as well as individual research projects with financial support from a variety of organisations including EPSRC, EU, Defence and Industry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See relevant research projects.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8380632B-604F-4B5A-9244-7C39DA057768</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd797c2a95a4.06808933</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K00414X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
