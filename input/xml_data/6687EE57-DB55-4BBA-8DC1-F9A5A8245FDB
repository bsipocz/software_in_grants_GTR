Three Minute Learning is a social enterprise set up to engage young people with science and to improve literacy. We propose to extend beyond the classroom and to new audiences the use of our free online resource 3ml. Developed originally to help overcome poor readers' learning disadvantages, 3ml has been shown, by external evaluation, to interest and inspire all school pupils with cutting-edge science. The majority of 3ml content is aimed at upper primary and lower secondary school pupils. It has been used by pupils as young as 8, and we are currently working to make it more accessible to these younger children.

The combination built into 3ml of short, readable science articles with activities that improve understanding, literacy and recall is unique. 3ml has been very well received in schools. During development, several thousand pupils have used it, generating considerable enthusiasm among teachers. Providing feedback on a workshop we delivered to teachers at the invitation of the Scottish Schools Education Research Centre (SSERC), Head of Physics Gregor Steele said: &amp;quot;3ml has been exceptionally well received in its own right, let alone for a session that did not involve experimental work.&amp;quot;

We propose to concentrate, in this project, on schools in areas of disadvantage, on looked-after and adopted children, and on those with additional support needs. We will strengthen features of 3ml that help children who struggle. We will enhance the story library with stories aimed at younger children.

We propose to develop a new library within 3ml, specifically about STFC sites around the UK and to ensure that the stories we write are used, in particular, by schoolchildren in the age group 8 to 13, with a focus on children who struggle with schoolwork. More accomplished pupils will also find plenty to interest them in the rich variety of articles we will create on STFC sites, people, science and engineering.

We propose to spend one to three days - depending on site personnel time and availability - at each UK STFC Laboratory. While exploring the science and engineering, we will attempt to cover as wide a range of roles as possible, for inclusion in the Careers section of 3ml. We will create an STFC anthology of stories on each laboratory and the people who work there. 

Content will be designed to hold children's interest, rather than directly serve the curriculum, although curriculum tags on each story will enable teachers to find those relevant to the topic they are teaching at any time. Using our contacts in schools, we will work through heads of departments, pastoral care and special needs teachers to get the STFC stories used both in and out of school.

Some features from social media and computer games are already built into 3ml. These have proven popular with children unused to success, as points are gained for engagement as much as for achievement. We will enhance and develop these features.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have been working closely for several years with Gregor Steele, Head of Physics at the Scottish Schools Education Research Centre, with whom we recently agreed that 3ml would be free to all schools that are members of SSERC. On their part SSERC will now publicise 3ml throughout their network, share their experience of delivering online CPD with us, and support our use of their facilities and equipment to run 3ml teacher workshops.

We will use our learning during these CPD sessions to shape the further roll-out of 3ml. We will discuss further developments with contacts and colleagues in meetings and at education conferences. We will raise awareness of the project through public engagement networks, by attending education events and offering programme presentations.

Three Minute Learning works closely with the ASE and IoP Teacher Networks. We will discuss links with their CPD support programmes and presentations at SSERC summer schools and IoP conferences. We will offer to write articles for the STEM Learning and STEM Ambassadors communications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R006075/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
