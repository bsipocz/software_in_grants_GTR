I intend to redress that balance by writing a sequence of poems that explores the idea of the city. Do men and women experience or write about city space in the same way? Critic Peter Barry has suggested that male poets are not only more likely to write about cities but also more likely to name specific places as if they are confident in their ownership of city space, whereas women poets tend to have a vaguer and less specific way of writing that indicates a lack of ownership and confidence. It is, of course, dangerous to generalise about 'men' and 'women', and my research will look at what these categories mean in relation to ideas about city space. \n\nI will, however, investigate a claim by the geographer Gillian Rose that our thinking about space is influenced by a male-dominated tradition that sees the world as a clearly-mapped subject of knowledge. In order to make it clear, paradoxes and difficulties are ignored. These paradoxical spaces, she argues, are vital for describing women's experiences. It may be, then, that women are writing poetry that is refusing to take ownership of the city but by doing so are responding more fully to an increasingly complex view of city space. I will explore this issue in my own creative work and also in the work of contemporary women poets who are dealing with similar ideas, particularly Lisa Robertson, Alice Notley and Denise Riley.\n\nIt may seem unusual to be carrying out research on the city in Bangor, which is a very small city surrounded by countryside. However, it is an ideal place to explore some paradoxes and changes in the concept of the city. I would argue that the idea of the city is changing, particularly in Wales. Bangor is no longer a province of the UK but, since devolution, a focal point for north Wales and its relationships with the rest of the world. As an English-born writer in Wales I know that in some senses I am living in a foreign city, and that this is increasingly the case across Europe, where cities often provide a focus for movement between countries and languages. In an age of global capitalism it is difficult to say where the city itself begins and ends. The city used to be a centre of trade and commerce but transport, the internet and out-of-town shopping centres have changed our view of urban space. In some ways, all of us in the West are part of the city. Poetry needs to find a new way of responding to this situation and it cannot fall back on nostalgia for the certainty that places, whether urban or rural, used to offer us. \n\nWhen I use the English language I am part of global relationships, so how can poetry in English respond to the city as a specific location? I will be developing this idea in my own poems and I will collaborate with poets elsewhere to explore the different ways in which poetry can relate to urban space.\n\nAs a way of understanding the relationship between language, the body and space, I will be making some investigations through my writing and performance. One of these will be to make audio and video recordings of places that I can use in conjunction with my poems in performance. They will not illustrate the poems but will be a way of questioning how I experience urban spaces as a woman through the body and in language.\n\nThis research will lead to a clearer view of what the city is coming to mean, particularly for women, and it will help to create ways of writing poetry and discussing it that are relevant to an increasingly urbanized experience of life.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>132496</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'These are mesmerising and unsettling poems.

These vibrant, multi-layered poems create a textual city of monuments, castles, bridges and labyrinths through which the reader is invited to wander. Such visions carry within them both hints of utopia and the seeds of disaster, as the future city is haunted by its ruins.

New relationships emerge from the fractures of a shared past and the global communications of the twenty-first century. The historic traumas of European cityscapes emerge in dream and nightmare, but also in the process of rebuilding 'as the vein runs / under fragile reconstructions / of what was holding us together'. As well as testing the notion of the city as a collective identity, these poems present the urban landscape as open to what lies beyond it.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B519AA3B-262A-4129-B06A-D527BA4DB734</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poems from this collection have been translated into 18 languages and performed at poetry festivals all over the world.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54622d0b9346c0.37722089</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Remains of a Future City</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The disappearing sounds of Zo&amp;euml; Skoulding's new collection may be either in the rich sonic environments that the poems observe, or in the resonance of words themselves, which exist in traces of speech and breath.

'The Man in the Moone' takes its title from a 17th century work of science fiction in which lunar inhabitants can communicate their thoughts via music alone. But rather than aspiring to reach beyond language, these poems focus on the spaces that words occupy, looking at how 'a sentence reverses itself between two pairs of eyes' or noting 'the distance drifted by a word shaken loose from border controls'.

Skoulding's characteristically inventive approach to form emerges in a fractured sonnet sequence based on the coincidences of room numbers. Repeated actions build haunting interior spaces which the reader is invited to enter, each poem becoming a room in which sound 'bounces off four walls', as memory accumulates in the subtle rhythms of everyday life.

These poems can provoke states of eerie unease, or of passion evoked with shimmering densities of verbal texture. We can feel the ice in 'Gwydyr Forest' &amp;quot;Freezing under feathered/ water landscapes&amp;quot;. Provisional landscapes in which the ground itself is 'aslant' call for an active state of perception in which 'I can do more dangerous things /just with my eyes'.

Such readings in other countries often have far greater cultural impact than they do in the UK because they happen on a larger scale. In Nicaragua (2010) and Venezuela (2011), for example, Dr Skoulding read at events with audiences of thousands as well as extensive coverage in the national press. Because of her wide international experience she was a leading contributor to a programme for Radio 4, Guns, Roses and Poetry Readings, aired in 2011, explaining to UK listeners why poetry is seen as so important in other cultures.

While the first workshops of Metropoetica in Krakow and Ljubljana were planned with Literature Across Frontiers as part of Dr Skoulding's AHRC project, subsequent events were commissioned by literary festivals in Riga, Wroclaw and Athens, where the group was invited to create performances to reflect an understanding of a particular city through poetry, film and photography and present it to a local non-specialist audience. These invitations show that the project's impact in generating a new approach to artistic practice and literary interaction between minority languages. Dr Alexandra B&amp;uuml;chler, LAF's director, writes that Metropoetica 'had a profound impact on our practice with respect to the translation of poetry in the context of gender-related inquiries on the one hand and community cultural development on the other. The project engaged both the participants and local communities in the cities where the project took place in thinking about their environment and about life in urban environments in general. 'She adds that Dr Skoulding's 'approach to connecting writing and translating poetry about cities from a gendered perspective has provided useful insights for other projects.' The Wroclaw event received extensive coverage in the Polish media. Work from the project is publicized via a website at and an international co-publication in book form, Metropoetica listed under Publications.

Dr Skoulding worked with UK, Indian, Swiss and French poets in December 2010 on a co-translation and performance project in Chennai, Pune and Trivandrum, India, organized jointly by Literature Across Frontiers and the British Council. Follow-up multilingual performances took place in Bangor and at the high-profile Ledbury Poetry Festival in June 2011, showing how the combination of translation and multimedia performance in Dr Skoulding's previous work has informed further cross-cultural engagements.

The projects outlined above have generated ways of understanding the role of English as a 'bridge' language in poetry translation and performance; English is decentralized and placed in relation to other languages, while the process in itself is made a creative focus rather than a neutral transaction. This approach addresses the literary cultural heritage of Wales, which is split between two languages, and has provided new models for cultural interaction. The first North Wales International Poetry Festival, directed by Dr Skoulding, took place in October 2012. Nine visiting international poets gave readings alongside Welsh writers in both languages with a focus on the role of translation and performance in the local bilingual context. Performances took place in empty shops and small businesses in Bangor High Street, including a recital in Welsh by local schoolchildren, contributing to current initiatives to regenerate the town through artistic and community engagement. Encompassing experimental work by highly regarded international practitioners in several languages as well as Wales's historic strict-metre traditions, the festival transcended the binary linguistic oppositions that often limit cultural exchange. The curation of the festival as a multilingual event with site-specific and cross-media elements was drawn from Dr Skoulding's research in Metropoetica. The event was the first of its kind in Wales and over 300 people attended, mainly in Bangor but also in Aberystwyth and Mold. Dr Skoulding's application for Arts Council of Wales funding for a second festival in 2013 was successful, indicating support for the project at a national level.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9D32D211-4060-4C8B-87D6-4433A3A8B647</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5462299f8dc239.45667680</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My critical research has developed from my creative practice as a poet and is closely related to it. I see writing and performance as a means of discovering and rethinking the ways in which place and identity are constructed and experienced, rather than simply as an outcome or recording of such knowledge. Much of my work has centred on how place shapes and is shaped by language. Although I write in English, the nature of Bangor as a bilingual city has been an important influence, as have the layered histories of other European cities.

As a development of the ideas in my 2008 collection of poems Remains of a Future City, I have become interested in how language and subjectivity in contemporary poetry and poetics, particularly that written by women, relate to urban spaces. Research carried out during my AHRC Fellowship was focused on connections between feminist poetics and geography. It involved the following questions: why have women poets tended to write about the city less often, or less directly, than men? What is the role of gender in the construction of city space? How far does the globalized city give rise to paradoxical relationships with language, culture and political structures, and how might these be relevant to women writers? My critical monograph examining these issues was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2013.

Working alone and with others, I perform poetry with field recordings and electronic music as an exploration of relationships between language and the physical environment. These performances have taken place all over the world, but they are concerned with how language, sound and noise interact in particular localities. 

My research has shown that poetry provides new ways to consider relationships between the city and the subject, and that language may be considered not just as a means of representation but as part of the sensed environment of social space. Thinking of language in this way enables new responses to place and new forms of artistic collaboration.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My work contributes to debates about gender and poetry that have become particularly important in the last two years. My focus on sound also contributes to the current interest in interfaces between literature and sound studies. Literature organizations such as Literature Across Frontiers have already noted the value of my practice-based research in terms of their own programming of international performances and workshops.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B6E7E481-F3CD-4AF6-990A-699F753A990D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54622bad306742.82531400</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bangor.ac.uk/english/staff/skoulding.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Metropoetica was a project in which creative practice, performance and translation were linked to create site-specific performances.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F26C75DA-9000-45F9-9C27-2902109719F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>While the first workshops of Metropoetica in Krakow and Ljubljana were planned with Literature Across Frontiers as part of Dr Skoulding's AHRC project, subsequent events were commissioned by literary festivals in Riga, Wroclaw and Athens, where the group was invited to create performances to reflect an understanding of a particular city through poetry, film and photography and present it to a local non-specialist audience. These invitations show that the project's impact in generating a new approach to artistic practice and literary interaction between minority languages. Dr Alexandra B&amp;uuml;chler, LAF's director, writes that Metropoetica 'had a profound impact on our practice with respect to the translation of poetry in the context of gender-related inquiries on the one hand and community cultural development on the other. The project engaged both the participants and local communities in the cities where the project took place in thinking about their environment and about life in urban environments in general. She adds that Dr Skoulding's 'approach to connecting writing and translating poetry about cities from a gendered perspective has provided useful insights for other projects.' The Wroclaw event received extensive coverage in the Polish media. Work from the project is publicized via a website and an international co-publication in book form.

Dr Skoulding worked with UK, Indian, Swiss and French poets in December 2010 on a co-translation and performance project in Chennai, Pune and Trivandrum, India, organized jointly by Literature Across Frontiers and the British Council. Follow-up multilingual performances took place in Bangor and at the high-profile Ledbury Poetry Festival in June 2011, showing how the combination of translation and multimedia performance in Dr Skoulding's previous work has informed further cross-cultural engagements.

The projects outlined above have generated ways of understanding the role of English as a 'bridge' language in poetry translation and performance; English is decentralized and placed in relation to other languages, while the process in itself is made a creative focus rather than a neutral transaction. This approach addresses the literary cultural heritage of Wales, which is split between two languages, and has provided new models for cultural interaction. The first North Wales International Poetry Festival, directed by Dr Skoulding, took place in October 2012. Nine visiting international poets gave readings alongside Welsh writers in both languages with a focus on the role of translation and performance in the local bilingual context. Performances took place in empty shops and small businesses in Bangor High Street, including a recital in Welsh by local schoolchildren, contributing to current initiatives to regenerate the town through artistic and community engagement. Encompassing experimental work by highly regarded international practitioners in several languages as well as Wales's historic strict-metre traditions, the festival transcended the binary linguistic oppositions that often limit cultural exchange. The curation of the festival as a multilingual event with site-specific and cross-media elements was drawn from Dr Skoulding's research in Metropoetica. The event was the first of its kind in Wales and over 300 people attended, mainly in Bangor but also in Aberystwyth and Mold. Dr Skoulding's application for Arts Council of Wales funding for a second festival in 2013 was successful, indicating support for the project at a national level.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621cfaa8d6b2.77616221</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Innovations in translation as creative
