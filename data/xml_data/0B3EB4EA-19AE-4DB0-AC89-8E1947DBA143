One theory is that such people are dogged by a perverse desire to verify their negative identities, aimed at preserving intrapsychic coherence and retaining interpersonal predictability/control. Some empirical evidence supports this theory. For example, people with negative self-views choose critical over flattering feedback when given the choice. Yet such evidence remains equivocal: credibility judgments alone may explain such choices, as people with negative identities may deem only critical feedback worthy of consideration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A mixture of laboratory-based and applied research seeks to definitively settle the question. Using both open-ended and close-ended measures, it explores the reasons people give for choosing between positive and negative feedback concerning their identities, both global and specific. It also tests whether such choices and reasons vary as a function of experimental manipulations of predictability/control. In another paradigm, people?s reactions to the prospect of losing or gaining identity features are systematically explored.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, the research examines whether the feedback choices of medical patients and the long-term unemployed reflect verification strivings or credibility judgments. The overall goal is to understand how people might best overcome barriers to positive identity change.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Identity matters. Unlike other animals, human beings contemplate who they are; evaluate themselves favourably or unfavourably; aspire to be the same or different; and then act to realise or reject the identities they envisage (8,22,24). Moreover, identity matters at different levels: individual, interpersonal, and collective (43). Individually, a positive identity is key to subjective well-being (6): low self-esteem and depression handicap otherwise gifted people. Moreover, specific identities (cultural, academic) predict performance above and beyond ability (13,35,46). Interpersonally, having one's relational identity positively affirmed (37) is a source of relationship intimacy and satisfaction (12); indeed, representations of self and close others are often partly conflated (3). Collectively, large-scale conflicts invariably involve group identity becoming hyper-salient (1,49), but can also facilitate collective self-sacrifice (56). Furthermore, identity can both shape widespread economic preferences, and even create unique externalities (2). 

If (a) identity matters in all such instances, and (b) some identities prove more adaptive than others, then it becomes important to pin down, at a fundamental level, what mix of motives underlies identity stability and change. Indeed, in an increasing fractious world, where growing migration (18) obliges mutual accommodations of cultural roles, and where global booms and busts create occupational as well as financial uncertainty (26), understanding the dynamics of identity transformation is a psychological imperative. In elucidating them, our findings will serve to guide and empower policy-makers keen to overcome barriers to adaptive identity change-in the first instance, vis-&amp;agrave;-vis troubled individuals (depression), users of public medical services (hypochondria), and members of disadvantaged communities (chronic unemployment).

For example, if a desire to maintain the coherence of identity, above and beyond its positiviy and plausibility, really were a significant factor in maintaining depression and low self-esteem, then techniques aimed at bolstering self-worth, and emphasizing the reasons why self-worth was justified, would need to be supplemented by techniques that provide reassurance that, if identity changes, the interpersonal world remain intelligible, predictable, and controllable. Such a finding would be of great relevance to the therapeutic community. Similarly, if a desire to verify a long-time identity as an invalid existed, that would shed new light upon hypochondria, and provide physicians in primary care with avenues for dealing with it, such as by reassuring patients that their established roles and relationships were secure. Such an approach would thereby assist in the economical and optimal use of scarce medical resources. Finally, if chronic unemployment is in part caused by a motivated reluctance to abandon a picture of oneself as a recipient of welfare, and such psychological roots were among the factors effectively addressed by social workers and job creation agencies, then greater economic productivity might ensue.

Ultimately, we plan to communicate the findings of our research to non-academic audiences in four ways: (1) by engaging directly with the communities we study; (2) by liaising at a local level with academics who deal with depression, hypochondria, and long-term unemployment, and embracing University-sponsored opportunities to get the message out; (3) by liaising at a national level with organizations dealing with depression, hypochondria, and long-term unemployment to the get the message out; and (4) by developing a bespoke website the purposes of which is to make our findings easily and comprehensively accessible to any interested party.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>257311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have communicated to members of the public about our findings on identity by such various means, including radio.

Why do people with negative identities (e.g., low self-esteem or depression) tend to choose negative over positive feedback (i.e., criticism rather than praise)? What explains this potential barrier to identity change?

TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS:
One theory, self-verification theory (SVT), claims that people with negative identities do so because they want to. That is, even though they also want to embrace a positive identity, they ultimately prefer to embrace their existing identity, because gives them a satisfying sense that their world is predictable, controllable, and coherent. 

A rival theory, raison oblige theory (ROT), claims that people with negative identities indeed seek to have a positive identity, but find themselves reluctantly obliged to believe negative feedback and disbelieve positive feedback. 

We conducted research to help decide between these leading theoretical possibilities.

BACKGROUND:
Previous studies had found that people with negative identities, relative to positive ones, more often opt for negative feedback over positive feedback, when they have to choose between them. We replicated this finding (albeit consistently only for feedback based on a personality test). We also consistently replicated the finding that judgments of feedback accuracy largely match people's identities. Both SVT and ROT alike predicted these findings.

1: However, SVT implies that people with negative identities should, on balance, want negative feedback to be true, and positive feedback to be false. We found that this was not the case. Instead, people with positive and negative identities alike wanted positive feedback to be true, and negative feedback to be false. 

KEY FINDING #1: People with negative identities do not aspire to be someone whom negative feedback describes.

2: We also found that, when given the choice of getting some feedback versus no feedback from a clinical report, people opt for feedback more often than not-regardless of whether their feedback, or their identities, is positive or negative. All else equal, people generally want detailed information about themselves. That said, when the source of the feedback is a person, another finding emerged: people prefer to interact with other people who see them positively. Either way, the results contradict SVT.

KEY FINDING #2: People with negative identities do not consistently choose interaction partners who validate their identity. In addition, feedback is evidently valued for reasons other than identity validation.

3: In prior research, positive and negative feedback have always been equally credible. However, when we made the positive feedback more credible than negative feedback, the feedback choices of people with negative identities came to resemble those of people with positive identities. Given ample reason to believe it, people with negative identities will opt for positive feedback. This result strengthens ROT's claim that credibility, not any motive to self-verify, is a key determinant of feedback choice.

KEY FINDING #3: Making positive feedback credible to people with negative self-views eliminates their tendency to make identity-confirming feedback choices. 

4: Some previous research on SVT has assumed that, when people judge feedback matching their identity to be more accurate than feedback mismatching their identity, they do so simply because they are motivated to believe their identities are verified. We showed, however, that feedback judgments are rooted in reality as well as being motivated by identity-related concerns. Hence, accuracy judgments provide at least as much evidence for ROT as they do for SVT.

KEY FINDING #4: Judgments of feedback accuracy, previously assumed to reflect only a motivation to verify identity, also demonstrably reflect the appreciation of personal reality. 

5: According to SVT, people with negative identities opt for negative feedback because they are threatened by identity change. However, when we asked people to imagine identity change, the prospect of either losing a very negative self-aspect, or of gaining a very positive self-aspect, did not disrupt anticipated levels of predictability, control, and coherence. On the contrary, it reinforced them. Only the prospect of either losing a very positive self-aspect, or of gaining a very negative self-aspect, was disruptive. Hence, when it comes to envisaging future identities, it is not identity preservation that reassures and identity change that disrupts, but the positivity or negativity of the anticipated result the matters.

KEY FINDING #5: The prospect of gaining a positive identity aspect, or of losing a negative identity aspect, does not undermine a sense of predictability, controllability, or coherence will be disrupted, so fear of such disruption is not a barrier to identity change.

6: As regard self-aspects that people spontaneously reported were part of their identity, people showed little evidence of attachment to negative self-aspects. Overwhelmingly, they did not want negative self-aspects to be true of them, and they wanted to change them. This was true cross-culturally. In addition, people rarely reported wanting to verify aspects of their identity that were negative.

KEY FINDING #6: People only want to keep, and want to be true, the positive aspects of their identity; they want to discard, and prefer to be false, the negative ones.

BOTTOM LINE:
We asked: what matters when it comes to facilitating positive identity change? 

Collectively, our findings suggested that the explanation is not that people with negative identities want to preserve those identities on balance, to keep their lives, predictable, controllable, and making sense. Rather the explanation is simply that they do not find positive feedback credible enough, but they would believe it if they could.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The balance of evidence from an abundance of research over many years shows that positive identities-such as high self-esteem and lower depression-are in general adaptive. First, it feels better subjectively to be higher in self-esteem and lower in depression. Second, higher self-esteem and lower depression predict better outcomes objectively in domains, such as physical health and interpersonal relationships. Similar points can be made about more specific identities: for example, a positive academic identity independently predicts better academic performance. Moreover, many negative identities are objectively unjustified as well as resistant to enhancement. Hence, there is a rationale for intervention to make negative identities more positive, through various types of remedial measures, at an individual level through personal psychotherapy, or at an institutional level through educational programmes. To be effective, however, such interventions need to be guided by theories that are empirically supported. In the absence of any theories, interventions will be haphazard; and in the presence of mistaken theories, they might be counterproductive. Hence, it is important to identify the real barriers to identity change, and not be misled by false non-existent barriers.

A key theory of identity change-self-verification theory-claims that the reason why people with negative identities resist positive identity change is that they want to on balance. A negative identity still affords them as sense that their world is predictable, controllable, and coherent. If so, then the barriers to identity change would be motivational: people with low self-esteem or depression wilfully resist positive feedback to preserve their identity. If so, interventions should focus on bolstering the sense among people with negative identities that their worlds are predictable, controllable, and coherent. This would in turn reduce their need to verify their negative identities, and make them more receptive to positive feedback.

However, suppose that self-verification theory is mistaken. Then, people with negative identities would be inappropriately viewed as striving to resist positive feedback. Interventions based on the idea that their identities are crucial to their sense that the world is predictable, controllable, and coherent might fail to make them more receptive to positive feedback. Suppose that an alternative theory-raison oblige theory-is correct. This says that the main problem, from the perspective of people with negative identities, is the perceived incredibility of positive feedback. Starting from the firmly held if unsound premise that their identities are negative, they nonetheless reason validly that only feedback consistent with that firmly premise is credible. As only apparently credible feedback can be believed, only apparently credible feedback is worth choosing for its informational content; and so, people with negative identities preponderantly choose negative feedback. In this case, interventions would need to focus on convincing people with negative identities that positive feedback was well-founded. If they could be convinced, however, then they would eagerly embrace positive feedback. On the other hand, if raison oblige theory is mistaken, then such effort to convince might fail to make them more receptive to positive feedback. Rather, if self-verification theory is correct, they might reject positive feedback even if convinced of rightness, because it troublingly threatens to undermine their identity. As such, interventions to make negative identities more positive need be informed by knowledge of which theory is ultimately correct.

Our research suggests that raison oblige theory is more correct than self-verification theory. Hence, personal psychotherapy and educational programmes aimed at making negative identities more positive should focus on making feedback more credible, and need not worry about bolstering the sense among people with negative identities that their worlds are predictable, controllable, and coherent.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3FD30E48-BC19-4552-91C3-BABAAC5B8CD2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e24b3cbcc379.40916414</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.changingidentities.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Based on the results of these two experiments, we have put together a manuscript that is close to completion. Below is the abstract of our manuscript:

Alongside the motives to evaluate oneself accurately (i.e., to self-assess) or positively (i.e., to self-enhance) stands another: the motive to confirm one's existing self-views (i.e., to self-verify). One alleged source of evidence for self-verification strivings has been the oft-observed positive correlation between people's self-views (e.g., positive or negative) and their judgments of the accuracy of feedback that were consistent with such self-views (i.e., affirming the valence of those self-views). Here-focusing on an article by Shih et al. (2013)-we contend that this source of evidence is fatally flawed. In particular, such a correlation is liable to be confounded, amongst other factors, by the fact that people's subjective self-views, and their judgments of feedback pertaining to them, are rooted in reality as well as being biased by self-motives. In two illustrative studies, dealing with academic ability and physical height respectively, we found that objective reality (i.e., participants' actual standing on both attributes) predicts accuracy judgments of pertinent feedback, both as well as, and over and above, corresponding subjective self-views. Moreover, we show that the correlation between self-views and accuracy judgments diminishes significantly and substantially when objective reality is controlled for. Accordingly, it is not scientifically appropriate to infer the magnitude of verification strivings from the mere observation of this correlation, an inference that perversely ignores everyday human rationality.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9BC1271E-15BD-405A-8A4F-A5FEF6E185D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This findings highlighted the point that science presumes both that empirical observations made by means of the senses are typically veridical rather than imaginary and that the theoretical inferences made on the basis of them by means of the intellect are typically rational rather than motivated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e03ee3df9f58.44143830</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Academic performance and height</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>In our original submission, we proposed the following studies, indexed by numbers:
