One week later a new station under the direction of the Communist Party was established: &amp;quot;This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.&amp;quot; The station rapidly became the central media tool for communication with the public. Political narratives were interspersed between triumphant music with propagandistic messages during times of war. Programming was diversified after the unification of Vietnam in 1976 and again following economic liberalisation policies from the 1980s onwards. Now accessible to over 90% of the population, the station broadcasts on multiple radio, television and Internet based channels to listeners throughout Vietnam. Debates on key regional issues, such as tensions in the South China Sea and the merits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are framed with the latest popular hits and oldies from the mid-twentieth century. The last remaining early employees of the station are in the latter stages of their lives, and broadcast recordings, diaries, notes and photographs are in danger of being lost forever. Using interview data, participant-observation fieldwork and archival research, this project will examine the history of Vietnamese radio to investigate how state-sponsored audio broadcasts shape identifications with social groups, political parties and nation-states during times of war and peace.

Beyond a localised study of radio and sound, I will provide intellectual leadership to scholars researching music, media and identity by establishing an online network and a special interest group in the Society for Ethnomusicology. I will produce new knowledge on music, ethnicity and identity with a postdoctoral research assistant and contributors to a two-day international conference, which will culminate in a groundbreaking edited volume on this topic with in-depth case studies from around the world. Sustained public engagement activities devoted to knowledge exchange, including high-profile public talks, radio programmes and online articles, will enhance the impact of this research by addressing an audience beyond the academy. Collaborative relationships will be nurtured between scholars, institutions and non-academic bodies in Vietnam and the UK. Dialogue with the general public throughout the duration of the project will ensure that the outputs respond to the needs of media practitioners, musicians and audiences in a meaningful, interactive way.

The principal output will be a monograph, Voice of Vietnam Radio: The Sonic Formation of the State, which will be the first ethnographic study on the history of Vietnamese radio in any language. This book will examine radio in Vietnam through oral histories and the analysis of seminal broadcasts, music recordings and musicians' biographies. Other outputs will include a co-authored scholarly article, several conference papers presented in the UK, Europe and North America, a two-day international conference and teaching materials for modules at the University of Nottingham. Two radio programmes will be produced for broadcast in Vietnam (VOV Radio 4) and the UK (BBC Radio 3) respectively; a short article on the project will be published on the website, BBC Vietnamese; a project blog and Twitter feed will be used to periodically communicate updates on the project; public talks will be presented in Vietnam and the UK; and interview recordings will be stored in the British Library Sound Archive as a historical record for future generations. This project will transform the fields of ethnomusicology and sound studies by developing innovative new research on music, sound and old media in the digital age.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Vietnamese history is an exceptionally challenging field to navigate due to the prevalence of competing colonial, postcolonial, imperial and nationalist agendas. This research will reveal new knowledge about Vietnam's tumultuous recent past and contribute to ongoing processes of self-understanding and reconciliation between northern and southern Vietnamese and other people living within the territories of Vietnam. The project will enrich our understanding of recent Southeast Asian history and improve general awareness of the power and potential of media to educate and manipulate. I will facilitate dialogue between broadcasters, state officials and the general public and between British, Vietnamese and other media broadcasters. 

Non-academic beneficiaries will include: 

1. General public in Vietnam and the UK

The general public will benefit through cultural enrichment, specifically through the appeal of (a) public talks in Vietnam (Irish Embassy event: radio, independence movements and nationalism; L'Espace cultural centre talk: oral history and the cultural significance of the VOV), (b) public talks in the UK (Radio Times Festival: early history of the VOV; WOMAD: revolutionary songs of the VOV Choir), (c) radio broadcasts (BBC Radio 3: early history of radio in Vietnam and relevance to British public; VOV 4: history of the VOV and new ways of engaging minority language communities), (d) workshops with listeners and broadcasters in Vietnam, (e) an article for a non-academic publication (BBC Vietnamese), (f) the project blog and Twitter feed and (g) a submission to the British Library Sound Archive. Selected government officials and employees of international NGOs will be influenced by the research through their attendance at and participation in the public talks.

2. Media broadcasters (primarily Vietnamese)

A critical assessment of the history of radio in Vietnam will highlight areas for improvement and further development, specifically concerning: (a) freedom of the press, (b) willingness to engage in and new ways of enhancing dialogue with listeners, (c) more constructive approaches to reaching ethnic minority and other marginalised communities, (d) methods of producing audience-centred programming, (e) shared knowledge and experience between the BBC and the VOV and (f) programmes created for the BBC and the VOV during the funded period and for National Public Radio (NPR) and VTV following the funded period of research. 

3. International audiences of the BBC and the VOV

The radio programmes, the project blog, the Twitter feed and a non-academic article will reach an international audience via the BBC, the VOV and the University of Nottingham and Twitter websites. These programmes will be shared via social networking sites in Vietnamese and English to enhance the impact and reach of the project. NPR in the United States will be offered an excerpted version of the BBC programme for rebroadcast. 

4. Universities and music colleges (British and Vietnamese)

There are many talented young musicians in Vietnam who have the potential to excel at music institutions in the UK. Knowledge exchange activities and project advertisements will bring further attention to the exceptional quality of tuition at these institutions. This publicity will have long-term economic benefits for higher education in the UK by increasing the number of student applications from Vietnam, a nation of over 90 million people.

These activities will be monitored each month by analysing metadata (page hits, locations and browsing practices) gathered from the project websites. Audience numbers and responses at the talks, listener data from the radio programmes and feedback reports from collaborating institutions in Vietnam will provide supplementary data to assess the extent to which the research is reaching its intended audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>138633</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B255197A-7D4C-4A6D-82E3-35269EBCD9F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Musical Minorities: The Sounds of Hmong Ethnicity in Northern Vietnam</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dc46e0a3adbda9495228c0839f634e75"><gtr:id>dc46e0a3adbda9495228c0839f634e75</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O Briain O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780190626976</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a958888ab7a06.49435907</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AE42EA5B-03F2-4632-ACF8-29DAFA859034</gtr:id><gtr:title>Editorial</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethnomusicology Forum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/076f236f746d6f6325c767b645809083"><gtr:id>076f236f746d6f6325c767b645809083</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>?
