These natural nanotubes exist in the membranes of all biological cells. They control a vast range of biological functions and are crucially important for life. Just lifting a finger requires the coordinated operation of billions of ion channels. Understanding ion channels is relevant to curing many diseases, and may also provide the future basis for bio-computers and their integration with nano-electronics. 

The project promises significant contributions to the EPSRC Physics Grand Challenges (a) &amp;quot;Understanding the Physics of Life&amp;quot; and (b) &amp;quot;Emergence and Physics Far from Equilibrium&amp;quot; - and it has been inspired and encouraged by their associated NetworksPlus.

Channels are extraordinarily complex devices, built of thousands of atoms, and operating under non-equilibrium conditions. They conduct selected ions discretely on &amp;quot;one-by-one&amp;quot; basis. Channels can be very selective, e.g. the calcium channel discriminates between Ca++ and Na+ ions by a factor of 1000, even though they are of almost identical size. Yet a channel conducts almost at the rate of free diffusion, like an open hole. Modelling channels is an innately difficult many-body problem with long range interactions and widely-varying timescales, ranging from ps atomic motion to ms gating dynamics. The detailed structures of some channels are now known, but this knowledge has helped much less than expected/hoped in understanding how they actually work.

Our recent research has involved the analysis of a generic ion channel of very simple form: an open nanotube with some fixed charge around its middle, using both analytic theory and modelling with self-consistent electrostatic Brownian dynamics. We complemented this mesoscale description with molecular dynamics simulations that take account of individual atoms and provide the parameters needed by the analytic description. 

One outcome was our discovery of an emergent phenomenon: a periodic sequence of conduction-bands and stop-bands dependent on the fixed charge. We hypothesise that it is a manifestation of Ionic Coulomb blockade, closely analogous to Coulomb blockade oscillations in quantum dots. In the context of ion channels, this brings an entirely fresh vision of the conduction process. Our new model based on ionic Coulomb blockade seems potentially able to account for numerous earlier observations on wild-type channels and their mutants that have hitherto been regarded as mysterious and puzzling, bringing them together within a consistent, unified, picture. 

We now request the funding needed to exploit this scientific break-through. We will develop an analytic model of ionic Coulomb blockade oscillations, accounting for resonant fluctuation-induced permeation. We will validate the model through an experimental investigation of bacterial sodium channels and their mutants, comparing the measurements with model predictions, and seeking evidence for for Ca2+ and Ba2+ conduction bands, stop-bands and selectivity. By extending the ionic Coulomb blockade model to include the discreteness of the hydration shells around the ion, we can expect to account for selectivity between alike ions, i.e. of equal charge like Na+ and K+. 

From the perspective of our reduced model based on ionic Coulomb blockade, there is no inherent difference between an ion channel and an artificial charged nanopore. So we expect most of our results to be equally applicable to nanopores, if values of charge and dimensions are adjusted appropriately.

The investigations bring ideas from far-from-equilibrium physics to bear on problems in biology that are also applicable to nanotechnology. The work will draw freely on the consortium's special expertise in experiments on ion channels, nonlinear dynamics, fluctuation theory, and molecular dynamics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The expected beneficiaries are: (a) industry, and especially the pharmaceutical industry; (b) the medical profession; and (c) the public. We consider these in turn -

(a) BENEFITS TO INDUSTRY -

The work proposed is basic research, seeking to understand how biological ion channels function. Nonetheless, the chain leading from discovery to practical benefits in the long term is so clear, and so well established by recent successes, that the case is easy to make. There are two books by Frances Ashcroft FRS (&amp;quot;The Spark of Life: Electricity in the Human Body&amp;quot;, Norton, 2012; and &amp;quot;Ion Channels and Disease&amp;quot;, New York, Academic Press, 1999) focussed on just this subject.

The path from channel research to public benefit lies mainly in medical progress. There are literally thousands of diseases that result directly from single-molecule defects in ion channel proteins. If the protein can be modified, e.g. by means of a drug, the disease can be cured. For this reason, ion channels are a primary target of the pharmaceutical industry: in many cases, modification of the protein, by drugs or mutation, can cure the disease; in most cases, modification can greatly ameliorate symptoms. 

Thus the long-term medical impacts relate to the possibility that a deeper appreciation of the physical mechanisms of permeation will yield better drugs targeted on ion channels (like calcium channel blockers) and a better understanding of diseases related to ion channel dysfunction. In particular our discovery of forbidden gaps is likely to be important.

After being validated and further developed, our model will provide a simple and efficient way to calculate the properties of ion channels from a knowledge of their structure, and vice versa to infer the probable structure from the functionality/dysfunctionality. An understanding of the physical reason for the dysfunction of a particular ion channel is likely to help in the optimisation of treatment. 

Another likely path from ion channels to public benefit lies in technology. A wide variety of single molecule sensors is being developed using artificial ion channels as the key devices, including methods to allow cheap and easy reading of DNA sequences. Again, better understanding of how the channels function will almost certainly lead to improved devices. The impact will come from the possibility of calculating and predicting selected nanotube properties from predefined structure/geometry, and vice versa to determine the optimal structure of artificial nanotubes needed to provide the required properties. These possibilities can be used in the exponentially growing industrial applications of nano-filters including artificial ion channels, industrial pollution filters, fast DNA sequencing, and numerous other applications of ion-selective nanotubes.

(b) BENEFITS FOR MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS
In the long term, medical practitioners stand to gain from the improved drugs on offer from the pharmaceutical companies. Channelopathies include some of the scourges of mankind (cystic fibrosis, influenza, and diabetes), so that the potential benefits are nontrivial. In other cases, natural properties of ion channels (like the sensitivity of the herg channel to commonly used pharmaceuticals) has profound public health consequences. In still other (frustrating) cases, small changes in the current through a channel, e.g. the calcium current through the CaV L-type calcium channel, can exert a dramatic influence on longevity. Hundreds of thousands of people die each year from cardiac arrhythmias that would be converted to normal rhythms if one could simply double or triple the calcium current through this type of channel.

(c) BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC
The public stand to benefit from the proposed research programme : (i) in the longer term, through improved medical treatment and technological possibilities (see above); and (ii) culturally during the research itself from our website and outreach activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>785657</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed the ionic Coulomb blockade (ICB) model of permeation and selectivity in biological ion channels, seeking explanations for a range of phenomena that have been observed experimentally in sub-nm artificial nanopores as well as in biological ion channels. Systematic site directed mutagenesis/patch-clamp studies were performed for the NaChBac bacterial channel in order to vary the negative fixed charge Qf at the selectivity filter (SF) in the range |Qf | = 0-12e. Comparisons of the ICB predictions with experimental results (both our own and those in the literature), Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have allowed us to validate the ICB model itself. A local binding extension of the ICB model has been introduced to account for the contribution to selectivity coming from the singular 3D Coulomb terms at the ion-site and from ion-ion electrostatic interactions (complementing the 1D Coulomb interaction already incorporated into the standard ICB model). 

We have also extended the ICB model by development of an equilibrium statistical theory of the permeation process, and a self-consistent non-equilibrium kinetic model based on this statistical theory. Our extended theory takes explicit account of the ionic radius, the excess chemical potential, the structure of distinct binding sites within the filter, and the non-equilibrium conditions caused by differences in potential or in ionic concentration between the bulk solutions on either side of the channel. The theory also encompasses selectivity between ions of the same valence. All the equations used are derived from first principles.

In more detail -

1. Our systematic site-directed mutagenesis/patch clamp studies of NaChBac bacterial channels, varying the fixed charge Qf, have confirmed the strong dependence of the conductance and selectivity on Qf. In doing so we have: (a) trained a post-doctoral researcher in demanding cell biological and electrophysiological techniques, thereby addressing a UK skills gap; and (b) optimised the techniques for establishing heterologous expression of NaChBac and for measuring its activity.

2. We have also generated the extensive data set required for development of the ICB model, including a unique range of mutated NaChBac channels which have structurally different SFs but with similar associated Qf values. Our analysis of the ion permeation properties (covering the full range of both Group I and II metal ions) has highlighted a dependence of ion permeation not only on charge (Qf value), but also on pore architecture.

3. Our development of a novel technique for recording NaChBac channel activity in high Na+ (500 mM) conditions has enabled us to match the conditions used by our Warwick collaborators in their MD simulations of NaChBac-mediated Na+ permeation (see ref below). This work was key to validating the MD simulation approach itself.

4. Our preliminary study of stochastic binding in mixed tetramers has pioneered a way of obtaining partially-charged NaChBac mutants able to provide additional tests of the ICB model.

5. We found that the ICB model can explain some characteristic features of divalent blockade in calcium/sodium ion channels, including: (a) the strong exponential dependence of the blockade threshold IC50 on Qf for NaChBac and its mutants; and (b) the Fermi-Dirac shape of monovalent current decay vs divalent ionic concentration. Our explanation of divalent blockade is based on the enhanced ICB model taking account of the concentration of divalent ions. The ICB model was found to be consistent with the experiments.

6. Our ongoing comparison of ICB model predictions of Na+ occupancy of the SF in NaChBac channels with MD simulations results are yielding promising results.

7. The ICB Model led to a putative resolution of the celebrated &amp;quot;EEEE paradox&amp;quot; between mammalian Calcium channels and bacterial Sodium channels, both of which were thought to have the same Qf. We have suggested that this is not the case, however, and that an additional charged protein residue contributes to Qf in the case of the mammalian channel. 

8. The ICB model has been further developed to account for concentration-related effects, including
(a) Concentration-dependent shifts of the Coulomb staircase for the SF ionic occupancy. These shifts are found to be consistent with the results of earlier BD simulations.
(b) Divalent blockade/anomalous mole fraction effects (AMFE) phenomenon observed in calcium/sodium channels. The predicted AMFE effects are consistent with both mutation experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations.

9. Our most recent enhancement of the ICB model takes account of the local (singular) 3D Coulomb (hyperbolic potential) term for describing attraction to the binding site (i.e. local-site binding). We have found that this correction leads to a geometry-dependent shift of the ICB resonant point which allows us to account separately for the influence on conduction and selectivity of the SF radius and the radius of the charged ring.

10. A similar extension of the 3D local Coulomb ion-ion interaction explains the phenomenon of multi-ion self-organization inside the SF, recently revealed by Brownian dynamics simulations. Multi-ion self-organization leads to a dynamically multi-site pattern, even in a statically single-site channel, and to self-oscillations of ion occupancy inside the SF. These oscillations can lead to resonance in multi-site channels (e.g. the KcsA potassium channel), giving rise to potential energy patterns leading to strong selectivity enhancement. We will try to connect these results with the corresponding results obtained by MD simulations of NaChBac.

11. Application of the statistical mechanics theory of permeation to the KcsA potassium channel has placed into context several earlier ideas, including the &amp;quot;snug fit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;knock-on&amp;quot; conditions, and the Eisenman selectivity relations. 

12. We have provided a first-principles resolution of a long-standing paradox: how can the potassium filter conduct K+ ions at nearly the rate of free diffusion while selecting them over (smaller) Na+ ions almost 1,000-fold? Our explanation involves derivation of an effective grand canonical ensemble of ions in the SF and leads to an analytic expression for its conductivity that takes account of multi-particle interactions. It also shows that the Eisenman-type selectivity equation for ions of equal valence, observed experimentally in earlier work, follows automatically from the condition of diffusion-limited conductivity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The ICB model can be applied by anybody interested in understanding the conduction properties of natural ion channels, or in designing mutants or artificial channels with specific properties. For example -

1. Our ICB model has already been applied successfully (paper in Nature Materials) by a group in Switzerland to explain current-voltage curves for sub-nm Mo2S artificial nanopores. 

2. Eventually the improved understanding of ion channel selectivity mechanisms could lead to the creation of new drugs. 

3. By analysing the mutations underlying the role of the potassium channel in cancer, to we can hope to identify therapeutic targets in cancer patients

The work is paving the way towards a general theory that will enable prediction of the conduction properties of different ions though different channel structures; correspondingly, it should eventually become possible to design the structure needed to exhibit a desired set of features.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8002A276-F0BD-422F-AFB5-37D376A9E59B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dfe09b27f166.91845566</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFF003B9-2778-4CE1-95CE-088C0409889A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Insights into Ion Channel Selectivity with Ionic Coulomb Blockade</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bca5919d1789effca012112db16ee6e2"><gtr:id>bca5919d1789effca012112db16ee6e2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gibby W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56def7d934df44.02823803</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D1B71501-BE83-4ECC-A547-8C976130D064</gtr:id><gtr:title>On Resolution of the Selectivity/Conductivity Paradox for the Potassium Ion Channel</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c4dec15eb04a75a861703fe8bfb8dd7d"><gtr:id>c4dec15eb04a75a861703fe8bfb8dd7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Luchinsky D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bb2ea81d71b2.35608743</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E85F83A1-8A64-4A23-9E77-6284E2F17A79</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sodium Binding Sites and Permeation Mechanism in the NaChBac Channel: A Molecular Dynamics Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of chemical theory and computation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ab745c5eb67054a8835942c989097ab"><gtr:id>2ab745c5eb67054a8835942c989097ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guardiani C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1549-9618</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58beee62201ea7.48111482</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ECBB92E2-188A-4B3C-BDF7-8913323B8485</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relation between selectivity and conductivity in narrow ion channels</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c4dec15eb04a75a861703fe8bfb8dd7d"><gtr:id>c4dec15eb04a75a861703fe8bfb8dd7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Luchinsky D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a913d3467afe1.91164578</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D22298CD-E064-406F-B0E5-F2754163C834</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coulomb blockade model of permeation and selectivity in biological ion channels</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Journal of Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7444dcb462c1e6f0a5e17bf1e15c32bb"><gtr:id>7444dcb462c1e6f0a5e17bf1e15c32bb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kaufman I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56def9795e7203.90022425</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7575F783-72B4-49D9-8F38-C97F191A2495</gtr:id><gtr:title>Vibrational resonance in an inhomogeneous medium with periodic dissipation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review.
