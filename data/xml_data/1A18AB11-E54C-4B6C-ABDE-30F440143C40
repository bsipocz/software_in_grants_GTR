Wellbeing</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L001357/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>There has been a dramatic rise of international and national policy interest in wellbeing, quality of life and happiness research, and particularly in the measurement of wellbeing for public policy purposes. This has intensified post-financial crisis as politicians and policy-makers grapple with new policy goals and political narratives while pursuing economic and employment growth. The UK is at the forefront of developments with David Cameron announcing in November 2010 that wellbeing measures developed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) would be used for public policy purposes. The ONS has since made data available to policy-makers and the Treasury has adjusted its Green Book guidance to government departments in response.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wellbeing as a concept and as policy has been researched and debated extensively in the fields of economics, psychology, sociology, geography and others. However, the discipline of politics has been largely silent, leaving potentially important theoretical and empirical insights absent from debates. In this context, the primary aim of this seminar series is&amp;nbsp;to bring the politics discipline into dialogue with other disciplines and with policymakers, to identify and communicate its distinctive contribution, and to contribute to wellbeing policy debate and policy development in the UK and beyond&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research is intended to have academic beneficiaries wider than the investigators immediate professional circle carrying out similar research. This impact is described in the section on Academic Beneficiaries. Beyond academics, the groups most likely to benefit from the seminar series are the following: 

Politicians: There is significant interest in wellbeing across the political spectrum. This exists at the highest level in the Conservative Party with the Prime Minister and other influential ministers such as Oliver Letwin and David Willetts keen advocates of the wellbeing agenda. The Liberal Democrats 2011 autumn conference approved a policy paper on the importance of quality of life and policies to achieve it. There is also an All Party Parliamentary Group on Well-being Economics, chaired by Jo Swinson MP, with membership from all major parties.

Civil servants: There are high level cross-departmental groups on wellbeing in Whitehall that would be interested in the activities and outputs generated here. More specifically, the Treasury Green Book guidance for government departments has been amended in response to this agenda so that departments are asked to consider the implications for subjective wellbeing of policies. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is leading the national programme for measuring wellbeing, would be particularly interested. Beyond Whitehall there is considerable interest in local authorities, who were given wellbeing powers by the Local Government Act 2000 and a number have since developed their own wellbeing policies and strategies. Scott and Atkinson (a confirmed participant) have already worked with several local authorities (Newcastle, Durham, Stockton, Blyth Valley, Barnsley, Dudley) and can build on those links.

Policy advisers: Key advisors to government including David Halpern are keen advocates of the wellbeing agenda, which connects to other agendas such as behavioural change.

Think tanks: In addition to NEF other think tanks have been active on the issue, including the Young Foundation, the Carnegie Trust and the Institute for Public Policy Research. 

Interest groups: A wide range of interest groups have an interest in the issue, illustrated by participation in the ONS report launch from National Health Service trusts, the Children's Society, Right Property, Action for Happiness, Infinity Health at Work, Business in the Community, and the Equality Trust.

Journalists and commentators: A number of journalists and commentators have followed this issue for several years and the PI has discussed the issue with Radio 4, which ran a short series on the topic in 2012. NEF has excellent contacts in this area. 

Through our exchanges with non-academics, the following questions emerged as of particular interest: 

- How and why has this issue risen up the political agenda in some contexts more than others? 
- What motivates political agents?
- What are the constraints on policy change?
- How do the traditions of ideas in different political parties shape their approach to wellbeing? What implications does/might this have for policy?
- How does wellbeing relate to other social concerns such social justice? 
- How does this issue connect to other governmental agendas such as the behavioural change, the Big Society, and localism?
- What are the appropriate governance arrangements and mechanisms through which effective and accountable wellbeing interventions be advanced?
- How might policy-makers influence behaviour to promote wellbeing?
- What are the political and policy connections between the wellbeing agenda and closely related policy domains such as health, social policy and the environment?

Greater understanding of the answers to these questions has the potential for increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy and, ultimately, enhancing quality of life.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26463</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Newcastle</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Edited book</gtr:description><gtr:id>6B215941-35DF-405E-8343-3081E6FDF5C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>568fb05e4058c5.81019574-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Have developed the proposal in consultation with participants and will edit the collection if the proposal is successful.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>PI Bache and CI Scott have submitted a book proposal to Palgrave MacMillan, which draws on contributions from the seminar series.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Book series</gtr:description><gtr:id>E82FA03E-36DB-4FCC-B47A-D4D35E8F07EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>568fafad7c0796.69973759-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>We will be series editors.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>PI Bache and CI Scott, along with Participant Allin (Visiting Prof at Imperial) have submitted a book series proposal to Palgrave MacMillan on Wellbeing in Politics and Policy.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Book series</gtr:description><gtr:id>AECC2088-324B-4B3A-A40F-3DA3ECB097CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>568fafad7c0796.69973759-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>We will be series editors.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>PI Bache and CI Scott, along with Participant Allin (Visiting Prof at Imperial) have submitted a book series proposal to Palgrave MacMillan on Wellbeing in Politics and Policy.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>New Economics Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>What Works Centre for Wellbeing</gtr:description><gtr:id>C5C89E7C-8C8E-4087-A6D0-C0714F47BDD7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is interdisciplinary and involves a wide range of disciplines including economics, geography, politics, psychology and social policy.

It is difficult to estimate the reach of this activity but the number of page views on the project website from the date of this seminar until the date of the next event (July 17 2015) was 2465 (1998 users) from 11 countries - an average of 27 page views per day. This represented a huge increase in the number of users from the previous period (599) and average page views (10), which partly reflected the increasing interest in the seminar series in the run-up to the concluding conference.

This event generated significant interest through social media and led to other participants being involved in future events. This and subsequent events led to collaborations and outputs.

Seventy-five individuals were present from a number of academic disciplines, government, the third sector and other organisations. There were four plenary speakers - two academic, one the Chair of the European Parliament Development Committee and the other from the OECD. In addition, 21 papers were given in 6 panels. Of these, 19 papers were given by academics and 2 by individuals from think tanks.
The event was publicised through social media, including twitter on the day. It is difficult to estimate the reach of this activity but the number of page views on the project website from the date of this event to the present (January 7 2016) was 2035 (1710 users) from 27 countries) - an average of 13 page views per day.

This event generated significant interest through social media. The papers presented at this conference provided the basis for an edited collection, the proposal for which was submitted to Palgrave MacMillan in December 2015. The PI Bache and CI Scott, along with participant Allin, also applied for a book series on Wellbeing in Politics and Policy, which would draw on contributions from those involved in this conference and other events. The initial feedback on these proposals was very positive and we expect both proposals to be accepted but have yet to have confirmation.

However, it is difficult at this stage to identify clear and direct impacts. As indicated in the final report, the seminar series brought together a wide range of participants - academics, charities, national and local civil servants, think tanks and others - to share knowledge on wellbeing. It is hard to imagine that this knowledge exchange has not had an impact, if only indirect. One illustration is that - through making connections in the seminar series - a number of participants became involved in the What Works Centre for Wellbeing launched in 2015 (including the PI).
In terms of 'findings', this question appears to directed more at a mainstream research grant rather than a seminar series. However, we are currently in the process of producing an edited collection from the series that brings together key contributions. This will be published in 2017 so any impact would not observable for some time. Some authors have already published blogs and working papers related to their chapters and we continue to monitor any impact of outputs. 
Having ticked 'yes' at the beginning I am obliged to tick boxes below to submit. I have done this in the context of having stated that it is difficult to trace any impact at this stage and so have ticked what boxes seem most appropriate given what I have said.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0570BBBB-4385-4F36-A76C-FD11A4CCF325</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ba386f1399b3.22965694</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aims of this seminar series were to bring the Politics discipline into dialogue with other disciplines and with policy-makers, to identify and communicate its distinctive contribution, and to contribute to wellbeing policy debate and policy development in the UK and beyond. This has been achieved through six events that were conducted as outlined on the Case for Support and through related activities and outputs. In total, the events engaged 91 academics from 15 disciplines and 30 policy-makers and others (see Engagement).
In relation to the objectives identified, we have stimulated a new work on wellbeing from the discipline of Politics as well as encouraging other disciplinary perspectives on the politics of wellbeing. No fewer than 52 presentations/papers were given, a selection of which will be published in a forthcoming edited collection (with Palgrave MacMillan). We have informed and stimulated both interdisciplinary and academic-practitioner debates on wellbeing policies through our events and through making papers and summary information available on the project website and also through publicising via Twitter and blogging. We have created a new interdisciplinary network of scholars and practitioners with an interest in the politics and policy of wellbeing in the UK and beyond: the network currently has 135 members. We have disseminated the outcomes of the seminar series through the project website and social media in order to promote public understanding of wellbeing. Between January 2014 and the present (January 2016) the website received 8402 page views from 5299 users in 43 countries.
In relation to the more specific objectives identified, we have promoted understanding of the political and institutional context in which debate on well-being is framed and policy is made. We have done this by introducing theories and insights from political science to colleagues from other disciplines and from the policy world. Through the same means we have promoted understanding of the approaches to wellbeing and policy preferences of different political actors. We have promoted understanding of the relationship between wellbeing debates and policies and post/sustainable growth debates through our political economy seminar in particular, but also through contributions to other events. We have also promoted understanding of developments in Britain in international and comparative perspective, particularly through our concluding conference, which had a number of international contributors. 
In addition to meeting the objectives outlined in the application we generated sponsorship of three events and further publicity from the Newcastle Institute for Social Renewal and the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute. This sponsorship allowed us to both bring in additional speakers and reduce costs to the ESRC. Overall we engaged far more people in the events than we anticipated - both academics and others.
Throughout the programme we maintained a participation policy that sought a gender balance of speakers, panel chairs and participants and sought to promote early career researchers (ECRs). Women contributed 25 of the 52 talks given and chaired 9 of the 18 sessions. ECRs contributed 10 speakers, and chaired 5 sessions. Non-academic participants contributed 12 speakers and chaired 2 sessions. 
Research outcomes are being taken forward via several collaborations and publications generated through the series (see Collaborations and Partnerships). Impact is enhanced by PI and CI engagement in important networks. For example, Bache is Co-Director of the Centre for Wellbeing at the University of Sheffield, with an extensive network of academic and non-academic contacts and Scott is Wellbeing and Policy lead for the Newcastle Institute for Social Renewal, which works at the interface of research, policy and practice. In addition, participants Bache (PI), Abdallah, Atkinson, Wren-Lewis and others are working collaboratively through the Community Wellbeing Evidence Programme of the What Works Centre for Wellbeing involving direct and ongoing dialogue with government and other actors. Scott's role within DEFRA (see Collaboration and Partnerships) further facilitates impact within the policy environment. The edited book and book series on Wellbeing in Politics and Policy, (Bache, Scott and participant Allin), will make a substantial contribution to the academic field. The series has also informed a monograph The Politics and Policy of Wellbeing: Understanding the Rise and Significance of a New Agenda (Edward Elgar) to be published in 2016 (Bache and participant Reardon), as well as articles published by Bache, Scott and many others involved.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Research outcomes are being taken forward via several collaborations and publications generated through the series (see Collaborations and Partnerships).
