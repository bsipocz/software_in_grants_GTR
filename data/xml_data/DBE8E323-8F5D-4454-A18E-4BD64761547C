&lt;p>Social participation refers to taking part in formal and informal groups and associations, cultural and other social and civic activities; whereas social support refers to resources and assistance provided by other persons. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two large existing longitudinal datasets (Whitehall II and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing) will be statistically analysed. Socio-economic and gender differences as well as differences between non-working and working older adults are investigated. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposed study addresses a gap within the research on social determinants of obesity; longitudinal research is needed to provide more robust evidence on the links between social environment, obesity, and weight-related health behaviours. It is possible that lack of social participation, poor social support and negative aspects of close relationships, which often co-occur with economic disadvantage, are amongst the mechanisms through which relative deprivation may influence obesity. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposed research aims to make a practical and meaningful contribution to the NHS guidelines in preventing and treating obesity and increasing physical activity.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Davis</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Globalisation and obesity - {AK}</gtr:description><gtr:id>C2EA37C5-C7C1-4846-8221-380F690B4023</gtr:id><gtr:impact>De Vogli R, Kouvonen A, Gimeno D.

The study has advanced empirical understanding and enhanced knowledge by clarifying the possible mechanisms linking social environmental factors, such as social support and negative aspects of close relationships, to health outcomes. The study contributed to the theories of social support and individual social capital. Scientific impact was additionally achieved through building international cross-disciplinary collaborative networks which have resulted in further 4 joint publications in the area of obesity. In addition, the findings have been built into teaching of postgraduate psychology students and undergraduate social science students. 

Scientific impact of this project was achieved through 3 peer-reviewed articles published in prestigious high-impact international journals, 2 international conference presentations, a presentation in a national conference, and 3 research seminar presentations. 

Non-academic groups that have been interested in the study include public health professionals, policymakers, journalists, and the general public. The project has enhanced research knowledge in the area of social environment and obesity and the findings have implications for public policy and clinical practice. Awareness of the importance of stable, nurturing relationships might help individuals when aiming to keep physically active and prevent weight gain. In health promotion programmes it would be important take the individual's social relationships into account. 

The study has been widely reported in the national and international media increasing the awareness of the issues in the public. PI has also presented the wider context of the study (social determinants of health) in knowledge exchange events. This has resulted in requests for further information and discussions about further related activity (such as further presentations). Results have also been used in PI's UG and PG teaching in three countries (UK, Poland, Finland) in which she has hold permanent academic positions since the grant.

One of the published articles (Kouvonen et a; 2012 J Aging Health) was included in a sustained literature review: International evidence base on the long-term health benefits of participation in the arts (2014), funded by the AHRC http://longitudinalhealthbenefits.wordpress.com/</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7A75AF39-B628-4E69-B181-D2B5A8161722</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447a9ff6eb542.22339393</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The results showed that long-term experience of negative aspects of close relationships may be associated with a higher likelihood of increases in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) over time. Moreover, we found that high confiding/emotional support from the closest person may, to some degree, help the individual to maintain the recommended level of leisure-time physical activity. However, confiding/emotional support was not associated with improvement in physical activity levels among those participants who initially reported low physical activity, and practical support was not associated with physical activity. In addition, we found that social participation in education, arts or music groups, or evening classes, and in charitable associations was associated with maintaining recommended WC over long term (the participants were followed up for 4 years) among initially lean men, whereas participation in one or three or more organisations was associated with an increased likelihood of ongoing higher waist among initially large-waisted men. Findings for women were less clear and there was no clear evidence to suggest that social participation is associated with maintaining or achieving recommended WC. 

Our results confirmed that weight gain and physical activity are not determined only by individual factors but also by social environmental characteristics. Our results suggest that high emotional support and stable, nurturing relationships with low levels of conflicts and stress might help the individual to avoid gaining weight and to keep physically active. 

The grant was also important for capacity building and since completing this study the PI has progressed to a permanent academic position (first in 2012 to Lectureship in Queen's University Belfast and in 2014 to Senior Lectureship in the University Helsinki, Finland). Moreover, she has continued researching social determinants of health and obesity and published widely on these topics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In health promotion programmes it would be useful to take the individual's close social relationships into account. Our results further suggest that aspects of social participation may be a potential additional component to be integrated in interventions designed to prevent weight gain. However, the results should be interpreted with caution since the role of social participation for weight loss and among women is unclear and replication is required. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that social environmental factors work in the wider context of health-related circumstances, such as income inequality, which are not easily amenable. 

The findings are also useful for other researchers in the area of social determinants of health and this is evidenced by citations of the 3 papers produced by this grant (19 citations so far on PubMed Central).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>18606A2E-7177-4A48-A22A-7FE5A712E39C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6712182207.69631b2f19908</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Inclusion in sustained literature review: international evidence base on long-term health benefits of participating in the arts - {AK}</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E1F0B54-6F8F-4E07-87AC-37E1BCB18F01</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5452257795fd62.76549136</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://longitudinalhealthbenefits.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>67D32BD3-4901-44C6-A7FF-30091F44F7EE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Obesity and socioeconomic disadvantage in midlife female public sector employees: a cohort study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC public health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/33406e8638f13e410109a73ed69a9aa2"><gtr:id>33406e8638f13e410109a73ed69a9aa2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hiilamo A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2458</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>59f2e76c763270.95415017</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B6890748-0B0D-42EB-B488-3817C40B1DDB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Negative aspects of close relationships as a predictor of increased body mass index and waist circumference: the Whitehall II study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of public health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00219323983f26bf48eee3a1451b7a74"><gtr:id>00219323983f26bf48eee3a1451b7a74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kouvonen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0090-0036</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cbfe9bfe97b74b3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0BAE9C56-8329-4463-8594-071DD84DBC8C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social support and the likelihood of maintaining and improving levels of physical activity: the Whitehall II Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of public health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00219323983f26bf48eee3a1451b7a74"><gtr:id>00219323983f26bf48eee3a1451b7a74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kouvonen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1101-1262</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cbfecbfec3510b0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F2B0CE69-B4AD-47D6-8834-D32A7B45DEF6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social participation and maintaining recommended waist circumference: prospective evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of aging and health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00219323983f26bf48eee3a1451b7a74"><gtr:id>00219323983f26bf48eee3a1451b7a74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kouvonen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0898-2643</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cbff3bff38a1e37</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3489</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G039070/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
