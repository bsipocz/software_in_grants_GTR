Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious form of acute lung injury, which kills over 40% of sufferers. In this condition, there is failure of the breathing system, with patients requiring support from a breathing machine or 'ventilator' to deliver oxygen into the lungs. The use of ventilators can itself produce or worsen lung injury, a term called 'ventilator-induced lung injury' (VILI). 

Patients with ARDS die most often from failure of multiple organs in the body, rather than lung failure alone. Reducing VILI is the only measure proven to reduce deaths from ARDS. However, we do not fully know how VILI occurs and why it is associated with failure of multiple organs and high death rates. Only supportive measures currently exist for treating VILI, and there remains an urgent need for new treatments.

Microvesicles (MVs) are very small particles that are released by cells when they are injured or inflamed, carry messages between cells, and may play an important role in communication between cells. MVs are capable of carrying numerous inflammatory messenger molecules in a packaged environment without being broken down in the bloodstream, unlike these signals in isolation. We have previously shown that VILI causes significant inflammation in the lungs, causing the activation of inflammatory cells called monocytes within small blood vessels in the lungs to release inflammatory signals into the bloodstream. If these monocytes within the lungs also produce MVs during VILI, these MVs may play an equally important and potentially more significant role than individual inflammatory messenger molecules released directly into the bloodstream, in causing damage to remote organs in the body and their subsequent failure. Targeting these MVs produced from monocytes within the lung may provide a new strategy to treat VILI.

We have shown in preliminary experiments that exposing monocytes within the lung to high stretch conditions (as seen in VILI) causes the release of significant numbers of MVs from these monocytes. We have shown that these MVs are of an inflammatory nature, causing damage to cells from blood vessels at sites distant from the lung.

Research Question and Objectives: 
We propose that VILI causes a substantial release of MVs from monocytes within the lung, and these MVs play a crucial role in spreading inflammation in VILI, resulting in injuries and failure of organs distant from the lung. Our objectives are to:

1) Investigate how MVs are produced from monocytes within the lung during VILI and what these MVs contain.
2) Identify what effects these MVs cause to distant body parts and how they cause these effects.

Research Methods:
The project will involve detailed laboratory experiments using different experimental models of VILI. To investigate MV production, I will perform experiments stretching monocytes and other cells found in the lung, aiming to identify the inflammatory and genetic content of MVs produced in these models. To investigate MV effects on body parts distant from the lung, I will add MVs produced in my initial experiments to different experimental models and observe resulting biological effects in peripheral organs in these models. Promising strategies identified to block MV production and resulting harmful biological effects will also be evaluated in these experimental models.

Anticipated Benefits:
Our results could identify key strategies to block production and effects of MVs, which may allow the development of new medicines to treat this devastating disease. This could result in a reduction in complications after ARDS, helping patients to recover faster, while reducing the burden placed on their families, workplaces, and the NHS.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has a mortality of over 40%, with most deaths due to multi-organ failure (MOF) and no specific therapies available. Reducing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is the only therapy proven to reduce ARDS mortality, presumably because VILI promotes propagation of lung inflammation to other organs leading to MOF. We previously showed that VILI induces pulmonary microvascular inflammation through activating lung-marginated monocytes. We hypothesise that microvesicles (MVs) from these monocytes play a key role in lung-to-periphery inflammatory propagation.
Aims: Investigate MVs from lung-marginated monocytes as targets for selectively controlling propagation of lung inflammation to end organs in VILI.
Objectives: 
1) Investigate mechanisms of monocyte-derived MV production during VILI.
2) Identify mechanisms of uptake and cargo transfer of these MVs by remote organs, to establish their role in end organ injury.
Methods: I will investigate stretch-induced MV production using our unique in vitro (cyclical stretch of lung endothelial cells co-cultured with monocytes) and ex vivo isolated perfused mouse lung VILI models, with MV production analysed by flow cytometry and confocal/electron microscopy, and MV cargoes quantified by immunoassays/RT-PCR. I will investigate MV uptake/biological effects using in vitro models and an ex vivo isolated perfused kidney model, and inject labelled MVs into intact in vivo mouse models to validate findings. I will assess biological relevance of promising pathways identified for stretch-induced MV production using in vivo VILI models with inhibitors/knockouts. MV uptake/biological effects will be evaluated by flow cytometry, immunoassays/immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, focusing on inflammatory activation and death signalling.
Opportunities: Crucial insights into mechanisms of MOF during VILI, and potential development of novel ARDS therapies targeting lung-marginated monocytes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this project will significantly enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of multi-organ failure (MOF) during ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which could potentially lead to future novel therapeutic strategies to treat this devastating disease. As such, our research could have a significant wider impact beyond academic beneficiaries.

Translational Clinical Impact:
Our research will provide crucial insights into the pathophysiology of VILI and resulting MOF, which will inform all clinicians involved in the care of critically ill patients (e.g. intensivists, anaesthetists, surgeons, medical physicians). Our results may also lead to future development of novel therapies to help treat this devastating disease, as well as the potential utilisation of microvesicles as a diagnostic tool and marker for disease progression and response to treatment. This could have a significant impact in reducing mortality and improving outcomes for patients with ARDS. 

Patient Support Groups:
National and international patient support groups for ARDS and critical illness will be able to use an improved understanding of the time course and pathophysiology of MOF during VILI and ARDS to counsel patients and their relatives, as well inform research funders, policy makers and the pharmaceutical industry.

Societal Impact:
The improved understanding of how MOF develops with critical illness and mechanical ventilation could help to inform evidence-based government policy-making and influence allocation of critical care resources within the NHS in the future. The potential for future novel therapies from this project could also help in reducing the financial burden of this disease on NHS resources through reducing the length of critical care admissions and rehabilitation after critical illness.

Commercial Impact:
The results from our project will be of potential value to private sector firms, such as biotechnology companies and the pharmaceutical industry, who are seeking to develop 1) novel diagnostic techniques for identifying markers of ARDS progression and response to treatment; or 2) novel therapies for VILI and ARDS. Although we are not anticipating the development of novel therapies during the lifetime of this project, an improved understanding of VILI and MOF pathophysiology from our work may identify key therapeutic targets for future development.

Training of Skilled Staff:
I will benefit immeasurably from this project, through receiving a broad range of training in specific technical skills, advanced expertise in respiratory cell and molecular biology, and generic research skills that will progress my career as an academic clinician. I aim to use the broad range of skills and expertise acquired from this project to train other researchers in this field during my long-term academic career. This could have benefits in delivering highly skilled researchers into both the public sector (e.g. as future clinicians within the NHS, or academics within research institutes) and the private sector (e.g. pharmaceutical and biotech companies).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>273580</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R001472/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
