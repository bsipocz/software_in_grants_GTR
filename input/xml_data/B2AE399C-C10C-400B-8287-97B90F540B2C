&lt;p>This research programme aims to examine, within that framework, how democratic traditions of media freedom which characterise and sustain our liberal democracy through open, informed public debate - the basis of the public's right to know - can best be balanced against the contemporary demands of national and international security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first of three linked projects looks at the media experience of reporting on terrorism. Using interviews with journalists and lawyers, the project will study the impact of the legal framework and consider also how agencies of the government manage and release information.&amp;nbsp;The second project analyses legislative and judicial approaches to balancing openness and secrecy. The third project brings key stakeholders together at a conference to elicit and analyse their perspectives on how openness and secrecy should be balanced to achieve both liberty and security.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251951</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Written evidence - supplementary (Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry into Green Paper on Justice and Security)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D14ED3BE-3958-4FF1-B1D3-E785B1D84461</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See impacts below.

(1) The way information relating to terrorism and security is controlled and managed by the state, and the way it is accessed by the media. The research analysed the legal framework in the UK and undertook comparative analysis (notably with Australia), and gathered original data which sheds light on the practices of information control, management and access. It appears to be the only work which has collected original interview-based data. Among areas of note, it provided empirical evidence relating to the effects on the media of laws (specifically Terrorism Act 2000, s 38B) that criminalise the failure to disclose information about terrorism. 

(2) Methodology in socio-legal studies and security research. The project makes a modest but meaningful contribution to methodology with regard to the difficulties in undertaking security research. It offers insights into when one cannot know if interviewees are telling the truth or are able to tell the truth. The literature does not currently address this difficulty, even in the major works on methodology in socio-legal studies or security research.

(3) Judicial perspectives on terrorism cases. Overcoming significant access hurdles, the project gathered for the first time accounts from the judiciary of their experience of terrorism cases. This is a major achievement given the long British involvement in Northern Ireland and the now fairly extensive number of prosecutions on the mainland since 2005. Using freedom of information requests, the project also gathered evidence that documents judicial participation in academic research generally. 

(4) The implications of extending regimes of closed legal proceedings. The project examined, among other matters, how adverse effects in the long term may be mitigated by systems for subsequent review of closed judgments.

Economic and societal impact included: 

First, it helped shape the Justice and Security Act 2013 (JSA) that now permits the use of closed material proceedings in civil actions. The Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) report quoted my evidence in detail, describing 'the impact on media freedom and democratic accountability' as 'the missing issue' in the Green Paper. All my recommendations were proposed as amendments by Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers, and several in the Commons Public Bill Committee. I was asked to draft some amendments and was expressly acknowledged by name in parliamentary debates. Of course, not all succeeded, but some did (eg, government must now report annually to parliament on the use of closed proceedings). A major recommendation the JCHR adopted was that open justice should be a criterion when deciding whether closed proceedings should be used. Amendments saw it added to the Bill and then replaced by an alternative (&amp;quot;effective administration of justice&amp;quot;), with the Lords vote on the open justice amendment narrowly defeated 174-158 votes. However, the arguments are in the record and will be points of reference when the law is interpreted, applied and reviewed.

Secondly, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) guidelines for prosecution of cases affecting the media appear to have been influenced by my work. The CPS consulted on the interim guidelines. I responded, arguing that the chilling effect of prosecutions should be considered. The interim guidelines were changed with the CPS reporting only two respondents raised that issue.

Thirdly, there is reason to think that my work had some influence on media approaches to the JSA and issues relating to closed judgments. My submissions on the JSA attracted interest from media lawyers with one senior lawyer describing them as 'a tour de force'. Subsequent to the JSA, one of my arguments for amendment to the Bill - that there be a system for reviewing closed judgments to ensure they could be open when secrecy was no longer required - was argued by a media organisation in a case before the High Court R (Evans) v Sec of State for Defence [2013] EWHC 3068 (Admin).

After the project ended impact continued, including: 

Fourthly, the South African Supreme Court of Appeal cited my research in a 2015 decision that changed the law in that country when it held that all court records are public documents open to public scrutiny and that any departure from that principle is an exception that must be justified: City of Cape Town v South African National Roads Authority Ltd &amp;amp; others [2015] ZASCA 58 (30 March 2015).

Fifth, by 2015 the effects of the legislative provision that requires the government to report annually to parliament on the use of closed proceedings (see above, paragraph beginning, &amp;quot;First ...&amp;quot;) were beginning to be felt. The government's first annual report in 2014 had very little detail in it and there were omissions. Following an analysis I did and recommendations I made after that report, the Ministry of Justice wrote to me indicating my recommendations would be considered with a view to providing further information pursuant to the legislation. The government's second annual report in 2015 provided much more information. (Note: the analyses were done after the completion of the award project, but the impact - the provision of further information - follows from the inclusion of the legislative requirement that arose in the award project.) 

Sixth, in 2016 the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) addressed the issue which I had identified in the 2013 legislative process, and which (explained above) was argued at the High Court in 2015: that there should be a system for reviewing closed judgments to ensure they could be open when secrecy was no longer required. In Parliament in 2013 the Minister agreed the point had force but it could not be resolved at that time. The Court of Appeal in The Guardian v R and Incedal [2016] EWCA Crim 11 (para 80) directed the Court's Registrar to form a working party that would consider issues including that one. There is no specific reference to my work but the link appears to tie back clearly, based on what I understand was argument by the lawyers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5257AA76-8D05-4BA3-8C22-67B37B8FB96F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5465307c2ab0c1.66296461</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The findings have been documented in outputs expressly aimed at scholarly audiences and in outputs aimed at scholarly and other audiences.

(1) The way information relating to terrorism and security is controlled and managed by the state, and accessed by the media; 

(2) Methodology in socio-legal studies and security research. Key outputs include:
? A book chapter (2010) and journal article (2010) examining legal frameworks for obtaining journalistic material, focusing especially on production orders and protections at investigatory stages. 
? A book chapter (2014) that examined journalists' experience of reporting on terrorism matters. 
? Numerous conference and seminar papers to scholarly audiences.
? A conference and summary resource paper as part of a research training event for PhD students from across the UK and across disciplines. 
? A further major piece is in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal (Legal Studies), which will examine lawyer, government and policing perspectives, along with methodology. A second will examine disclosure obligations (Criminal Law Review). 

(3) Judicial perspectives on terrorism cases. Key outputs include:
? A conference paper and publication in proceedings (2012). 
? A further major piece is in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal (Modern Law Review).

(4) The implications of extending regimes of closed legal proceedings. Key outputs include: 
? A list of cases likely to be subject to closed proceedings (2012) 
? Written and oral evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights (2012)
? Response to the Cabinet Office consultation on the Justice and Security Green Paper (2012)
? A further major piece is in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal (Public Law).
