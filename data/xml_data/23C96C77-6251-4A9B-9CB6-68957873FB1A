&lt;p>Particular attention will be paid to the organisation of everyday life, cultural conventions, household dynamics and a range of different actors within the food system. Additionally, through a series of multi-stakeholder workshops and exhibitions - involving academic researchers, retailers, non-governmental organisations and policy makers - this project will share data, develop state of the art thinking about food waste and identify innovative practical mechanisms for its reduction.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The reduction of food waste is an issue that currently engages a wide range of stakeholders. This project will develop understandings and insights into the causes of food waste, will identify novel approaches for managing it at the level of the household, and stimulate debate about how waste might be prevented via broader changes in the food system. Further, it will do so in close collaboration with a number of relevant stakeholders. 

The main beneficiaries of this research are as follows:

1) Retailers and businesses that are currently developing strategies to help their customers reduce the amount of food that they waste. 

This project will be co-funded by Tesco, precisely because they are interested in understanding why households waste food and what they could or should be doing in order to tackle it. The proposed research will be used to inform the development and direction of the campaign that they are starting to plan in order to help their customers reduce the amount of food that they waste. Additionally, other retailers are working towards similar objectives and the proposed research will make social scientific perspectives on household food waste and behavioral change available to them.

2) Policy Makers who have identified the importance of reducing the amount of food that is wasted at the level of the household.

Reducing food waste is a concern that is manifest at many different levels ranging from Local Authorities, through national (e.g. Defra) and regional (e.g. the Scottish Government) policy makers through to supra-national bodies such as the European Union and the United Nations. The proposed research will develop the evidence base that informs policy making and legislation at all of these levels, both in terms of why food waste is occurring and how it might be reduced. 

3) Non-Governmental Organizations who are involved in developing campaigns to reduce household food waste.

It is not just government bodies that have an interest in reducing household food waste. A number of other organizations are playing an important role, most notably WRAP - the Waste and Resources Action Programme but also the Institution of Mechanical Engineers who published a high profile report on the extent of problems associated with food waste (IMechE, 2013) and charities such as Waste Watch (now part of Keep Britain Tidy). Again, the proposed research will develop the evidence base that can be drawn upon to inform strategies for household food waste reduction. 

4) Households and Citizens

In developing strategies to reduce food waste, this project has the potential to benefit households. Existing research suggests that households are anxious about the food that they waste and are looking for help and advice in reducing it. Additionally, it is estimated that preventing food waste could save the average family &amp;pound;680 a year.

More generally, this project has the potential to be of use to members of these groups (especially policy makers and Non-Governmental Organizations) who are not directly interested in food waste but are interested in household dynamics and behavioral change.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161295</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Members of the research team met with senior representative of the Co-operative</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71C5886B-92F4-43E6-8CD4-48BA25037CE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DIscussion around sustainability and the convenience food sector

The stakeholder event brought together an invited audience of over 80 policy makers, academics, business people and NGOs to discuss system transitions for waste reduction alongside the relationships between food waste and broader issues of sustainability in food systems. 
 
The event involved a round table discussion led by a panel including Dr. Tim Fox (Fellow and former Head of Energy and Environment, the Institute of Mechanical Engineers &amp;amp; Global Ambassador, Dearman), Mark Driscoll (Head of Food, Forum for the Future), Mark Little (Head of Food Waste Reduction, Tesco), Emma Marsh (Head of Love Food Hate Waste, WRAP), Louise Nicholls (Head of Responsible Sourcing - Plan A &amp;amp; Packaging Technology, Marks and Spencer) and SCI project lead Dr. David Evans.

The roundtable sparked lively discussion that followed through to the wine reception and has been followed up with extensive positive feedback and an apetite to capitalise on the 'community of practice' that project has created. Several people (including Bruce Jackson from the ESRC) commented that this event was and 'innovative' and 'exemplary' model for knowledge transfer and impact. 
 
The event also saw the launch of the project's stakeholder report 'Food Waste Transitions: Consumption , Retail and Collaboration towards a Sustainable Food System'. Baroness Scott of Needham Market (Chairman, House of Lords European Union Sub-Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Environment and Energy, 2013-15) kindly offered an endorsement of the report:
 
&amp;quot;Food waste poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of food systems. In addition to the environmental and economic impacts of the food we waste, there are significant social costs that need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The burden of responsibility for making the necessary changes is often placed on households and consumers. However, successful responses require collaboration across the supply chain. This must-read report shows that consumption matters, but highlights its relationships with the component parts of the food chain and the organisation of societies more generally. It acknowledges that the United Kingdom is leading the way in collaboration for waste reduction and notes that retailers are starting to take their responsibilities seriously. The authors identify the conditions that have enabled this to happen in relation to food waste and ask how these might inform thinking about the wider issue of a transition towards a sustainable food system.&amp;quot;

We analysed a survey of c.70,000 Tesco customers as well as a survey of eating habits in the UK completed by c.2800 online panel members. This allowed us to explore the relationship between the organisation of meal occasions, the production of leftovers, and waste generation. For each meal, detail was gathered on a range of elements and we grouped these into temporal (e.g. day of the week, time of day, and duration of the meal), contextual (e.g. with whom, and where the meal was eaten), and preparatory factors (e.g. where the food or ingredients were from, how the ingredients were stored, method of preparation). All of these factors were found to have an effect on the production of leftovers. For example:

- Contextual factors: Compared with meals eaten alone, meals eaten with household members are over twice as likely to produce leftovers (2.331***), meals with friends almost 3 times (2.890***), and meals with non-household family members almost 3.5 times as likely to have leftovers (3.439***). When a combination of people ate together, the likeliness of there being leftovers increases fivefold (5.115***)
- Temporal factors: Compared with morning meals, food is more likely to be left following afternoon meals (2.345***) and even more so following evening meals (2.647***). Compared with meals lasting less than 10 minutes, meals lasting 10-19 minutes are 53.4% more likely to produce leftovers (1.534***) and meals lasting longer than an hour are seven times more likely to produce leftovers (7.098***)
- Preparatory factors: Leftovers are more likely when meals are made using ingredients stored in the fridge (1.503***) or items that have just been bought (2.043***). Meals are made using a mix of cooking methods, but meals containing items ready to eat are less likely to produce leftovers (0.548***) whereas leftovers are more likely when meals are prepared on the hob (1.557***) and the oven (2.079***). 

Taken together, this suggests the more socially significant a meal is - such as a dinner party with family and friends (as compared to a ready meal eaten alone) - the more likely it is that there will be leftovers that are at risk of going to waste. Our analysis suggests that the likelihood of leftovers being wasted (rather than eaten) is explained almost exclusively by a single variable: how much food is left over. Compared with meals where 30 to 50 per cent was left over, meals with 10 to 30 per cent left over are 19 times more likely to be wasted (19.471**) and leftovers from meals with seemingly insignificant amounts (i.e. less than 10 per cent left over) are 130 times more likely to enter the waste stream (130.329***). No meal with more than 50 per cent left over was sent to waste.

The project also conducted 33 interviews with 38 stakeholders in order to explore the ways in which the challenge of food waste reduction is being framed, interpreted and responded to by engaged constituencies (including policy makers, third sector organisations, campaigners and consultants) with a specific focus on the interface of households and retailers. This was complemented by our observations at a number of food waste conferences, and by hosting our own multi-stakeholder workshop. We marked the end of the project by staging a public event and a discussion - led by an expert panel (including representatives from major retailers, NGOs and think tanks) - on the relationships between food waste and transitions towards a sustainable food system. We found that contemporary responses to the challenge of food waste reduction are characterized two distinct waves (2007 - 2013; 2013 - present), marked by their differences in the configuration of relationships between relevant constituencies, and by the ways in which they construct and mobilize 'the consumer'. While the initial responses (2007 -2013) framed the challenge in terms of individual consumer responsibilities and behaviour change, our analysis suggests that during the second wave (2013 - present), a multi-stakeholder coalition rapidly developed around the issue. Unlike many contentious social and environmental challenges, in which there are rival problem framings, we found a broad consensus around an ensemble of shared ideas and understandings. Crucially, there is widespread recognition that responsibility for food waste reduction is distributed throughout the food chain and that the links between parts of the system are key. 

Our analysis suggests that the emergence of this food waste coalition was enabled by a 'perfect storm' of issues in which concerns about austerity, food price inflation, food poverty, food security, and climate change all came together at the same time. We also identify a number of other 'enabling conditions' including: 

- The importance of issue lifecycles: Food waste rose to prominence at a point when wider issues of waste - e.g. household recycling - had already reached a level of maturity. 
- The lack of counter-constituencies: Crucial to the emergence of the food waste coalition has been the lack of competing framings of the issue (for example from large businesses).
- Previous campaigning and agenda setting: The initial responses wave of food waste campaigning - with its emphasis on the responsibilised consumer - may have served the important purpose of driving the issue of food waste up the agenda and securing the participation and action of major retailers. Retailers are currently assuming responsibilities for waste reduction upstream (with suppliers) and downstream (with consumers). 
- The role of honest brokers and trusted intermediaries: The food waste coalition would not have been possible without WRAP-whose credibility with business, commitment to evidence and arm's length connection to government facilitated agenda setting, awareness raising, and a neutral forum for collaboration and consensus building

The project ended by suggesting that experiences and lessons from the study of food waste reduction (see above) might be instructive for thinking about broader transitions to sustainability in food systems.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings re: the organisation of meal occasions, the production of leftovers and waste generation are instructive for a number of academic debates. Principally, they extend the sociological literature on household and consumer food waste that has hitherto been dominated by qualitative and ethnographic studies. Allied to this, they extend the literature that applies insights from theories of practice to the study of household sustainability and behaviour change. The methodological techniques developed in this project illustrate strategies for mobilizing theories of practice empirically using quantitative data. Our findings also contribute to more general sociological understandings of food, eating and the temporal organization of everyday life. In terms of practical applications, these findings extend the evidence base on why household and consumers waste food. Insights from quantitative as well as qualitative studies are important for groups (policy makers, NGOs, firms, campaigners, households) who are involved in efforts to reduce household and consumer food waste. Our findings advocate distinguishing between the cause and location of waste; focusing on shared conventions around food and eating, and thinking about where, when and how meals are eaten. 

Our findings re: the ways in which the challenge of food waste reduction is being framed, interpreted and responded are instructive for a different set of academic debates. Principally they offer empirically grounded sociological insights into supermarkets and extend the literature on the relationships between firms and civil society. The project was particularly successfully in obtaining access to major retailers and so it illustrates useful strategies for researching and collaborating with commercial partners (see Evans 2015). Our project contributes to the sociological literature on sustainable consumption and behaviour change by suggesting that more attention is paid to the discursive figure of 'the consumer' and the changing ways in which it is strategically deployed by a range of collective actors. In terms of practical applications, our findings may be of use to stakeholders (firms, governments, transnational organizations, NGOs, citizens) who are involved in thinking about transitions to greater sustainability in food systems.
