properties of the protein components of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles and their interactions with host proteins. Our aim is to understand exactly how the virus initiates infection of its target cell and how it interfers with the workings of the host cell to cause disease. HCV is a major cause of serious liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 200 million people globally are infected with this virus, a significant number of whom will go on to develop serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current worldwide projections estimate that HCV in particular will be a major source of morbidity and mortality before the end of this decade. Although new promising treatments are now becoming available, there are many unmet needs and there is as yet no vaccine available. Therefore, basic research on viral proteins to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of virus infection is needed to develop better anti-viral therapies. Our investigations of the functions and structures of the relevant virus and host proteins will allow better understanding of the processes involved in virus life cycle and disease. The information gained will be crucial in developing novel antiviral drugs and vaccines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease that often leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Promising new treatments are now becoming available, but they are focused on one viral genotype. There are many unmet needs and therefore HCV will remain a serious threat for the foreseeable future. There is as yet no vaccine available. To develop new targets for a broad and more effective therapy, and preventative vaccines, it is necessary to gain greater insights into the processes involved in virus life cycle and their effects on cellular metabolism.

Our research is focused on investigating the mechanisms of HCV entry into target cells and the interactions between viral and cellular components involved in virus life cycle and pathogenesis. Specifically, we have been studying virus neutralizing antibodies and their mode of action both at structural and functional level, modes of virus transmission in cultured cells, and the functional significance of the interaction between the HCV core protein and host factors. Closely aligned to the above work, we have (1) developed several robust cell-based high-throughput screening assays that have enabled us to identify novel anti-viral compounds targeting different stages of the virus life-cycle and (2) an on-going translational project on the development of antibody-based vaccine against HCV.
My group is a member of the Glasgow HCV Network (a consortium of clinicians and scientists) and a national consortium called HCV Research UK focused on fundamental research, clinical studies and translational approaches on HCV. Our aim is to investigate molecular mechanisms that contribute to HCV-associated pathogenesis. The work performed under this programme includes whole genome transcriptome analysis in diseased liver, and investigating host factors that determine viral clearance or progression to chronicity and extrahepatic disorders.
In addition, we are studying the interaction between HCV core and the cellular DEAD-box protein, DDX3. Our data show that this interaction is dispensable for virus life cycle, but may be involved in apoptosis, oncogenesis and aspects of innate immunity. We also find that DDX3 interacts with a variety of cellular factors involved in host RNA metabolism thus implicating the core-DDX3 interaction in these processes, which may in turn contribute to viral pathogenesis. We are investigating the mechanisms for the sequestration of the host factors and their functions in infected cells. Identification of functional pathways is likely to provide novel targets for pharmacological intervention and treatment of HCV-related diseases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1997-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4562698</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC - University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>Chimeric HCV isolates</gtr:description><gtr:id>AFE04066-B499-461A-996B-3CF72BC6D4CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The chimeric viruses are currently being characterised.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>iGEXdNYkL38-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Plasmids carrying sequences of interest supplied by our collaborator to facilitate this study</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Generated chimeric HCV incorporating the viral glycoproteins sequences from diverse genotypes which were supplied to us by our collaborator.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pasteur Institute, Paris</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Novel anti-HCV antibodies and their analyses</gtr:description><gtr:id>93C91C8A-4616-41E0-B5D7-6D90F4D784E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A manuscript describing the structural basis of the conformational flexibility in the central Ig-like domain of E2 has been submitted for possible publication in a high impact journal.

These data showed that the peptide in complex with DAO5 adopted a helical conformation that is in stark contrast to the extended conformation observed in the E2 core structure. It was also observed that MAb DAO5 binds to soluble E2 (sE2) in a temperature-dependent manner and despite the lack of neutralizing activity it directly cross-competes with the virus receptor CD81 and other conformational neutralizing mAbs recognizing a critical epitope residue (D535). These results suggest that mAb DAO5 recognizes natively folded sE2 locally displaying a high degree of flexibility in this crucial CD81 binding region.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Generated novel mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting different regions of HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 and performed their detailed functional characterization. Two of these (MAbs DAO1 and DAO3) were found to target novel conformation-sensitive epitopes on E2. We also identified one antibody (MAb DAO5) that bound to a major virus receptor binding site (aa 523-540) which forms part of the central immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain within HCV E2. A detailed epitope mapping experiments identified aa D535 to be crucial for DAO5 recognition of E2. Interestingly, D535 is also critical for the interation between HCV E2 and CD81, a host factor essential for virus entry. Curiously though, MAb DAO5 did not neutralize virus infection. We have now obtained a crystal structure of the epitope peptide in compelx with MAb DAO5 in collaboration with scientists at Pasteur Inst, Paris.

Further studies on hightroughput sequencing of data patient biopsies have revealed interesting information. Briefly, HCV gentoype (gt) 1-infected biopsies displayed elevated levels of transcripts regulated by Type I and Type III interferon (IFN), including genes that predict response to IFNa therapy. In contrast, genes controlled by IFN? were induced in gt3-infected biopsies. Moreover, IFN? levels were higher in gt3 samples compared to gt1 and control biopsies. Analysis of hepatocyte-derived cell lines confirmed that the genes up-regulated in gt3 infection were predominantly induced by IFN?. The distinct interactions of the two viral genotypes with hepatic cells may explain differences in the progression of disease pathology and treatment response under both IFN-based treatments and novel direct acting antivirals. A separate study demonstrated the presence of anti-HCV envelope antibody responses in individuals at high risk of HCV who resist infection. These antibodies may be a factor that helps these individuals resist HCV infection.

We are also obtaining data on antibody responses in a small cohort of patients and at-risk individuals as follows:
? Studied broad cross-genotypic antibody responses in clinical cohorts, their epitope targets and clinical associations. Showed patients with broad neutralizing responses usually target multiple epitopes and they are associated with lower rates of fibrosis and may predict slower disease progression. 
? In collaboration with Dr Paul Kellam (University of Cambridge) we are investigating the diversity of immunoglobulin repertoire in acute and chronic infections using next generation sequencing methods. In parallel, we plan to set up assays to measure B-cell repertoire (from patients at different disease stages and infected with different genotypes) at the functional level (manuscript in prepatration).
? Studied neutralising anti-envelope antibodies in unifected individuals that are repeatedly exposed to HCV (in collaboration with Matthew Cramp, University of Plymouth). This is a unique cohort of individuals who resist HCV infection despite repeated exposure. We showed that a subset of individuals produce neutralizing anti-envelope antibodies which may contribute to host immunity. Further exploring regions targeted by these antibodies may yield novel epitopes for vaccine design (manuscript published).

Molecular simulations revealed that these mutations disturb the distribution of core conformational preferences, which is likely related to the modulation of infection kinetics. Together, these data highlight the plasticity of core domain I conformation and illustrate the relationship between its structural tolerance to mutations and virus assembly and virus spread.

Recently, we reported a single mutation (Y35A) within domain I of JFH1 core that disrupted its interaction with the cellular RNA helicase DDX3 and that this virus-host interaction is dispensable for HCV replication. Here, further mutagenesis of domain I of core identified two JFH1 mutants (G33A and F24A) with unique phenotypes that were unrelated to the core-DDX3 interaction. Following transfection, the G33A RNA replicated efficiently yet the extracellular and intracellular infectious virus titers were reduced by approximately 2 logs, indicating that this residue is important for infectious virus assembly. During serial passaging of cells replicating this mutant RNA, we reproducibly observed the reversion of virus infectivity to WT levels. Moreover, this increase in infectivity coincided with compensatory mutations arising in close proximity to the original G33A substitution. In contrast to the G33A phenotype, the F24A mutant achieved peak infectious virus titers similar to WT following transfection. However, the infection kinetics of the released virus particles was substantially reduced, indicating a defect in virus spread.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Immune functions of hepatocytes</gtr:description><gtr:id>6E8AB1C5-61E4-440D-BF68-15D75A0817DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication: PMID - 17726521; 15780065</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>B29BA200F32-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided insights into the immune functions of novel human hepatocyte cell lines generated in our lab</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provision of novel human hepatocyte cell lines</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Texas</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Health Science Center at Houston</gtr:department><gtr:description>Application of MAb AP33 in histochemistry</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7098DDC-8B57-4E29-8394-DE5B8AA169A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our work was presented at the United States &amp;amp; Canadian Academy of Pathology Meeting in San Diego, CA, in March 2014.

Further studies on hightroughput sequencing of data patient biopsies have revealed interesting information. Briefly, HCV gentoype (gt) 1-infected biopsies displayed elevated levels of transcripts regulated by Type I and Type III interferon (IFN), including genes that predict response to IFNa therapy. In contrast, genes controlled by IFN? were induced in gt3-infected biopsies. Moreover, IFN? levels were higher in gt3 samples compared to gt1 and control biopsies. Analysis of hepatocyte-derived cell lines confirmed that the genes up-regulated in gt3 infection were predominantly induced by IFN?. The distinct interactions of the two viral genotypes with hepatic cells may explain differences in the progression of disease pathology and treatment response under both IFN-based treatments and novel direct acting antivirals. A separate study demonstrated the presence of anti-HCV envelope antibody responses in individuals at high risk of HCV who resist infection. These antibodies may be a factor that helps these individuals resist HCV infection.

We are also obtaining data on antibody responses in a small cohort of patients and at-risk individuals as follows:
? Studied broad cross-genotypic antibody responses in clinical cohorts, their epitope targets and clinical associations. Showed patients with broad neutralizing responses usually target multiple epitopes and they are associated with lower rates of fibrosis and may predict slower disease progression. 
? In collaboration with Dr Paul Kellam (University of Cambridge) we are investigating the diversity of immunoglobulin repertoire in acute and chronic infections using next generation sequencing methods. In parallel, we plan to set up assays to measure B-cell repertoire (from patients at different disease stages and infected with different genotypes) at the functional level (manuscript in prepatration).
? Studied neutralising anti-envelope antibodies in unifected individuals that are repeatedly exposed to HCV (in collaboration with Matthew Cramp, University of Plymouth). This is a unique cohort of individuals who resist HCV infection despite repeated exposure. We showed that a subset of individuals produce neutralizing anti-envelope antibodies which may contribute to host immunity. Further exploring regions targeted by these antibodies may yield novel epitopes for vaccine design (manuscript published).

We explored the potential of cyclic peptides mimicking the AP33 epitope structure to elicit anti-HCV antibodies. Antibodiess that specifically
recognize a cyclic variant of the epitope bound to soluble E2 with a lower affinity than other blocking antibodies and do not
neutralize virus. The structure of the complex between one such antibody and the cyclic epitope, together with new structural data
showing the linear peptide bound to neutralizing antibodies in extended conformations, suggests that the epitope displays a conformational
flexibility that contributes to neutralization escape. Such features can be of major importance for the design of epitope-based
anti-HCV vaccines (published PMID:26819303).

In the first patient (pt100), samples from before and after the negative viral load, purifying selection was evident at multiple positions with HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2. Amino acid changes were observed outwitwith the known receptor-binding sites. An unexpected observation was that no positive selection was present within the previously well-described E2 hypervariable region 1 (HVR-1) - this region is the most extensively described target for neutralising antibodies in patients with acute HCV. It seems highly likely that there are neutralising antibodies targeting regions outwith of HVR1 and this forms the basis of further study. In the second patient (p56), the viral load never became undetectable but did drop by &amp;gt;1log10. The level of selection estimated across E1 and E2 appeared to be higher than that in the pt100. An amino acid change V313I was present within the same fairly conserved region of E1 as R317H in p100. This may well represent evidence of a previously undescribed B cell epitope. Again there was very little evidence of selection occurring within E2 HVR1.

Further studies on hightroughput sequencing of data patient biopsies have revealed interesting information. Briefly, HCV gentoype (gt) 1-infected biopsies displayed elevated levels of transcripts regulated by Type I and Type III interferon (IFN), including genes that predict response to IFNa therapy. In contrast, genes controlled by IFN? were induced in gt3-infected biopsies. Moreover, IFN? levels were higher in gt3 samples compared to gt1 and control biopsies. Analysis of hepatocyte-derived cell lines confirmed that the genes up-regulated in gt3 infection were predominantly induced by IFN?. The distinct interactions of the two viral genotypes with hepatic cells may explain differences in the progression of disease pathology and treatment response under both IFN-based treatments and novel direct acting antivirals. A separate study demonstrated the presence of anti-HCV envelope antibody responses in individuals at high risk of HCV who resist infection. These antibodies may be a factor that helps these individuals resist HCV infection.

We are also obtaining data on antibody responses in a small cohort of patients and at-risk individuals as follows:
? Studied broad cross-genotypic antibody responses in clinical cohorts, their epitope targets and clinical associations. Showed patients with broad neutralizing responses usually target multiple epitopes and they are associated with lower rates of fibrosis and may predict slower disease progression. 
? In collaboration with Dr Paul Kellam (University of Cambridge) we are investigating the diversity of immunoglobulin repertoire in acute and chronic infections using next generation sequencing methods. In parallel, we plan to set up assays to measure B-cell repertoire (from patients at different disease stages and infected with different genotypes) at the functional level (manuscript in prepatration).
? Studied neutralising anti-envelope antibodies in unifected individuals that are repeatedly exposed to HCV (in collaboration with Matthew Cramp, University of Plymouth). This is a unique cohort of individuals who resist HCV infection despite repeated exposure. We showed that a subset of individuals produce neutralizing anti-envelope antibodies which may contribute to host immunity. Further exploring regions targeted by these antibodies may yield novel epitopes for vaccine design (manuscript published).
