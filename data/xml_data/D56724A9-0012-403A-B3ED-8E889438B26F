Participatory research addresses issues that are important to people and includes their views and experiences. Many positive claims are made about the general process and outcome of participatory research, but there are some specific areas which have not received much attention. This seminar series has two broad aims. Firstly, to critically examine the unacknowledged or underexplored tensions and challenges to what might be considered full or genuine participation by people with learning disabilities in research. In addressing this aim the seminar series will explore and critique the arguments relating to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>whether and how people with learning disabilities can participate in data analysis&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what is possible in relation to developing innovatory participatory methods for involving people with high support needs in research.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The second aim of the proposed seminar series is to seek to stimulate innovative developments in methods by synthesising the achievements in relation to participatory research methods with people with learning disabilities and acting as a catalyst for thinking and action in the two identified areas needing development. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most direct beneficiaries of this research during its life course are those who participate in it, which will include:

- people with learning disabilities who do research
- people with learning disabilities who are involved as self-advocates, sponsors, reviewers, commissioners and users of research
- people who support people with learning disabilities to be actively engaged in research and advocacy work.

Also closely linked in time and space are those people with learning disabilities who participate in research about them and their lives conducted by seminar participants during the process and soon afterwards. Our intention is that such participants will enjoy greater and more meaningful involvement in that research because of the growing capacity (particularly methodological and conceptual confidence and competence) gained through engagement with the speakers and involvement in the workshops. Moreover, participants with profound and multiple impairments and high support needs, who would have been excluded previously as 'too hard to reach' and engage, will begin to be involved in participatory research at some level. 

In the longer term, the seminar series outcomes will stimulate further debate, research and capacity building and broaden this kind of impact to greater numbers. Moreover, developments in the field should reach policy makers and funders of research whose horizons may be expanded by greater understanding of the potential for research to be inclusive and the potential for involvement in research to meet other social and civic engagement goals.

The final seminar dedicated to knowledge transfer with participatory researchers working in other domains, such as with children and young people, or with older people, is intended to enrich the impact further. This will enhance the civic engagement in research not just of the target group of people with learning disabilities, but of other groups with whom participatory research is gaining ground and valued as important for their social inclusion.

Also going beyond the immediacy of impact, a crucial factor is not just the direct benefits for those connected with participatory research, but the indirect benefits for others because of the findings from such research. This is likely to include research in the crucial fields of education, health and social care and to include people with learning disabilities, their families, and people providing support. The capacity of service providers to be inclusive of people with learning disabilities is likely to be enhanced by research that is rigorous and inclusive and that generates findings that have been shaped and influenced by the key stakeholders at the heart of it. Thus the impact of these seminars will extend to touch people's quality of life and well-being as well as push the boundaries of public engagement with research and policy development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18146</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newsletter article in professional magazine called Learning Disability Today</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9C79B933-4C65-495C-BB39-54BA3D9DC9EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Learning Disability Today is a newsletter and website for professionals in health and social care who support people with learning disabilities to live independent lives: https://www.learningdisabilitytoday.co.uk/ldt-home/

The ultimate goal of participatory research is to enhance the quality of life of people with learning disabilities by producing research that informs and improves the quality of support they receive to live meaningful lives. One of the main ways in which this research can contribute to such an impact is building the capacity of people with learning disabilities, practitioners and academics to conduct participatory research that pushes the boundaries of what is understood about the lives and experiences of people with learning disabilities. We began this capacity-building during the seminar series through the active engagement of people with learning disabilities and other stakeholders. This capacity-building work culminated in the final seminar where we invited participants to share their particular participatory research problems with seminar participants, and through group problem-solving begin to identify potential solutions. As part of this final seminar we also sought ideas for how we might capacity-build beyond the seminar series. There was strong consensus that an online co-produced participatory research 'tool-kit' that developed and maintained practice-focused information would be a valuable resource. Seminar participants resolved to seek further funding, for example through impact accelerator funds to explore this avenue further. A follow-up survey of participants revealed that the seminars had an impact on those who worked within learning disability services, revealing evidence of intention to change or develop practice:

&amp;quot;We have spent some considerable time discussing the methods we learned about, and thinking about the theory. It is a complex topic and we have to take a 'one step back two steps forwards' way of working to ensure all of the group are present in the discussion, which only reinforces the topics of discussion which we had around participatory research time-frames needing to be much more flexible&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Currently exploring .. using drama -based participatory research.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;It has really been a personal encouragement and has affected the way I write.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;We work as a coop so we talked about it all and decided together to make research part of our next business plan&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>658D44A2-54B2-4552-9E56-A791BAA1CA0D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544bff99f01352.06634526</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award transferred to ES/JO2175X/2 when the PI moved to Exeter University and gained an extension. At the end of the extension the following results were reported:

The discussions across our five seminars focused on three main questions:

1. Can people with learning disabilities engage in participatory data analysis with people with learning disabilities? If so, methods, tools and technologies can facilitate this participation? This was mainly answered in the second seminar on participatory data analysis. All the projects that were presented used familiar qualitative methods to collect data including: videos; interviews; focus groups and observations. The methods used to make analysis of the data collected from these methods accessible to people with learning disabilities varied, however. Some projects largely used standard coding and thematic analysis techniques, other projects used less familiar analysis methods (e.g. research circles or comic strip conversations). The methods used though did illustrate how it is possible to push the boundaries of participatory research with people with learning disabilities by replicating familiar processes of data analysis in challenging contexts. What enables this to happen is the detailed attention paid to the provision of appropriate support and structure. This can be very time consuming. Although participatory data analysis is possible, there can still be a tension between making analysis simple enough to be accessible and retaining the complexities needed for meaningful qualitative interpretation. We found that developments are happening in layered approaches involving both these dimensions simultaneously or sequentially. Academic researchers taking the first stage of analysis before opening it out in more inclusive way was, however, politically sensitive for some. 

2. Can people with high support needs be meaningfully included in research? If so, what innovative and flexible methods, tools or technologies approaches can be used to enable their participation? This was mainly answered in the third seminar in which a range of creative, sensory methods to engage people with high support needs in research were described, including: mobile interviews, visual and multimedia methods. These projects pushed the boundaries of participatory research with people with learning disabilities by developing nuanced processes that fitted the context in which they were being implemented. These processes were continually developed throughout the course of the project and sometimes led to data that would not have otherwise been generated. According to some definitions, however, projects that involve people with high support needs might push the boundaries of what would traditionally be considered research. Nonetheless, a significant contribution that such projects can make is in the calling of these boundaries into question, opening up new debates about the many forms that research might take and the possibility of new advocacy-research hybrids.

3. How might participatory research with people with learning disabilities both inform and be informed by participatory research in other areas such as children and older people? The seminar series identified that a number of issues that are transferable across different fields of participatory research. There was agreement that participatory research takes a lot of time and resources but can improve the quality of research. There were also some common principles for good practice such as: the sensitive provision of training and support for co-researchers; engaging in a rigorous process; valuing each other and learning together. We were able to identify a number of models for capacity building in participatory research and to raise awareness of some conundrums in the domain of training lay researchers while retaining their lay perspectives. Participatory research across the different fields faces challenges moving forward, particularly with regard to focusing attention more on the outcomes of the research than the process, about which there is now a good body of knowledge. There is a sense that participatory research is pushing boundaries, opening up new spaces and in doing so moving into a new phase. This 'second generation' of participatory research is growing into something weightier and more informed by critique.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We envisage that the academic community will take our findings forward with regards to continuing to scope the boundaries and focus of the next generation participatory research. One key group within this community are doctoral students who are taking up the challenge of pushing the boundaries with regards to creative and flexible methods. This scoping work will need to include sharing examples from the seminar series with ethics committees and funders in order to push the boundaries of what is considered possible or desirable in research with people with learning disabilities. There also key implications for support workers (and the services they work within) with regards to the kind of nuanced, flexible and sometimes structured support that is required to enable people with learning disabilities to push the boundaries of what is possible through their participation in research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6ACB01AD-EFAE-4E02-A6F1-E7192CE46E26</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544c0101871937.87275128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
