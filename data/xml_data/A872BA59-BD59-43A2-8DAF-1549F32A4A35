However, the ear is also able to receive information from the brain and modify its function accordingly (top-down modulation). Whilst the mechanisms of top-down modulation and its role for hearing are still poorly understood, it is commonly assumed that top-down modulation plays a role when listening in noisy environments like a cocktail party. It is conceivable that top-down modulation depends on prior sound exposure or the cognitive state of the listener. The aim of this research strand is to investigate the mechanisms of bottom-up auditory processing and its interplay with top-down modulation. Some of the proposed projects will use modern brain imaging methods to investigate how information about sound features such as musical pitch or sound location is represented in the human brain and how these representations are affected by what we heard previously. Some projects will investigate how top-down modulation affects the function of the inner ear, where sounds are converted into brain signals. These projects will use perceptual experiments and different non-invasive physiological measures to probe inner ear function.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Auditory signal processing consists of two stages. At the first stage, which is presumed to occur mainly at sub-cortical levels, the auditory system has to extract the informational components of the incoming signal to process perceptual features, such as pitch, sound location or phonological identity. At the second stage, which occurs at the level of auditory cortex, this pre-processed information has to be represented in a way that makes it accessible to higher-order cognitive processes, such as attentional selection or memory storage. In the auditory system, both the information-extraction and the representational stage of the processing can be influenced by top-down, or efferent information. Understanding afferent auditory signal processing and encoding mechanisms and their interplay with efferent modulatory influences is a crucial prerequisite for gaining a better understanding of auditory disability of both peripheral and central origin. 
The aim of this research strand is, in the first instance, to investigate afferent and efferent mechanisms of auditory signal processing in normal human listeners using both behavioural and non-invasive neuroimaging methods (EEG and fMRI). In the second part of the project, we will then explore, how these mechanisms change with aging, whether or how they can be influenced by non-invasive neuro-stimulation techniques, and how they are affected by cognitive processes such as attention or learning.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>556000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_00010/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
