The ability to monitor one's own thoughts is termed &amp;quot;metacognition&amp;quot;, whereas the ability to monitor others' thoughts is termed &amp;quot;mindreading&amp;quot;. The intuitive view of metacognition described above has led some (so-called &amp;quot;two systems&amp;quot; theorists) to claim that distinct psychological mechanisms underpin metacognition and mindreading, and that metacognition is evolutionarily and developmentally prior to mindreading. 

This claim is disputed by another group of (&amp;quot;one-system&amp;quot;) theorists who argue that mindreading and metacognition actually rely on exactly the same core psychological mechanism (despite common intuition), and that metacognition actually emerged as a by-product of the evolutionary need to mind-read others. Two-systems theorists use two potentially powerful arguments to support their view. First, they argue that non-human primates are capable of performing well on tests of metacognition even though such primates show little evidence of mindreading ability. Second, they argue that humans with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show intact metacognitive ability despite impaired mindreading. 

If these arguments are validated, then this would rule out the one-system view of the relation between mindreading and metacognition. However, one-system theorists have challenged these arguments, claiming that (a) the supposedly metacognitive tasks that non-human primates perform well on do not, in fact, require metacognitive awareness, and (b) people with ASD *do* show metacognitive impairments. There is, however, very little empirical research to decide between these arguments and counter-arguments. Therefore, the aim of our proposed research is to test these theories in a systematic fashion by employing multiple kinds of metacognitive task across two sets of experiments.

In the first set of experiments, we will manipulate the demands of metacognitive tasks in systematic ways to establish whether the kinds of task used to test metacognition in non-human primates really do require awareness of one's own thoughts. Neurotypical adults will take part in this set of studies.

In the second set of experiments, we will assess metacognitive monitoring among adults with ASD and neurotypical adults who are closely similar to participants with ASD in terms of age and general intelligence. We will use a variety of tasks, including those kinds that are used to test metacognition in non-human primates. 

Together, these experiments will allow us to decide between the competing theories of the relation between metacognition and mindreading. In addition to supporting theory development, our proposed research will be important in understanding the nature of cognitive functioning in people with ASD. It is striking how little research there is into metacognition in ASD, given that many hundreds of studies that have explored mindreading in this disorder. Indeed, difficulties with such *self*-awareness might explain aspects of the behavioural features of ASD that difficulties with mindreading do not so easily explain (e.g., behavioural inflexibility). Thus, we hope that our proposed research will, in the end, have practical benefits for people with ASD, by informing teaching practices and intervention efforts designed to enhance learning and cognitive-behavioural functioning among people with this disorder.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH AND HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT?

In addition to benefiting academics, we believe the research has the potential to offer translational benefits. For example, metacognitive monitoring ability is a significant predictor of educational achievement, *independent of IQ*. If metacognition *is* impaired in ASD, then the potential benefit of the research for educational techniques is high; we know there are established techniques for improving metacognitive skills, and that such training enhances academic attainment among other groups of under-achievers. Similar techniques could be employed among individuals with ASD. If metacognition is *not* impaired in ASD, then this would suggest that educators should utilise this ability in classrooms more frequently than many do. Indeed, there are established techniques for enhancing metacognition even among individuals who are not clinically impaired in this respect. Indeed, the Irish government has been influenced by research into the impact on academic outcomes of metacognitive training. As a result, training teachers to teach metacognitive skills is now a component of the &amp;quot;Equality of Challenge&amp;quot; initiative that the government has introduced to enhance educational attainment among children with special educational needs (SESS, 2009). We hope that our research might contribute to a similar government-led initiative in UK schools. To achieve this impact, we will relay our findings to colleagues in the UK Government's Department for Education and the National Autistic Society. This will ensure that our findings are disseminated to the relevant groups at a national level, which will maximize the impact of the research. According to research by the National Autistic Society, only around 12% of intellectually able individuals with ASD secure full-time employment post-education. Although it would be implausible to suggest that this was solely because of educational under-achievement, we do suspect that such impairments contribute to difficulty in finding/retaining employment. Thus, in the longer term, the research has the potential to improve life chances among individuals with ASD, and to enhance occupational functioning and employment prospects for people with this disorder, with the potential for resultant economic benefit. 

WHAT WILL BE DONE TO ENSURE THEY BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

We will ensure successful knowledge-transfer to all user groups by: 

1. Publishing the results of the study in high-impact academic journals (with &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; open-access options) that have a wide
readership
2. Organising a workshop on metacognition in ASD at the National Forum for Neuroscience in Special Education
3. Presenting to parent and teacher groups at schools/colleges for people with ASD
4. Writing an article for publication in &amp;quot;Communication&amp;quot;, the National Autistic Society's members' magazine
5. Publishing an article in the Clinical Psychology Forum of the British Psychological Society
6. Disseminating our results to Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators via our contacts at the Department of Education

TRACK RECORD

Over the past five years (2009-2014), the applicants have published 39 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact (top 10%) journals between them, including in the prestigious Behavioral and Brain Sciences, Psychological Bulletin, and Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. This indicates our capacity to disseminate the results of the proposed project in high-impact journals. In the past three years, Dr Williams has organised two symposia on ASD, aimed at diverse audiences including academics and non-academics. The applicants have a consistent track record of maintaining close contact with schools, colleges, and support groups, and providing copies of papers to participants and other relevant parties. This confirms the capacity of the applicants to deliver impact via dissemination to non-academic users and to host the proposed workshops</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>278648</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Much of the research is ongoing, although very important findings appear to be emerging. Currently, the only published empirical finding relates to metacognitive monitoring in children with autism (Williams et al., 2017, Autism: International Journal of Research and Practice):

In two experiments, participants answered general knowledge questions and provided confidence judgements about how likely each answer was to be correct, after which feedback was given. Finally, participants were retested on all questions initially answered incorrectly. Usually, neurotypical people who are very confident that they know the answer to a question will be correct, whereas low confidence about knowing the answer usually results in an incorrect answer being given. This ability to introspect one's own states of knowledge is termed &amp;quot;metacognition&amp;quot;. Interestingly, when people feel very confident that they know the answer, but the answer turns out to be wrong (a high-confidence error), they are much less likely to make the same mistake again than if they were not at all confident that their answer would be correct (a low-confidence error). This is termed a &amp;quot;hypercorrection effect&amp;quot;. In Experiment 1, we found that metacognition (accuracy of confidence judgements), but not the hypercorrection effect, was related to neurotypical people's ability to understand other people's states of mind (&amp;quot;mindreading&amp;quot;). Importantly, mindreading is well-known to be impaired in autism spectrum disorder. In Experiment 2, we found that metacognition, but not the hypercorrection effect, was diminished in children with ASD (relative to neurotypical children). In other words, children with ASD found it more difficult than neurotypical children (of equivalent age and intelligence) to distinguish when they did know an answer from when they did not know. However, they were just as likely as neurotypical children to show the hypercorrection effect. 

We have also published a theoretical paper in Philosophical Psychology regarding the &amp;quot;metacognitive nature&amp;quot; of epistemic emotions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We know that metacognition contributes significantly to educational achievement (independent of intelligence) among neurotypical children, and that children with ASD systematically under-achieve in education. Supporting metacognition in ASD may enhance learning outcomes among people with this disorder. We are currently working with teachers in local schools to make them aware that metacognition is likely to be impaired in many children with autism and to provide them with strategies to support this ability within the classroom.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>767CD19D-4365-4FB3-9B3A-15B5DF0F7BBF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc3976a9c7b8.17122345</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D9E58E79-E899-4C70-AEA0-A0B56A1578B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Self-Reference Effect on Perception: Undiminished in Adults with Autism and No Relation to Autism Traits.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0fe2284a905df1936f472c417f5fd697"><gtr:id>0fe2284a905df1936f472c417f5fd697</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams DM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1939-3806</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcb3cb29cf6.95531112</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D21F725C-7A8C-4FB7-B23F-63AA8FBF9BA6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metacognitive monitoring and the hypercorrection effect in autism and the general population: Relation to autism(-like) traits and mindreading</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Autism: International Journal of Research and Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6a0cc05f826a21c3919aa32d09e8c7e5"><gtr:id>6a0cc05f826a21c3919aa32d09e8c7e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams, D.M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c9130f9ccf73.70147663</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7D0256E5-12BE-4FFA-8170-682F1DCE8A7B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lind, Sophie E. and Williams, David M. and Grainger, Catherine and Landsiedel, Julia</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/68e8b00e5531887d37fa06eff9fb293f"><gtr:id>68e8b00e5531887d37fa06eff9fb293f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lind, Sophie E. and Williams, David M. and Grainger, Catherine and Landsiedel, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58c9143ebc1881.89178182</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>61B64444-AB2F-4ADF-832A-D0F3044D3BC7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Are epistemic emotions metacognitive?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/620d1e78bb0688d77014d8ed3b09adb7"><gtr:id>620d1e78bb0688d77014d8ed3b09adb7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carruthers P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c94c296a59a6.84985565</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M009890/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
