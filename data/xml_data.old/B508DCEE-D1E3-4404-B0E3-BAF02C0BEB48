health and well-being</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K003372/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The overarching aim of this project is to explore how community representations produced through creative arts practices (e.g. storytelling, performance, visual art) can be used as forms of evidence to inform health-related policy and service developments. Policies for health improvement tend to focus either on the impact of poverty and deprivation - but with little thought given to historical and cultural context or the experiences of living in these circumstances - or on the prevalence of 'unhealthy behaviours', with limited attempts to connect these with meaningful ways of life. However, research evidence indicates the need for studies that explore the experiences of people living in deprivation and isolation and find ways to improve dialogue between communities themselves and health policy makers. This study will develop methods for using creative art forms as a mode of communication and knowledge exchange. Through analysis of existing representations of disadvantaged and stigmatised communities in literature, film, etc, and the production of new community self-representations in arts-based workshops, it will explore the relationship between 'official' representations of community health and well-being (e.g. in statistical data) and how communities understand and present their own health and well-being. There will be a focus on the accumulated assets and resources that allow individuals and communities to cope with and navigate real and perceived structural barriers, and on the possibilities of resilience to upheaval, resistance to reputational damage, and the alternative representations that these can stimulate.

The project will take place across five distinct case-study communities in Wales, Scotland and England and connect these to relevant policy makers, researchers and arts practitioners in each country. Our understanding of community is informed by a 'relational' view of place which conceptualises community as more of a process than an entity. Although we define communities in terms of spaces that are shared, we fully recognise that the meaning of those spaces will not necessarily be shared. The project will consider how perceptions and experiences of community vary across time and changing circumstances, and how communities and the people living in them are represented in relation to key differences and divisions relating to gender, class, ethnicity and age.

Following an inventory and analysis of existing representations of each community, both artistic (e.g. in literature) and 'formal' (e.g. in deprivation indices), each case study will use creative engagement methods (including life mapping, drama, storytelling, and photography) to generate new community self-representations, working in partnership with local arts and health organisations. The engagement process will be documented in ways that allow all participants, though diaries, blogs, or digital soap boxes, to reflect on the process and the dynamics of engagement. In all case studies the final creative representations themselves will be co-authored by the community participants and they will have the final decision on how their own accounts are presented. These new 'data' will be presented to relevant local or national policy makers and service development officials through exhibitions, performances, and digital media. The researchers will evaluate this process, reflecting on the relationship between arts participation and community empowerment, and will examine how community values, participation, self-reliance and resilience are shaped, experienced and articulated, and can ultimately become embedded into policy. Through its rigorous analysis, its development of arts-based research methods, and its conviction that literature and the arts form a valid form of 'evidence' in policy discussions, the research will offer innovative thinking about, and will make a distinctive contribution to, the study and development of 'community health and well-being'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?
National and regional partners and end-users in the three represented countries will benefit. These beneficiaries are over and above the Academic Beneficiaries described elsewhere. In Wales, policy makers and service providers in Public Health Wales, Local Health Boards, Communities First (Welsh Government), the Wales Council for Voluntary Action and the Welsh Local Government Association stand to benefit. In Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at the Scottish Government, Local NHS Boards in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Highland and Glasgow Life (organisation responsible for culture and sport) are anticipated beneficiaries. In England, Local Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS Commissioning Board, Birmingham Health and Well-Being Board, local and national Health Watch organisations and Public Health England are identified pathways to knowledge transfer. Through applying the best principles of community engagement and participatory practice, individuals and communities taking part in the research will also benefit.

How will they benefit?
Individual and communities: All case studies are predicated on the principles of community engagement and participation, as outlined by the Scottish Executive guidelines (2005), to strengthen the likelihood that the experience of participation will be enabling and empowering. Specifically, they aim to provide participants with a voice to express community concerns and mechanisms for influencing decisions and resource allocation within these communities. There is evidence indicating health and well-being benefits of arts participation at both individual and community levels. The cultural impact of communities being able to re-imagine and reclaim stories about their history is a cross-cutting aim. Outputs in the form of artistic production and curating of existing resources will act as a permanent legacy. The research team will identify, in consultation with communities and other partners, suitable geographical and virtual venues for archiving these.
Public and Third Sector beneficiaries: The process evaluations of the case studies will enable service commissioners to gain insight into the lived realities of the communities they serve. For example, Communities First in Wales, a national regeneration programme, has an emphasis on community leadership and engagement as a mechanism for change. Health is one of three strategic outcomes. This research will also provide evidence to support the programme in both engaging communities and understanding the impact of interventions on health and well-being. A similar conversation over what counts as evidence is taking place in Scotland. The CMO for Scotland has a core responsibility to reduce health
inequalities through cross-sector work on the social determinant of health. The 2010 Annual Report of the CMO (Scotland) highlighted the limits of traditional strategies and measurement of salutogenic processes, the factors which create health for individuals and communities. The outputs from the proposed work will support the CMO's task in identifying appropriate forms of evidence, and also NHS boards in the Greater Glasgow and Highland regions, as they respond to the CMO's lead in mainstreaming assets based approaches. More broadly, the work will provide insight and solid examples of culturally acceptable modes of engagement and participation through the arts in populations who experience barriers to arts participation. This will be of benefit to cultural partners in the three countries and health delivery partners wishing to engage with communities they describe as 'hard to reach'.

Reference group
Each country will establish reference groups of critical friends from our partner organisations in academia, creative industries, policy and local communities. They will provide conduits of knowledge mobilisation as well as additional expertise in the practice and/or study of cultural representations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1224306</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A launch event for this case study was held on 1 July 2014. This free event - A Journey So Far: Remembering the Caribbean in Butetown - Past and Present - was developed in collaboration with the National Theatre Wales (NTW), using its Assembly model and with additional funding secured as part of the 2014 Connected Communities Festival. The aim of the event was to:
? celebrate the historical and contemporary links and emotional ties people have/have had to key places in Butetown (the churches, centres, pubs and streets)
? open up space for Caribbean migrants to reflect on the role in their lives of key places and activities in Butetown when they arrived and settled in Cardiff
? enable Caribbean migrants and their children to share the varying impact that Butetown has had on their lives over time and in changing circumstances
? give people the opportunity to share what Butetown means to them today
? explore the Assembly model as one creative, participatory approach to generating evidence about the everyday lives of communities.

In developing the performances, interviews were conducted with each member of the team, and a small-group discussion was also facilitated and filmed. The raw footage was used to help develop a short (15-minute) film on both the Representing 'Butetown' case study (with footage collected by our arts partner, Tara Wyllie of House of Le Fou Film Productions) and the Representing North Merthyr case study (led by Eva Elliott and Ellie Byrne, with arts partner Richard Davies of Forge Films). Additional funding (from a separate University of South Wales fund) was used to commission further editing of this raw footage into five short films. Currently housed on Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/houseoflefou/videos), the films showcase members of the creative team and their roles, providing insights into the Assembly as a method of community engagement.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9250A398-BCA7-4E57-91D4-427F6AA09731</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The short films also reveal the team members' understandings of Butetown, representation, community and belonging. been granted.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b7bb9bad509.86431156</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Whose Butetown: Exploring with local arts pracitioners pathways to engagement and (re) presentation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://vimeo.com/houseoflefou/videos</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Introduction video of The Hodge Hill case study which is part of the Representing Communities: Developing the Creative Power of People to Improve Health and Well-Being.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0ADED017-8F11-4AD2-8D19-77F5DBC39E0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>THe impact of the video is that we presented the video at the Cardiff AHRC funded Showcase event and also are using this video to promote our study and inform the population of our research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54608ed4788690.80866335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Representing Hodgehill</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoSn-NWr7NE&amp;feature=youtu.be</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Digital stories with older people, made from conversations they recorded and images they chose.</gtr:description><gtr:id>60B7671B-2C8D-423B-825E-49DA70B2EBAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A selection of digital stories featured in an engagement event in Merthyr, and they have been released online for public viewing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55ee99feb57fa7.65825153</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Digital Stories: older people</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A documentary film about a music video created by young people in Merthyr</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7FE405E-5C27-4044-98EC-1F722B38AA25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public screening in Merthyr</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55ee9a44edfdf7.28646545</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Merthyr's Big Heart: an introduction</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a 47 minute video which introduces the project for local and academic audiences.

These were expressed through the creation of wall panels, made by Issie MacPhail, using graffiti paint to mist suitable scenes, using stencils created on the spot or local plants, as stencils. This simple, low cost technique for creating 6 core wall panels (c 2.5 m x 3m each), plus 3 supplementary mobile panels on wheels, was chosen to ensure that this embodied form of analysis could be easily replicated in the future, without high costs or professional artist involvement. The process of analysis is described here as embodied because the panels started out blank, apart from their stencilled embellishments. The full range of physical materials created in the course of Representing Cromarty was available in the West Church Hall. We received over 60 'dreams' via our Cromarty Dreaming Post Boxes, located in Cromarty Library and West Church Hall. Through a form of grounded theory these materials provided the headline themes. These are:
? Cromarty Dreaming
? Working on Our Wellbeing
? Our Migration Stories
? The Cromarty We Know
? How Cromarty Cares
? Cromarty Connections
As can be seen in the photos, using Gludots, tracing paper and liquid chalk, magic post-its, drawing materials and actual items from past sessions (2014-2016), co-producers can move materials around and settle upon a final visual summary of what they want to say, and how they want to represent their own strands and experiences, as they relate to these headline themes. This is a departure from our original plan of a docu-drama because we were striving to evade the 'black-boxing' of the analysis process. By making the analysis process into an enormous, physical, scrap-booking process, wherein, through using non-permanent fixings, every item can repositioned (rethought), we created and trialled a visual, collective and physically active mode of analysis and synthesis. Hence this was theatre and performance, but of a far more subtle and inclusive kind, with no audience, only players. The 'town-wide' exhibition aspect was created through having 2 exhibition/ activity venues; outdoor panels in 4 locations and activities involving journeys between and around these, some of which were GPS tracked. The open ended nature of this process reflects the principles of deep mapping, in cautioning us not to close off the conceptual journey, but to instead insist on maintaining and respecting the manner in which this weaving of meaning and place, and the participants' emplaced co-creation of modes for achieving, or striving for, adequate forms of personal and collective wellbeing, persists on into the moments after.

No strings attached, so in whatever fashion, style or focus I wanted. In some respects, this was a dream commission and in some ways it was quite difficult. The brief 'to create any video you want related to Butetown' lead to days of a creative block, angst about how good or bad and artist I am and a load of reality checking.

I am used to having a more definitive brief, 'Make a film about the regeneration of the Butetown shops' and I can easily slip into a convention. That convention being to shoot a few interviews of people talking about how great it is, have someone talk about 'the Old Bay', shoot the icons, The Flats etc and capture footage showing how diverse the community is. It feels that a mixture of these conventions plus a few others including black and white photos and footage of how Butetown/Tiger Bay used to be are the standard Butetown Videos, what the commissioner and the artist expect.

Now I'm not suggesting that what I have created is radical video art but these are radical for me, in terms of fighting against the conventions mentioned above. And as some one from the community these conventions feel deeply in engrained into my psyche.

So after days, possibly weeks of thinking about what I should create I decided that I was going to take my camera out walk around Butetown and shoot what I saw, the things I see everyday as I go about my daily business. I had no set plan and I hoped to shoot instinctively, trying not to over analyse. My brief to myself was to represent the everyday through my lens.

After getting home and beginning to edit I realised that I wasn't interested in showing iconic buildings, I wasn't interested in the myths and legends and wasn't interested in showing the diversity of the community because all of this has been well documented. I was interested in the everyday, the unseen, the uncelebrated.

I went out the next day to capture more images, I decided to choose a prime lens (one that doesn't zoom) which is best for medium to close up shots, so the technology would limit the type of shot available. I continued to shoot the details that interested me as I walked to streets.

The three events of 2014 that this work would pivot around were the centenary of World War 1, the Scottish Referendum, and the Commonwealth Games. Glasgow played a central role in these activities and, as an offshoot of our work on how communities are represented (and may represent themselves through art), Dennistoun was an opportune test site for the work. 
Artists (James Gow and Emma Nutland), film maker (Basharat Khan) and creative writer (Eleanor Thom) were employed to capture experiences and help to facilitate community members' vision of their experience of living in Dennistoun in 2014. Reflections were sought on what 2014 had meant to them, as well as descriptions of how things had changed in the last 12 months.

Welsh West Indian Film Producer at House of Le Fou Film Productions, dedicated to representing communities, with an interest in queer culture, race, youth empowerment, and Welsh identity.


Taking the knowledge, experience, and lessons learnt from working for companies in TV, film, and the arts, House of Le Fou Film Productions was created by Producer/ Editor Tara Wyllie. Since being established she has worked with a diverse range of clients from producing comedies for BBC Cymru Wales, to short films championing equality and diversity for Diverse Cymru, whilst still at her heart is a determination to give communities a voice, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved creatively and aesthetically in fiction, documentary, and beyond.

Le Fou Productions played a major role in the work undertaken in the first year of the life of the case study. Tara's work with the Project to date includes capturing video interviews with members of the Assembly creative team, as well as the editing and producing or a short 'collective conversation' with the team exploring views of representation, community and belonging. Also captured were their views on the Assembly model as a method of community engagement. Tara also produced a film charting our engagement work with one of our community partners and their views on our work, and on the 2014 Assembly. The resulting film (Re) presenting African Caribbean Elders Society (ACES) can be viewed here. Liz Chambers, Director of Photography, captured a series of digital pictures providing another layer in which to chart the work that took place; they are spectacular</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>- fostering of a partnership with a young, local film maker

? Can these methods be developed as part of an evaluation tool kit?
? Would be very powerful if juxtaposed with other forms of data- eg statistics
? Not to conflate qualitative research and artistic processes. Let the art speak for itself.
? Draw out local area for improvement
? Arts power is in changing attitudes and physical change follows. Pay attention to how attitudes are being shaped.
? Makes the invisible visible.
? How did the process affect the researchers? Did it change our attitudes particularly around connectivity, community and risk?
? Too take care how we 'present' the research as this in itself will shape identity.

Maps of Hodge Hill and Mirpur, Pakistan were used to stimulate discussion of migration and place attachments, and participants were asked to write short blurbs about what particular places meant to them. 
This activity generated interest in some community members, enabled us to disseminate information to local stakeholders (e.g. the local councillor), helped with recruitment of interviewees, and enabled us to connect with other local projects in the area.

During the first session it was discovered that none of these medical and lab science researchers had encountered any discussion of epistemologies and ontologies during their academic careers. This means that no matter how much they like what arts and humanities researchers are doing and agree with the need for research on those topics they have no conceptual framework with which to understand how that might relate to their own research - or how it could be considered to be serious research at all. Our aim is hence to continue these talks on a quarterly basis with the aim of helping everyone attending to 'map' their own research positionality, and related methods, through a broader understanding of the history of science, medical science and social sciences allied to a discussion of the challenges posited by Hanlon et al for collective creation of a civically engaged fifth wave in health policy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464ba89773e79.93161632</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reporting from Cromarty: Scones and Stories</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A73932AA-862E-47EF-BBA6-C525A6177DB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intergenerational workshops (4), teaching Youth Cafe young people to use video for oral history work, and to help the community elders fill in Informed Consent Forms.

The final product was a film that was launched (alongside a pop-up photography exhibition) in the local arts centre and attracting 80 people. In promoting the film, Simon Campbell stated

Carnival celebrations will kick off early in the Bay when a week of special events starts on Monday, 24th August, with the screening of a new film, Butetown Carnival Memories. The film features video footage and photography from Butetown carnivals spanning five decades, some of which has never before been seen in public. The screening will take place in the heart of the community at the HUB cinema at CCHA @ LOUDOUN, Bute Street, Cardiff, CF10 5HW, from 6.30pm to 8.30pm and some light refreshments will be provided. Immediately after this event a photographic exhibition, Carnival Memories, will be unveiled at Butetown Community Centre, 40 Loudoun Square, Cardiff, CF10 5UZ. Sounds, food and drink will be available and both events are free. I would like to thank the people who have helped these two events come to fruition: Roiyah Saltus for her ongoing support through the University of South Wales and their Representing Butetown project, who funded the making of the video; Nasir Adam,\ from CCHA @ Loudoun, for supporting us and allowing us to use the venue for the film's first screening; Carole Fox and the rest of the Butetown Community Centre staff for their help and support; Keith Murrell for digitising the carnival tapes and Anthony Campbell for editing the film; The Black Film and Video Workshop in Wales whose foresight and hard work resulted in much of the Carnival being filmed and photographed in the 1980s</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd7610b5a6e1.65283182</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVENtPtK8iQ</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference Session Chair: Archiving Matters - True North Conference 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43014A26-0969-4C9E-8B8B-7225DC13B328</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference Session Chair: Archiving Matters: a round table discussion on archiving values and practices with presentations by Lewis-based artist Jon MacLeod, Referendum Curator Amy Todman, artist Nicky Bird, and Timespan's Archive Development Manager Jo Clemens.

The aim is create a space for carnival goers to reflect and share their thoughts on what the Butetown Carnival means to them. Voice is a vital element of the installation and our aim is to foster a space where people can share stories, recollections and memories of importance to them. These voices represent individual and collective understandings of the role and significance of the Butetown Carnival that we feel are meaningful and of value.

Of the many visitors, 16 interviews were captured and 10 postcards containing the memories of carnival goers were completed. The interviews will be transcribed and analysed with the aim being to explore notions of belonging, wellbeing and community. The interviews will also be included in a forthcoming social documentary on the Butetown Carnival being produced by a small community film organisation.

This was achieved by mentoring the key conference organiser; facilitating community contacts; showing how to embed arts, music, social enterprises and local history groups/ museums into the core programme and advising on technical and production issues and providing skilled contacts to deliver on these elements as part of the team. 

My intellectual contribution, via my introductory speech for Professor Richards keynote session, focused on the pivotal importance and potential of being part of an academic community at for rural dwellers at a local, regional and global levels. My key phrase fro this was 'the importance of kindly intellectual provocation'. 

The papers presented at the conference were also of relevance to the Representing Cromarty case study.

A very successful event was delivered - it generated extremely good feedback, including high praise for the arts and community aspects being so fully embedded within the event and the fact that gave a different feel and intellectual experience compared to standard academic formats. The key organiser and helpers feel equipped to 'go it alone' next time. 17 secondary school pupils attended the keynote speech alongside 92 academic delegates. Others speakers, including the keynote, drew upon and expanded upon the idea of 'kindly intellectual provocation' in exploring the more contentious aspects of the programme which challenge prevailing explanatory tropes of Highland history.

This free event - A Journey So Far: Remembering the Caribbean in Butetown - Past and Present - was developed in collaboration with the National Theatre Wales (NTW), using its Assembly model and with additional funding secured as part of the 2014 Connected Communities Festival. The aim of the event was to:
? celebrate the historical and contemporary links and emotional ties people have/have had to key places in Butetown (the churches, centres, pubs and streets)
? open up space for Caribbean migrants to reflect on the role in their lives of key places and activities in Butetown when they arrived and settled in Cardiff
? enable Caribbean migrants and their children to share the varying impact that Butetown has had on their lives over time and in changing circumstances
? give people the opportunity to share what Butetown means to them today
? explore the Assembly model as one creative, participatory approach to generating evidence about the everyday lives of communities.

Over 130 people attended the event, held at Portland House, Cardiff Bay. All attendees were asked to share seven words that encapsulated their thoughts on the evening, and these included: 'Great night, when's the next one?' and 'Bloody brilliant'. Blog entries and a summary report will follow shortly. We will continue to work with NTW.

Date: 26 June 2015
Venue: Corys Building, Bute Street
The Lens brought together photographers/artists from Butetown and further afield, who have made this community a focus in their work. The aim is to bring together those living and/or working in Butetown, as well as those in the history, heritage and arts sectors, to re-ignite conversation on the many ways in which Butetown has, and is being represented.

&amp;quot;Representation is always already inadequate to the real that it seeks to inscribe&amp;quot; (Rosalind Morris, 2010)

Representation is a tricky thing. Spivak uses the represent (vertreten) verses re-present (darstellen) to engage with notions of theory and the intellectual and how they engage with those who act and struggle (subaltern). Spivak states that an attempt &amp;quot;to confront them is not to represent them, but to learn to re-present ourselves.&amp;quot;

I would argue that re-presentation is the property of all, but as researchers or artists we may not always have the specific means, be they specifically cultural, social or otherwise, to interpret the different prospective ways in which people re-present themselves. According to Spivak representation is seen as &amp;quot;speaking for (as in politics) and re-presentation as in art or philosophy&amp;quot;. In short, for research, representation is (as Morris says) already inadequate to the real and according to Spivak re-presentation potentially allows us to show something of ourselves (often through our silence, the gaps and what we do not/cannot say).

We hosted an event called 'Representing Butetown: The Lens'. Five interviews were conducted with different photographers in Cardiff (various locations) and Newport. The interviews were edited into a short video piece and the photographers were invited to exhibit and talk about some of their work with members of the Butetown community.

I'd like to talk a little about how I developed the video. The point of doing the interviews in the first place was to get an idea (as an outsider) about ways of engaging. The work of capturing the interviews became an artistic opportunity in itself when I made the decision to work with a handheld camera to explore visual aesthetics, ways of seeing and by extension, ways of viewing, by deliberately playing with extreme close-ups, for example. As a result, two things were crucial to the video: 1) what they were saying and 2) how they were seen.

Why was the visual aesthetic and deliberate manipulation important or even relevant to the aim of the project event?

One of the key themes about representation that seemed to be cropping up in our brief analysis of the footage was the notion of wanting to create 'honest' portraits, spontaneous, not posed. There seemed to be a desire to capture the glimpse of a reality - how we are, how we were? Stuart Hall says in his concession to realism that the images in Picture Post were documentary not art. As with the Picture Post and their Wartime Britain images, the images sought to capture the facts of this-is-what-happened and also to evoke the experience of having been there.

In many ways, I was interested in playing with the 'art of documentary' or rather, pushing the boundaries of the documentary video to make apparent (through an art process), the facts of the experience. To expose, not just the orations but the reality that these individuals were talking and responding to me and that I in turn, was observing and listening to them. The visual play was also an attempt to encourage the viewer to have that sense of the intimate that I experienced.

At this point I will add that this justification for the product that emerged does not dismiss the possibility that the visual choices for some, may have had the opposite effect than those intended (that is, distraction and unease) or that had I only depended on my 2nd camera placed uncompromisingly on a tripod, that the interviewer presence would have been obliterated. Again, I place emphasis on the word 'play' in art and experimentation and ways of pushing conceptual ideas into practice.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd74842b63f0.48483747</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC5QX_MmZq4</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>My Cromarty Dream &amp; Cromarty Dreaming Post Boxes</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C4FDE61-BB03-4E80-9767-38111AF503B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My Cromarty Dream - Cromarty Youth Caf&amp;eacute; activity, collaging dreams.

Impacts have been uneven as it depends on the local, regional and national policy contexts in which the case studies were embedded. In terms of national policy it should be emphasized that there are different policy and legislative entry points for our research methods and findings to take root. 


Individual level change for participants

Some aspects of the impact of our work we anticipated. For example, already knowing the effect that arts-based methods can have, we suspected that the research might have deep impacts on some individuals. Whilst this depended on the activity (and not all of them were successful) people who participated in arts based activities told us they had moved, sang and danced with a confidence and a sense of agency they had lacked before. For some young people taking part in photography research told us it had changed the way they perceived their community and its landscape. For other people it created new opportunities for people to experience the arts. Two participants, following the theatre event in Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, The People's Platform, were involved in a performance piece supported by National Theatre Wales (with the National Theatres in England and Scotland) entitled We're Here Because We're Here which remember those who fought and died in the first day of the Battle of the Somme. 

Some participants told us that taking part in the research had contributed to their mental wellbeing, and that it had been an important part of their lives. Following her involvement in interviews, photography, and storytelling, for example, one young migrant mother in Dennistoun has gone on to do a Masters degree in journalism at a local university. People learned new skills, developed their social networks, gained insights into their community and created high quality art which was, in some cases, professionally exhibited, performed or screened. Some activities have directly developed skills. For 15 community members in Merthyr Tydfil were provided with facilitation as part of The People's Platform which they have gone on to use in other settings. 

In Cromarty, several co-producers who are not accustomed to involving themselves in community activities have very much enjoyed being able to use these creative methods as a means to express and discuss both difficult and joyful aspects of their lived experience, anonymously. Certain of these co-producers gradually took on an organising role in some elements of activity, as a result of this. The collective approach enabled through the principles of co-creation made overcoming language barriers such as having little or no English, in discussing and exploring 'Our Migration Stories', far more achievable, and that sensitive outreach work, aimed at quiet inclusion, was conducted by co-producers themselves, who were new to that kind of role in the town.

The Representing Butetown project allowed local artists to find ways to move beyond the standard response to attention from outsiders - researchers included. An example of this is series of short films produced by a local visual artist produced at the end of the project where he explored his relationship with the area extent freed (to a notably extent) from the constraints of producing an alternative representation of the area. Rather he drew on his arts practice to imagine his home in his own way, for his own purpose. It is important to note that our work and impact is linked ongoing work taking place in the area, in particular the work of National Theatre Wales who in the three years prior to the start of the project has conducted a series of public assemblies. We launched our project with an Assembly and we were able to work closely with the local artists who had worked with NTW. 

In Hodge Hill, Birmingham, pupils in a school affected by the Trojan Horse controversy were provided with an opportunity to express themselves and they created a powerful and authentic counter narrative to media portrayals through the creation of 52 poems that are currently being printed in a book. Copies of this book will be presented to each child in the school and to local schools in the area. Once distributed we plan to work with the schools in the local area to see how this set of poems can contribute to the local school curriculum. 


Impact at the Community Level

At a community level, the impact of the research must be considered alongside other work happening in the areas in which we work. Impact was deeper and more extensive when we worked alongside other partners. Some activities, and subsequent impact, were only possible through collaborations with organisations and projects such as local schools, community centres, social clubs, libraries, museums, theatre companies, and other arts organisations, cultural venues and projects. Co-funding with partners such as POSSIB (a bilingual arts project in Wales) added value to other arts based activities, performances and events. We were also able to co-fund a Photovoice project, which trained young people in photographic techniques. With POSSIB, co-funding has meant we could also enhance the creative options available for the People's Platform, engaging a diverse creative team who not only ensured that the production was of the highest artistic standard but also meant that we could fund their extra support for people in the community who wanted to perform or participate in some other way (set as set building and design). 


Representing Butetown were able to capture community-level responses via is facebook page (360 members). The responses to the various exhibitions and events were largely focussed on those who were involved from the community, the very public and collaborative nature of the event or activity, and space given for community representations. For example, responses to exhibition showcasing all the key encounters of the study housed at the Cardiff Museum:


Response: It's all about the location though - it is in the heart of the community and although the wall is not perfect it is also integral to the exhibition ... It was risky/brave to place the pictures where they can easily be reached but the visual and emotional impact is far stronger because of it ... What we do may draw some negative responses but that is part and parcel of the community also?
Response: Yes, agree the visual impact is fantastic and the emotional significance really does say 'this is Butetown' . Just a shame that not all will have the same pride in the beauty of such a community. Well done though to everyone. Going to check it out today.?


In some cases, as academic institutions, we have been able to apply for additional funding to produce collaborative pieces of work for our mutual benefit. For instance, as an off-spin of the Representing Dennistoun project, Impact Arts applied for and was successful in being awarded &amp;pound;10,000 from the National Lottery's Celebrate fund to explore the impact of this significant year in Glasgow's history in the East End, with particular focus on Dennistoun. It concentrated on capturing the community's experience of the Commonwealth Games, the centenary of WWI, and the Referendum. This enterprise was brought together with a photography project taking place in Dennistoun by Eoin Carey and Paula Morgan entitled Washing Lines.The aim was to capture the changing nature of Dennistoun's social landscape and to help forge a new identity for the area through photography. Eoin and Paula wished to depict images of Dennistoun's residents with their washing, alluding to 'the barriers to social interaction in the urban environment and a response to the changing fabric of community'. Glasgow Open House Exhibition took place in 2015 and the impact of Washing Lines was wide-reaching with the story of the project featuring on an STV Glasgow late bulletin news programme on April 21st 2015.


The impact that we have brought to our partners is noteworthy. We have funded activities such as creating digital stories, connecting with other communities via messages in bottles, banner making, music, film making, photography, song writing and recording, drama and performance. All of these activities have enriched learning and have helped institutions broaden the range and quality of their usual practice. The photography project in Merthyr for instance directly contributed to several young peoples' Art GCSE. In Dennistoun there are similarly impressive impacts on partner institutions. The team responsible for the refurb of Glasgow's Burrell collection have sought advice and guidance on engaging with communities adjacent to the Museum inspired by Representing Communities activity. 

One key impact that Representing Dennistoun has had is on Dennistoun Library and the wider organisation in which it sits, Glasgow Life. In December 2014, the local research team brokered a partnership between Impact Arts and Dennistoun Library that saw the library turned into Narnia for the day. This event brought people from a wide range of backgrounds into the library, some for the first time (more than 400 people attended the event over a three-hour period). It transformed the library into a different kind of space, expanding the scope of what a library could be or represent. One of the senior managers of the library told us that the collaboration we helped to foster 'is probably a bit about survival for both the organisations because libraries at the moment in the current climate, we don't have a lot of staff. We don't have a lot of resources. We wouldn't be able to put on a big event like that on our own. So it's amazing for us to work with a local actual organisation, who can come in, build all these things, work so flexibly with us to make it happen. But then we can offer them a real true community venue for that event to happen.'

During the life of the Representing Butetown case study a new organisation - The Bay Archives - was established. Rooted in over 30 years of community arts activism, the aim of the organisation is to preserve the collection of films, photographs, oral history interviews and other collections collected by local community members. A one day a week artist-in-residence within the organisation between 2015 - 2016, the linking of encounters as part of the work of the organisation and the structure that underpinned such work (e.g., weekly meetings, funding allocated directly to the organisation) were important in helping to establish this organisation and the work it is now set to do.

In Hodge Hill we have been able to work with a local organisation (The Unity Hubb) who had opened its doors in a newly renovated church in 2014. Through holding many activities in the church space including a one day &amp;quot;Games for All&amp;quot; community event we were able to facilitate the introduction of this new space to the majority Muslim community and ease fears and rumours that this space would not be used. The space is currently a well-used facility in the community.


Films were an important medium for highlighting the forms of activity, and spaces for positive interaction, for older people. In Merthyr Tydfil these have been used directly as evidence to, for instance, Public Health Wales, of the importance of activity groups for social inclusion and increased social interaction. In Dennistoun films are being used for this purpose by other organisations such as the Library Manager at Dennistoun Library.

Cromarty residents who are members of the Highland 'Evidencing' Health and Wellbeing Group, created by the Representing Cromarty team, reported that they are impressed and delighted with the extent and demographic diversity of participation amongst residents. In particular, they are hugely impressed to find that the approach taken has engaged most fully with residents who do not normally engage in community development processes, and has drawn in such a broad age range too, through a twin-track focus on 'the elders' and young people. A key observation, in this discussion, is: 'Quiet people are the stabilising backbone of community - deep mapping has got their voices 'heard''. The health sector and third sector members of this group are excited about the potential of a deep mapping based approach to bring together diverse, qualitative and quantitative sectoral evidencing practices in a meaningful and effective way, to save time and facilitate easier sharing and use of information. Some of this group also hope that this might be a route to breaking down language barriers to participation and self-realisation, and to counter stigmas perpetuated through certain health sector nomenclatures. One such co-producer, inspired by her experiences in this project, has created a monthly Classic Film Club with and for elderly residents in an entirely different village, outwith the case study area. The venue is rotated round members' houses and attendance is arranged using car-sharing and Community Transport. A maximum of 48 people can be accommodated. 

The decision made by the Representing Butetown team to foster formal partnerships with Cardiff-based heritage, archive and museums meant that we were able to write into these agreements collaborative engagement that brought people and groups together over the course of the project. Now that the project has ended some of these connections remain intact and are developing. For example, Bay Life Archives, a Butetown-based community archive has established links with Glamorgan Record Office who has given a undertaking to support and contribute to a HLF grant application to develop the archive. The partnership work and permission to mount a public exhibition along the railway wall that runs along Bute Street has led the Company's interest in playing a more active role in the community and moreover, in extending (in space and permission to use the wall) the exhibition. 

Lastly, working with community members and organisations closely and collaborative has led to shifts in our positioning, the approaches we used and the projects we are asking our university to support. One example is the proposed studentship rooted in exploring the role and value of leisure for migrant elders (dominos) that is currently advertised.



Policy Impact 

Local

Our impact at a wider level has also been noted. Both the methods and findings of the Representing Communities have been picked up by local authorities and other public bodies. 

In November 2016 the research team in Dennistoun gave a presentation to Glasgow Life and the discussion revealed a general consensus that the methods and theoretical framework of Representing Communities offered an important contribution to thinking about the responsibilities of cultural institutions have in holding and promoting certain stories and how this becomes a particularly relevant in choices made by cultural institutions around what they collect for the city. There was also discussion of how stories could be used to inspire more creative data collection methods beyond questionnaire data. Mark O'Neill, Glasgow Life's Director of Policy and Research emailed the team later to offer further support for the project. Relationship with Glasgow Life continues to develop a mutual research agenda across institutions around culture and health using learning underpinned by Representing Communities research.

In Merthyr Tydfil the local research team have developed relationships with Merthyr Tydfil Local Authority, and were invited to contribute to their understanding of wellbeing and the development of wellbeing objectives in relation to the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act (Wales) 2015. The group at the local authority includes the Chief Executive, several Heads of Service and Chief Officers, and colleagues in Performance, Finance and Communication. The impact we have on their practice is at the time of writing unknown, although Ewan McWilliams, Corporate Performance Manager, informed us that our research 'is going to make an invaluable contribution to our [LA] understanding or wellbeing in Merthyr Tydfil. My team and I will use (and reference) the work you have done, drawing out key messages to inform our wellbeing objectives. This will show the connection between the work you do and its influence over the strategy of the local authority.'

High Life Highland's Black Isle Youth Development team report that because of their significant involvement in the Representing Cromarty work they have changed how they evaluate the success of youth activities. Previously they based that on numbers attending. Now they seek to routinely incorporate ways of finding out how activities affect participants' articulacy regarding wellbeing issues and how activity programmes affect participants' sense of personal wellbeing. They have requested the creation of a simple Handbook of methods used in our project work as a resource for them to draw upon in their own future work. 

As a result of involvement in this project, the new Cromarty Care Project, developing and delivering flexible, locally sourced, home care, are interested in being supported and assisted to use a personal co-created Scrapbook based method for care monitoring and evaluation. The idea is that carers and clients use this together to track and describe needs and related actions. It is hoped that this might be of particular value for clients with dementia.

In Hodge Hilll, at the beginning of our work, we did not find an infrastructure of arts based activities. Attempts at engagement with the Pakistani community with the arts had resulted in a view that the community were not interested in arts based activities. Through our grounded bottom up work where we worked with the community itself to develop culturally appropriate arts based activities we have been able to demonstrate through the creation of a range of activities such as poems, a play, a wall hanging that there is an appetite for arts based activities. Within the area we are seeing a slow rise in arts based activities taking place. 



National Policy and Legislation

In Wales we have established links with the National Assembly of Wales and Welsh Government as well as arts institutions such as National Theatre Wales. Talking about one of our engagement events (a film screening and arts and photography exhibition) in June 2015, Kevin Davies, Senior Outreach Officer, said: &amp;quot;What I loved about the engagement you delivered was that it was co-owned, co-produced, engaged key decision makers and people from the local community, and that those who participated gained new skills (like film making, photography, researchas well as knowing they elected representatives that can support them). I'm currently in the process of writing the Assembly's public engagement strategy for the 5th Assembly, and I have referenced the work that you have delivered in several conversations around how we can engage the people of Wales in the work of the Assembly, and the democratic process on a broader level. This will no doubt influence the way we design our activities in the future.&amp;quot;

In terms of the impact on arts Phil George, the new Chair of the Arts Council in Wales, highlighted The People's Platform in an article on his vision for the arts in Wales. He wrote 'There's a well-lit mini boxing ring with a fighter training; a washing-line monologue about a mother and her teenage son. Issues are raised which stimulate discussions at tables around the club lounge. It's called The People's Platform and it's focused on celebrating the people of this feisty, talented and massively disadvantaged town. I'm there as the new Chair of the Arts Council of Wales. But why do I begin this piece with this scene, with this story? Well, because in these confused and anxious days after the Brexit vote, it needs to be said that all over Wales, artists and arts organisations are building community and civic life just when we need it most, just when we're seeing that disconnect between people in the street and the institutions that shape public life. Far from being icing on the cake or an optional extra, the arts are creating a culture of aspiration, opportunities for self-expression and opening up horizons for young and old alike'. (Western Mail, 16 July, 2016).

In addition, as the project has progressed, we have established and deepened links within a wider arts and culture organisations and with universities interested in learning more about the area. A member of the Butetown team is now conducting an evaluation of the WMC's project Tiger Bay Tales and is also hosting in April 2017, a groups of Sociology students from Birmingham University whose visit will include a walking tour of the area by local historian, Neil Evans which will include the public exhibitions co-created with local photographers. 


In Scotland the research team have engaged productively with the NHS Health Improvement team for North East Glasgow, Glasgow Life (museums, libraries, and art galleries) and elected members of the Scottish Government as well as local arts organisations based in the east end such as Impact Arts and Platform. An email from the Director of Glasgow Life pointed out our aligned interests: 'I think your research may be creating an intellectual framework for a lot of our work. The institutions we run - arts venues, libraries, museums and sports centres - and the events we organise -are all stories about Glasgow, its aspirations, its sense of itself and how it imagines the lives of its citizens. They also tell the stories of the people of Glasgow - though we have a long way to go in being representative. We struggle in a lot of our work to work with the negative realities of large scale poverty, ill-health and poor education and our role in 'creating better stories' which are not just spin.'

Discussions about the implications of this work, in Scotland, have been held with constituency MSPs, Maree Todd and Ivan McKee. They are hosting our Parliamentary Reception and Exhibition, in Autumn 2017, through which we will move this conversation onto a national basis. 

Materials such as those on mental health, derived from analysis of rural fiction, are being used as a basis for a series of 'Nature Works' Campfire Conversations, linked to the UK wide Campfire Convention, launched last year by Pete Lawrence. Issie MacPhail is a founding member: http://campfireconvention.com/ She attended the inaugural event with Professor Woodward from University of Newcastle.

In Birmingham, Birmingham City Council, The Place Directorate set up &amp;quot;The Community Intelligence Network&amp;quot; and invited Dr Fazil to be a member, she regularly attended these meetings during 2015 and she gave a presentation of the Hodge Hill Case Study research findings.

National and International Initiatives

Via the Director of Public Health and Public Health Policy, NHS Scotland, the Representing Cromarty team have been approached by the Scottish UNESCO Geoparks, to lead and advise on the development of a 3 stage study into wellbeing in Scottish UNESCO Geoparks using the method of deep mapping. Stage 1 involves co-creating a deep mapping approach suited to use in Scottish UNESCO Geoparks in Scotland, with health sector, Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry Commission and community stakeholders. The aim is that in Stage 2 this will be used and tested in 3 Geoparks in Scotland so that UNESCO Geoparks themselves, and the various sectoral participants, can align their policy approaches to generating wellbeing in outdoor environments, for residents and visitors, according to the findings. The final co-created model, founded on co-production via deep mapping, will then be rolled out across all UK UNESCO Geoparks. In Stage 3 a comparative study and co-produced project is planned with 3 continental European Geoparks and three in China.

Camille Dressler, Chair of The Scottish Islands Federation, who is also Chair of ESIN (European Small Islands Federation) has approached the Representing Cromarty team with a view to including a deep mapping process in a later iteration of the SMART ISLANDS INITIATIVE process. The SMART Islands Declaration (Smart Islands Brussels Event: Creating New Pathways for EU islands) is due to be launched on 28th March 2017 in Brussels. It 'is a bottom-up effort spearheaded by island authorities that communicates the need to tap the significant, yet largely unexploited potential of islands to function as laboratories for technological, social, economic and political innovation'. The process is currently very quantitative and Camille would like us to help ESIN, and other actors in the SMART ISLAND Initiative use deep mapping to transform towards including qualitative and action research methods too.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B4A07830-7A45-4B72-8556-1F7407F5B783</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dff534e73bd7.99219411</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Arts methods can provide knowledge of the everyday understandings, management and practices of wellbeing:

Across the study the project has managed to capture community based understandings, practices and performances of wellbeing in five different places. Arts based approaches to working with communities made the familiar strange to community members themselves, and the invisible visible to other publics, policy makers and professionals. Thus the potential of arts based approaches in articulating the possibilities of transformation were evident. The study also blurred the distinction between the creativity held by artists and the creativity inherent in everyday encounters and places of significance. The art speaks for itself but also generates different kinds of conversation and debate about what wellbeing is, how it can shape public health and wellbeing and what approaches might be used to understand emerging wellbeing concerns and possibilities. 
 
Wellbeing is supported in subtle ways and through semi-formal structures of care:
Stories and portrayals of wellbeing are revealed in the forms of sociability and 'community beingness' that are available to different groups of people, whether these are in a domino club, a luncheon club or outside the local shops. For older people, in particular, these provide opportunities to acknowledge memories and journeys as well as affirming future possibilities. However people also talked of the warp and weft of everyday care. Gentle signposting and the careful nurturing of confidence and skills performed by community workers suggested that these forms of street level care are a form of 'craft' work. 

Reputational damage hurts and can work many ways:
The study focused on representations and in finding ways of managing, challenging or countering these. Existing representations were by not always rejected and the community groups we worked with differed in terms of how they viewed narratives from both the past and the present. The project succeeded in generating insights of everyday wellbeing that are hidden from formal representations. The research process itself turned 'reputations' into a live issue that had to be managed carefully. Communities were suspicious of how we would handle these and could be wary of any attempt to make 'visible' narratives that were not crafted carefully. This raises ethical issues about what constitutes legitimate silencing of what is seen and heard. Researchers themselves also came with baggage as outsiders who will promise much, deliver little and disappear soon. 

Co-production requires collective skills of knowing when to step up or step back:
Our primary concern was to place community members centre stage, with the cultural authority to generate their own insights into community life. Working as a researchers across disciplinary boundaries with artists required a considerable amount of learning and skill in terms of when to hand authority over the research process to others. It was important to recognise when an artist had superior skills in crafting an insight with a community group and at other times it required a recognition of an artist's imposition on a community's group's cultural authority. Co-production involves the sharing of different skills, knowledge and resources throughout the process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We would argue that pathways to impact depend on good partnership working in terms of developing research activities and new ways of working. We found that in working with, and alongside schools, cultural organisations, libraries and other public bodies generated conversations about our methods and findings that scaled up an understanding of our methods and findings within the organisations. In relation to policy it helped to understand the concerns and priorities of local and national government in order to identify the opportunities to contribute to their own objectives. In particular the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 has provided a local and national vehicle through which the methods and findings relevant to the well being goals can be used. In terms of communities we feel that working in co-production through the sharing of ideas, resources and knowledge creates new knowledge spaces in which multiple voice can participate (community, policy, academic and arts).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4BC95B8B-012A-4EB3-ACAE-55AFDF430D9D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56debe040d9540.61279642</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities
