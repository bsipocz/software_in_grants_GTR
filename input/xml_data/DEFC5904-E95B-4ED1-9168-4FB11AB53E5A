Executive functioning refers to the higher-order cognitive skills required for novel tasks with no well-learned patterns of responding.&amp;nbsp; Recent theoretical approaches have suggested that brain regions implicated in EF show abnormalities in children with SLI.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Forty-one 8- to 14-year-old children with SLI were assessed, along with 31 children who had less severe language difficulties (low language functioning, LLF) and 88 typically developing comparison children (6 to 14 years).&amp;nbsp; Carefully chosen measures of EF involved some tasks that required language and others that did not.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Children with SLI (and LLF) showed difficulties with EF in many areas, including:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>processing and storing information concurrently (working memory)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>generating new ideas (fluency); inhibiting prepotent motor activities (inhibition); and categorising complex materials (planning).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Such wide ranging EF difficulties were not confined to tasks requiring language, and have important implications for educational strategies and academic development in children with SLI and other language needs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>223809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article on executive skills in children with language difficulties for an Education magazine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F6F73E5-2081-4A03-BDEA-AB3BAC2CEEE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This magazine, PIR Education, goes to all schools in the UK and led to several emails with requests for further information.

Children with &amp;quot;specific language impairment&amp;quot; (SLI) have difficulties with most or all aspects of language (e.g. grammar, vocabulary, literacy), so it is a much more serious disorder than dyslexia. Nevertheless, those with SLI do not have low IQs on non-language measures. Nor do they have an identifiable reason for their language difficulties such as poor hearing.

Academic research has produced two contrasting theories to account for SLI: (1) there is a specific deficit in one or more of the processes that deal with language; and (2) there are wider difficulties with particular forms of thinking and reasoning, which produce language problems, whilst leaving other abilities unscathed. 

The current project tested these alternatives. We assessed five higher-level thinking and reasoning skills (&amp;quot;executive functions&amp;quot;), but were careful to include a matched task in each case: one task in each pair required language; and the other did not. Our samples included 40 children/young people with SLI; as well as 80 typically-developing children with no language difficulties. 

The results clearly favoured the second theory. Children/young people with SLI had marked difficulties with four of the five &amp;quot;executive&amp;quot; skills, regardless of whether the tasks required language or not. These impairments in higher order thinking and reasoning have direct consequences for remediation, suggesting that interventions should target both language and non-language based thinking and reasoning for optimal results. 


Objective 1: Were there were impairments in executive functioning (EF) in children/young people with SLI?

There were many executive difficulties in our sample of children/young people with SLI. These individuals found it difficult to remember information whilst doing another task (working memory) and generate examples/ideas around a theme (fluency). Planning new solutions for novel tasks was also impaired; as was inhibiting unhelpful responses. All of these impairments were in relation to the chronological age-matched comparison group; there were no significant differences in EF performance when comparisons were made with children of similar language age. There was one area of EF in which those with SLI were unimpaired: they were perfectly able to switch attention between tasks; or change strategy when required. Therefore, children/young people with SLI demonstrated chronological age-relative executive difficulties in the following areas: working memory; fluency; planning; and inhibition. 

Objective 2: Were these impairments in EF in relation to both verbal and non-verbal assessments, or were they specific to verbal assessments, reflecting language weaknesses?

There were no major differences in the results depending on whether the executive tasks were verbal or non-verbal. For working memory, fluency, inhibition and planning, deficits in performance relative to the CA comparison group were found for children/young people with SLI, regardless of whether the tasks were verbal or non-verbal. These results supported the proposal, that young people with SLI have extensive difficulties with both verbal and non-verbal executive tasks compared to peers of the same age. In other words, broad deficits in &amp;quot;executive&amp;quot; higher order thinking and reasoning, rather than a specific deficit in language-related executive skills.

Objective 3: Were different aspects of executive functioning linked to different facets of language skill, namely vocabulary and grammar? 

In the SLI group, performance on many verbal and non-verbal EF tasks was significantly related to assessments involving vocabulary and grammar. The findings concerning non-verbal EF tasks were particularly interesting as these were unlikely to be directly influenced by language abilities. The performance of the SLI group on most non-verbal EF tasks was significantly related to vocabulary, and the performance on non-verbal fluency and inhibition tasks both were significantly correlated with grammatical abilities. This raises the possibility of impairments to basic information processing capacities, which influence both executive functioning and language. There were also indications that the SLI group had an undifferentiated set of EF and language abilities compared to the CA group, whose language and non-verbal EF skills were less closely associated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academics could carry out research on implementing newly developed training packages, aimed at improving executive skills in children/young people with language impairments. Training could focus on two or three aspects of executive functioning (working memory, fluency and possibly inhibition) delivered in short, easy to administer twice-weekly sessions; and the resultant impact on executive skills/language/scholastic achievement could be assessed.

Practitioners (teachers, Speech and Language Therapists, Educational Psychologists, language charities) could focus on identifying individuals with language difficulties who have additional problems with executive functioning. Further, tackling such difficulties with higher order thinking via interventions or compensatory strategies may help children and young people with language impairments get the most out of their educational provision and achieve their full potential.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3B25EFFD-C54F-4ACD-BDE3-74A114D8B69B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2740832038.913697b2f01bfa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3831E26A-B0D1-42EE-AB62-A7FC17644391</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigating
