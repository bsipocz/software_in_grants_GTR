We will establish a PER working group led by a Senior Academic Lead from the office of the Principal and commit to appointing academic leads for PER in at least 3 Schools within the 12 months of grant activity, one of which will be in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. Our longer-term goal is to have PER included in School strategies, policies, structures and processes. 

Related to this we will create a network for professional services supported by developing a PER training workshop tailored for support units in association with National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE). A key aim here will be to establish, in collaboration with researchers and university support units, a common language and sense of purpose around PER including forming institutional definitions in the field of PER. 

By assessing the level and appropriateness of training provision for PER we will identify any gaps in delivery and immediately act to fill these, creating a rounded offering of PER and PER related training presented as a portfolio of public engagement (PEP). This will be coordinated by our Centre for Academic, Professional, and Organisational Development (CAPOD) and will be integrated into externally recognised and well established 'Passport' programmes of staff development. Training will increase the quality, sustainability, and visibility of PER in the institution. Working closely with CAPOD we will strive towards external recognition for our suite of training. 

We will further encourage the quality of PER by engaging external partners including the creative community through the university managed Byre Theatre. The Byre Theatre hosts many of our PER activities involving diverse audiences from schools to research festivals. Part of this collaboration will include an external evaluation of cultural consumption trends and the needs of resident and transient audiences in our rural location, both engaged and disengaged in activities. Results will allow us to determine the most accessible and relevant delivery methods and to identify under-served populations. 

An important strand in quality will focus on ethical dimensions of PER. While some very robust work has been published in the areas of patient and community participation, we will focus on wider delivery and evaluation, investigating when PER becomes advocacy and how this impacts on delivery and trust in public engagement. A further area of interest will be in ethics of evaluation methodologies. This will result in the creation of a set of guidelines we will encourage to be adopted institutionally and offer as a resource to the wider PER community.

We will also strive to embed PER as integral to research and research careers, working with relevant professional services to include PER in job descriptions, performance reviews and promotion criteria. 

Further, we will establish a set of internal awards at an annual internal PER conference while continuing to pursue recognition for high quality activities through external awards. Bursaries will be made available for researchers to present PER activity at either specialist subject or PE conferences. 

Evaluation throughout this project will give us a greater understanding of resource needs (time, costs and staffing capacity) to sustain high quality, relevant, and accessible PER. From this we will present a renewed business case for University investment in PER. 
Ultimately, the project aims to create a culture of high quality engagement with dynamic governance, an increased knowledge of resource, and higher levels of recognition for PER activity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project will have a wide range of impacts, on researchers, professional services within the university, cultural and delivery partners, audiences, and anticipated impacts on best practice relevant to the wider field of public engagement with research (PER). We will have a fully integrated approach to evaluating the programme, its impact on these groups and their impacts on each other. 

Because of the nature of the project, we anticipate a great deal of the impact will be on researchers, staff, and students across the institution with further impacts on those audiences interacting with our public engagement projects, and on partners within these projects. We will effect a deeper understanding of PER delivery in researchers and supporting units which, alongside interventions leading to a higher quality of PER delivery, will positively impact upon audience engagement in terms of diversity, accessibility and relevance of activity. We also anticipate the range of audiences will be diversified and those currently under-served will be further catered for. We will conduct appropriate evaluation of all activity, and will endeavour, where possible and appropriate, to share evaluation outcomes with respondents. 

By assessing the level and appropriateness of training provision for PER we will identify any gaps in delivery and immediately act to fill these creating a rounded portfolio of PER training. Some of these workshops are core elements in externally recognised professional development pathways such as the Passport to Excellence schemes. We will integrate all PER relevant training opportunities not already listed in relevant Passport schemes with a view to fully integrating them, and look to creating a Passport programme for PER. This training will be extended to professional support staff and their Passport schemes. We will ensure that appropriate training opportunities are identified and made available to further the professional development of PE facilitators and academic leads as well. CAPOD already have a rigorous evaluation system in place that we will use to inform and report on our activities in this area. We will, where possible and appropriate, share evaluation outcomes with respondents.

The ethical dimension of PER in our proposed grant activity has the potential to be far reaching, with impact across the HE sector when it comes to public engagement. Working closely with NCCPE, and having already established further partnerships with diverse community partners including Police Scotland and Fife council as education providers, the results of our ethical analysis will be shared across HE and public engagement networks.

Economic impact will be created in this project by inclusion of a new Centre for Engagement with Research Through the Arts (CERTA) in the support structure for PER provision in the university. This will create new artistic output inspired or informed by research resulting in creative development and diverse funding applications to creative bodies as well as content that will create ticket or art sales in the theatre and beyond. This centre will encourage two-way interactions between artists and researchers. Interactions can, and already are being, initiated by both academic and non-academic stakeholders who are collaboratively creating innovative and impactful engagement outputs. We anticipate this will increase accessibility and relevance to audiences, create a wider awareness of funding opportunities available for collaborative work, and bring about innovation in practice. Awareness of this as a resource will be raised through internal and external media and through the extensive internal and external networks of the CERTA directors including the Head of PE and the Byre Artistic Director, alongside those of artists, researchers and PE facilitators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59110</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R01972X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
