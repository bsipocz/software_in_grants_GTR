Consequently, the plastic deformation properties of a number of key geological materials exert a profound influence on the surface topography, internal structure, and tectonothermal evolution of the Earth and other planetary bodies, as well as having a technological importance in civil engineering projects which are sited on or within flowing media such as ice or salt bodies. The primary source of information on the plastic flow properties of geological materials comes from laboratory deformation experiments. The results of these experiments are employed in numerical models which attempt to describe the natural deformation process of interest. The rates of natural plastic deformation are generally too small to use in laboratory testing, and usually experimental samples are subjected to simpler loading geometries than those experienced during natural deformation. Consequently, if experimentally determined plastic flow properties are to be used with confidence in deformation modelling applications, it is important to establish that the flow properties obtained from laboratory experiments and extrapolated to natural deformation conditions match those implied by field measurements of naturally deforming bodies. Ice is perhaps the only material where such comparisons can readily be made, and in this case it is invariably found that naturally deformed ice is significantly stronger (up to eight times) than that deformed in the laboratory. The conclusion to which many glaciologists have been forced is that plastic flow properties are influenced by the geometry of the applied stresses in a way which has not hitherto been explored in laboratory experiments. Almost all rock and ice deformation experiments have been performed under the special case loading geometries of either pure shear (axial compression or extension) or simple shear (torsion). However, to establish flow properties under general loading geometries it is necessary to perform experiments under some combination of pure and simple shear. We propose to do this by performing a series of deformation experiments at high temperatures and pressures on polycrystalline calcite samples under simultaneously applied axial loading and torsion. The proposal takes advantage of our recently acquired capability (unique in the UK) of performing such tests, and apart from some reconnaissance-type experiments on ice which produced ambiguous results, it will be the first systematic study of its kind. Calcite will be used because among all of the volumetrically significant geological materials, its plastic flow properties are experimentally the most convenient to access, thereby allowing us to minimize the technical and data analysis difficulties associated with the experiments. The experiments will be performed at range of different temperatures using, at each temperature, loading at a range of different fixed ratios of axial strain-rate to shear strain-rate and of axial stress to torque. The programme will focus specifically on establishing the sensistivity of (a) the flow stress at large strain, and of (b) the low strain yielding behaviour to the loading conditions. In principle, the mechanical response depends not only on the loading conditions but also on the extent to which a mechanical anisotropy develops with strain. The rate at which this anisotropy develops depends on the importance of grain-size sensitive deformation processes, and so to separate the effect of the anisotropy from that of loading geometry, the experiments will be performed on two calcite starting materials with widely different grain sizes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>358716</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>To date, the findings have been used primarily within University teaching courses.

mass within the Earth's interior, to the deformation of the polar ice masses and the advance and retreat of glaciers, are 
accomplished by plastic flow. Consequently, the plastic deformation properties of a number of key geological materials exert a profound influence on the surface topography, internal structure, and tectonothermal evolution of the Earth and other planetary bodies, as well as having a technological importance in civil engineering projects which are sited on or within flowing media such as ice or salt bodies.

The primary source of information on the plastic flow properties of geological materials is from laboratory deformation experiments performed at high confining pressures (to suppress any brittle response); the results of the experiments arethen employed in numerical models which attempt to describe the natural deformation process of interest. Unfortunately, the technical demands associated with high confining pressure experiments mean that almost all rock and ice deformation experiments employ the special case sample loading geometries of either pure shear (axial compression or extension) or simple shear (torsion). Yet, on theoretical grounds it is expected that loading geometry affects the plastic response in a way that cannot be systematically explored using only these two types of test. The aim of this project was to assess the significance of this experimental restriction by modifying an existing rock deformation apparatus so as to allow, for the first time, experiments to be performed at high temperature and confining pressure in which axial loading and torsion can be 
simultaneously applied. We ran our experiments on non-textured, polycrystalline samples of calcite, a material chosen because its plastic flow properties are relatively easy to examine experimentally in comparison with other minerals, thereby allowing us to minimize the technical and data analysis difficulties associated with the experiments.

We successfully modified the Paterson triaxial rock deformation apparatus to allow torsion experiments under a 
simultaneously applied axial compressive load. Experiments on calcite samples at 500-650 deg C and 300 MPa confining 
pressure, show that loading geometry, encapsulated in the variable J3 (the 3rd invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor), 
does have a systematic and measurable effect on the flow properties. However, conveniently, the effect is not large and so to a first approximation, plastic flow strength is reasonably well described by a strength criterion proposed by von Mises 
that can be evaluated from axial loading or torsion tests alone. Ongoing data analysis is targeted at examining the influence of J3 on the evolution of plastic flow properties with strain. Our apparatus modifications may be straightforwardly and inexpensively applied to other Paterson apparatus worldwide, and provide the opportunity to examine deformation-induced microstructural changes under more realistic deformation geometries than has previously been possible, thereby allowing a closer comparison with the microstructures observed in naturally deformed rocks. Our experimental methodology may also be extended to characterizing the plastic flow properties of textured geological materials and how these evolve with strain, 
although our experience has highlighted some further apparatus modifications that could be helpfully deployed to address this matter more effectively.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main users of this research will be other academics (primarily earth and planetary scientists) with an interest in the plastic deformation properties of geological materials. This includes (a) geophysicists and glaciologists who use these properties in modelling natural deformation, and (b) the experimental rock and ice deformation community which seeks a better understanding of these properties so that experimental measurements can be more reliably extrapolated to natural conditions. The findings are also of relevance for civil engineers working on construction projects (e.g., tunnelling) sited on or within flowing ice or salt bodies.

The international experimental rock deformation community are the immediate beneficiaries of this research, particularly 
those parts of it using variants of the torsion test to characterize the plastic deformation properties of geological materials. The torsion test has long been the method of choice in the material sciences for investigating the plastic flow properties of materials at room pressure, but its use for geological materials, which require the experiments to be performed at high confining pressures and temperatures to suppress brittle failure, is still relatively new. The practical lessons we have learned from implementing the combined axial loading and torsion test on the Paterson apparatus are of great interest for the other laboratories around the world that have this apparatus; the relatively straightforward and inexpensive modification that we adopted to allow this apparatus to run torsion tests under axial compressive loads drew considerable attention at the 2010 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting. The findings are also a helpful initial step for those interested in moving into the important area of characterizing plastically anisotropic geological materials, in terms both of their microstructural evolution and of the directional dependence of their mechanical properties.

Much of the initial inspiration for this work derived from the work of mathematicians attempting to model the deformation of the polar ice sheets as the ice within them flows from where it was precipitated as snow to the ice sheet margins. That line of research has the twin motivations (a) of assessing the impact of past and present climate change on the polar ice sheets, and (b) of establishing polar ice sheet flow lines so that the location of where the ice recovered from boreholes was precipitated as snow can be determined accurately. The latter point is important because it allows greater flexibility in 
choosing the sites of boreholes thereby enabling regional climate variations to be investigated, and also the use of 
locations where the precipitation rates were higher, and hence where the time resolution in the climate record data is 
better. We think that our findings imply that material anisotropy has a far bigger impact on this ice modelling work than any effect of loading geometry and in publication of our work we will be communicating this point to the glaciological 
community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C445E5F-7E59-4610-A0AA-D599900A86EE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546b80b713bed6.60973667</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3FF281AC-B284-431D-B414-E7CA72005C36</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring the influence of loading geometry on the plastic flow properties of geological materials: Results from combined torsion&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;axial compression tests on calcite rocks</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Structural Geology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/903947ca312e0bc9e415b73e0ed305c3"><gtr:id>903947ca312e0bc9e415b73e0ed305c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Covey-Crump S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d45f2b5d8f6.76683720</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/E014283/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>85</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C6842010-EC71-44DF-B79C-64B1BA9B3BDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mantle &amp; Core Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9C0F9DC0-329C-4C09-B439-E4335EA8F916</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>55</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Properties Of Earth Materials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>401A9A9F-83DF-48FD-B108-C4CC7FB7572C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tectonic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
