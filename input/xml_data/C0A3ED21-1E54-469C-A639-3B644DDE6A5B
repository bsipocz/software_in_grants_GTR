Studying the dust and gas orbiting nearby young stars gives us unique insight into how our solar system might have looked prior to the inception of the planets. This enables us to answer some fundamental questions on our origins. Is our solar system unique? Do young planetary systems contain information on the physical and chemical conditions in the natal protoplanetary disk? Are planetary atmospheric compositions set by the molecular content of the planet-forming zone in the disk? 

We are in a unique era to begin to address these questions. Not only is the Kepler space observatory (now K2) revealing the extreme diversity of exoplanetary systems, we now have tools at hand to map the physical structure and chemistry across the planet-forming region of nearby protoplanetary disks. The primary tool we use for this is ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. ALMA, an interferometer composed of up to 66 antennas, has the sensitivity and spatial resolution to zoom into the planet-forming zone (&amp;lt; 50 au) and reveal the molecular composition of the birth environment of nascent planets. Recent highlights from ALMA include the first detections of so-called complex organic molecules (COMs), molecules consisting of 6 or more atoms which are also thought to be the main feedstock of larger (prebiotic) molecules. COMs also trace the composition of the ice reservoir hosted on cold (&amp;lt;&amp;lt; 100 K) dust grains which are the building blocks of icy planetesimals such as comets. Also revealed via high spatial resolution observations (~0.1&amp;quot;-0.01&amp;quot;) are dust gaps and traps, for which one explanation is sculpting by unseen forming planets. What remains to be determined, is the degree to which dust sculpting can influence the chemistry, thus altering composition of planet-building material (both gas and ice) in situ. 

This project will investigate the chemistry of organic molecules in nearby planet-forming disks. ALMA observations of gas-phase methanol (CH3OH) of our nearest solar-system analogue, TW Hya, will have the sensitivity and spatial resolution necessary to reveal its distribution and abundance. Of particular interest is whether the methanol emission is coincident with the CO snowline (at 19 au) and/or a planet-carved dust cavity (at 22 au). Analysis of the data using detailed chemical models will reveal its chemical origin and provide vital data for motivating future ALMA searches for even larger (and closer to prebiotic) molecules. In parallel, ALMA observations of known molecular disk tracers, CO, CN, HCN, and HCO+, of the protoplanetary disk encompassing HD 100546, will be used to investigate the effects of planet-carved gaps on the disk chemical structure. HD 100546 is a unique test case because it remains the only known source for which an embedded (proto)planet has been detected in the outer disk (~50 au) and for which existing ALMA data have revealed a dust trap external to the location of the forming planet. The new ALMA data, in combination with detailed chemical models, will reveal whether the forming planet has carved a deep gap in the gas structure at its location, and the molecular emission across the gap will reveal chemical changes induced therein and in the dust traps bordering the planet location. This pilot study, on potential molecular diagnostics of planet-carved gaps, will motivate future ALMA studies of nearby protoplanetary disks which may be host to as yet unseen forming planets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact from this work is via public engagement and outreach with the primary beneficiary being the general public. 

ALMA: Revealing Our Origins
**************************************
With its unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution at (sub)mm wavelengths, new results from ALMA are of great interest to the general public. One of its primary scientific goals is to reveal the birth environment of planetary systems, which is the first step en route to 'life' and our origins. High-impact results from ALMA are communicated to the general (and international) public via press releases prepared in collaboration with the ALMA observatory (http://www.almaobservatory.org/) and ESO (European Southern Observatory, http://www.eso.org/public/). These are, in turn, picked up by the international press and are promoted nationally and internationally via social media. Leeds astronomers have been involved in several recent press releases regarding high-impact results from ALMA which have also led to engagement with the press via interviews for publication in international and national online media. It is anticipated that the work conducted during this project will lead to similarly high-impact results of international press interest.

Public Engagement at Leeds
**************************************
The Astrophysics Group at Leeds has a strong track record in public engagement and outreach via public talks, participation in initiatives to promote (astro)physics as a career to under-represented demographics, and the organisation of local public events in collaboration with national events such as BBC Stargazing Live. Leeds astronomers have had several high-impact results picked up by the press (in addition to those from ALMA highlighted above). Results from this project will be communicated to the general public during public talks and outreach events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231819</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R000549/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC478D98-EB7D-4905-B536-D9D61AFD07E4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Galactic &amp; Interstellar Astron</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
