&lt;p>Accordingly, this postdoctoral fellowship will build upon a series of experiments examining the competition-performance relationship, which were conducted during the fellow's doctoral studies. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The results demonstrated that performance was better while enjoyment, anxiety and effort were greater during team competition, compared to individual competition, and to non-competitive conditions. Furthermore they indicated that increased enjoyment and effort caused better performances during team competition. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>A key aim of this fellowship is to publish these results in leading peer-reviewed journals, and to present them at scientific meetings. Another aim of the fellowship is to train the fellow in the use of advanced quantitative methods that will allow him to assess brain activity and eye-gaze behaviour during competition. It is hoped that these physiological measures could provide further insights into the mechanisms which underlie the effects of competition on performance. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, a research grant application will be prepared during the fellowship, based on the research findings and new laboratory skills that will be acquired. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82154</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NWORTH Parkinson's Seminar (open to public)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3ADFFF5B-1C29-418D-B40E-F4A8BE108008</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented grant data and Neurofeedback in Parkinson's proposal.

My postdoctoral fellowship assisted me in securing this position as the training that I undertook as an ESRC fellow equipped me with all of the necessary laboratory skills that are required to complete this new research project. In particular, the EEG processing and analytic skills that I learned during my fellowship are essential for my new role.

UPDATE 2016
Following my research position at University of Birmingham, I secured a job as a lecturer at Bangor University. My employment in the role was in part due to the psychophysiological research skills I acquired during my ESRC fellowship. Since being in Bangor I have developed my mutli-measure psychophysiological approach in research projects with a range of non-academic stakeholders (e.g., English Institute of Sport, NEURODEM Cymru).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D97367DB-A3AD-4BBC-8244-A5B2C21EAEF5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5447ef5f874639.83362287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I was awarded a training fellowship, not a traditional research grant. No new experiments were conducted during my fellowship. Instead it provided me with the following major scientific benefits:

1) I learned how to process and analyse electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to indicate a variety of psychological and motivational processes that occur in the brain.
2) I learned how to acquire, process and analyse eye gaze activity to indicate attentional processes during motor-performance.
3) I learned how to write computer programs to analyse peripheral physiological signals (e.g., the electrocardiogram).
4) I learned how to write computer programs to control psychophysiological experiments.

Taken together, these scientific research have skills equipped me with the tools to undertake ground-breaking research applying advanced quantitative measures including EEG, eye-gaze and cardiovascular activity measures to provide new insights into competition, emotion and performance research. 

My fellowship also provided the following major professional benefits:

1) It allowed me to write-up five manuscripts. All have now been accepted for publication. Accordingly, my publication record and curriculum vitae has been enhanced considerably as a result of my fellowship.
2) I have presented my work at national and international conferences, and in doing so, I was able to network with world-leading academics.
3) I have established a collaboration with Dr. Mark Wilson at the University of Exeter, as a result of my training visit to his institution. This collaboration has already yielded one manuscript, while additional experiments are on-going. I am optimistic that several future papers can materialise from this partnership. 
4) My fellowship allowed me to prepare three grant applications, one of which was funded and thus provided me with employment for the 12-month period immediately following my fellowship end. 

Finally, my fellowship has yielded the following personal benefits:

1) I have become a more skilled and well-rounded researcher as a result of the training that I have undertaken.
2) I have become more experienced and confident when it comes to writing for publication and presenting my work at conferences.
3) I have attended courses and gained publications that will enhance my curriculum vitae and serve to boost to my future employability.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>No new data were
