Extensive work on nineteenth-century popular science has shown how the act of popularization shapes not only public perception of science, but also science itself, as those who practice science seek to control how their work is perceived, and respond to challenges arising from the public response. The current project focusses on the early twentieth century because this was a period in which the professionalization of science had at last become more or less complete. In this sense, the situation changed significantly from that obtaining in the Victorian era, and we should expect to see the origins of the kind of relationship between scientists and the public which has continued through to the present.
The project was developed in order to question the commonly-expressed view that when the scientific community became thoroughly professionalized around 1900, it began to distance itself from any involvement with the general public. The research shows that there were in fact very many scientists writing for (and later broadcasting to) a non-specialist audience, and only a few cases where the profession expressed disapproval of this- usually when an individual was thought to have given up research for popularization. 
The work is intended to throw light on the role played by working scientists, and by those with some scientific training, in providing non-specialist and popular literature on science. Why were they willing to do it, and what did they hope to achieve? Why did they seek to engage with the public, and what image of science did they want to project? How did they learn what was actually needed by the publishers, who were very much the gatekeepers to actual contact with the public?
The project has also been concerned with the involvement of the publishers. Why did they believe there was an increasing market for popular science books and magazines, and what were their target groups in the population? How did they seek to present their publications in a way that would be attractive? In particular, the project has identified a large group of publications where it was seen to be important that the material came from an authoritative source, i.e. a professional scientist. Only at the most popular level was it thought that the expert was too specialized to do the job properly. The research shows how the publishers interacted with scientists in order to get them to produce texts at the right level for popular consumption. They also explore the actual mechanics of commissioning, editing, producing and advertising the resulting books and magazines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30442</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E503624/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
