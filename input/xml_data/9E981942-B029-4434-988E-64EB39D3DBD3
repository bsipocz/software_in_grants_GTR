We did use our work as part of a basis for an application to the British Academy, ' Bullying, cyberbullying, and pupil well-being in schools', featuring UK, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Unfortunately the application was not successful.

The findings from the wider network, including also colleagues from Australia, will feature in an edited book, 'Bullying, cyberbullying and pupil well-being in schools: Comparing European, Australian and Indian Perspectives', which has been accepted for publication by Cambridge University Press. The book will have 17 chapters of which the UK team will co-author 4. The PI (Professor Smith) is the lead editor of this book. It will be published in 2017.

More detailed results may be submitted to academic journals. Due to the delays in starting the project and some extensive pilot work required due to very different cultural circumstances, most data has only been gathered either in 2015 or still continuing into 2016, and most is still being analysed.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BC502302-6601-4EB7-8952-6FAF645186AF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54634af602f319.75370925</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As part of a wider network, the UK team has been particularly involved in two out of 5 themes concerned with bullying and pupil safety and well-being. 
The first is looking at measurement issues around bullying in schools and young people. We were interested in how terms for this in India (in Punjabi, and Tamil) compared with terms in England (and some other countries). To this end we adapted a stick figure cartoon task, previously used in a number of countries, but not before in India. We piloted the cartoons, making some revisions to accommodate to some typical Indian school situations. The cartoon task was given to samples in England and India (2 sites). For wider comparison it will also be given in Australia, Brazil, Lithuania, Russia and Thailand. Data are currently being analysed, and will show the meaning profile of terms. For example in Punjabi, the terms 1.Dhakeshahi, 2.Pange laina, and 3.Baar baar tang karna, will be compared with English 1. Bullying 2. Teasing 3. Harassment. From the 40 cartoon scenarios, pupils aged 14 years say whether (yes/no) each is an example of each of these terms.
The second is a review of anti-bullying work in schools and
findings from a specially designed Bullying questionnaire for Punjabi and Tamil schools. Similarities and differences between the European and Indian definitions of bullying and the types of intervention used to prevent and respond to bullying in these different cultures were investigated. Findings from the Punjab and Tamil Nadu indicate that teachers had witnessed bullying in their schools; but few schools reported any formal anti-bullying intervention and teachers tended to respond to bullying incidents using a variety of sanctions, including involving the principal; meetings with students' parents and exclusion dependent on the severity of the incident. Most Indian teachers wanted more information and resources about bullying and anti-bullying interventions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The 40 cartoon set is on the website and it and the protocol for use are available for other researchers.
The findings comparing knowledge of and use of anti-bullying strategies in England and India can be useful for Indian educators and colleagues in informing school policies on bullying and cyberbullying there. Resources for teachers will be made available on the website as we finalise our analyses and reports.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>02B8C387-7B9C-4CD1-8552-38CC16D86F86</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54634c6d8773e4.72786414</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/cyberbullyingeuindian/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is a short questionnaire designed for institutions training teachers (initially, in India and Europe), regarding the teaching of anti-bullying strategies.

An earlier 25-item set was published, as
Smith, P.K., Cowie, H., Olafsson, R. &amp;amp; Liefooghe, A.P.D. in collaboration with 17 additional authors (2002). Definitions of bullying: a comparison of terms used, and age and sex differences, in a 14-country international comparison. Child Development, 73, 1119-1133.
This revised version both updates (e.g. scenarios for cyberbullying, such as 'Keely tells everyone on Facebook not to talk to Patricia'; and includes scenarios relevant to Indian pupils especially (such as 'Felix sneers at the kind of food Trevor eats'). (N.B. names are changed to suit the culture, UK examples here).
We have used 14-year old pupils though the task is suitable for a range of ages. Pupils are shown each scenario one by one for a few seconds, and are asked to say yes/no as to whether this is an example of X, where X is a term similar to 'bullying' in the language (in English we have used bullying, teasing and harassment as 3 terms).
This will give the meaning profiler of each term across the 40 scenarios, which vary in aspects such as intent, repetition, imbalance of power, mode (physical, verbal, exclusion, cyber) etc.
The results are important for understanding cross-national comparisons. In non-English cultures, 'bullying' will be translated into a native linguistic term. It is important to know how well such terms correspond in meaning to 'bullying'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E352D0CD-D260-4341-A28A-7752338B05B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Besides being used in England and in two Indian sites, the cartoon task is being given in Australia, Brazil, Russia and Thailand.
