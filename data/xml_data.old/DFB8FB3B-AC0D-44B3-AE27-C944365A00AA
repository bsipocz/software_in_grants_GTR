Superfluidity is nevertheless associated with some spectacular large-scale effects, most notably in liquid Helium II, where under the right circumstances the fluid can for example flow up the walls and out from a confining vessel. Superfluidity is observable in a variety of physical systems, and is frequently intimately associated with the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation, where, for certain kinds of identical (bosonic) particles, for low enough temperatures a significant fraction of the particles collapse into the same state, from then on in a sense acting as one. The 1995 observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic vapours, for which the 2001 Nobel prize was won by Eric Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle, and Carl Wieman, thus provided a huge stimulus to the fundamental study of superfluid and related properties. This is in significant part because such dilute vapours are significantly simpler to describe and understand than the much denser systems of liquid Helium or the metals and ceramics in which the related phenomenon of superconductivity is observed. A much more recent, related phenomenon is that of so-called exciton and polariton condensates in semiconductors, with particular interest paid to the properties of the light emitted from such systems.This is an expanding field, with workers on the variety of superfluid and condensation phenomena coming from an equally broad range of scientific backgrounds. There is therefore substantial scope for interdisciplinary cooperation, particularly as a number of seemingly distinct theoretical methodologies, each with its own particular strengths and insights, have been developed independently to describe systems which appear to have many things in common. This applies particularly when attempting a precise description of dynamics (i.e., when the system is no longer at equilibrium), and when the temperature of the system is low, but noticeably greater than absolute zero. For any potential applications, such as in precision measurement of surface forces, time and frequency standards, and even the possible elucidation of gravitational effects beyond those described within Einstein's general theory of relativity, a thorough, predictive understanding of finite temperature in a non-equilibrium configuration will be essential, as well as being of fundamental physical interest. We have therefore chosen to hold the workshop FINESS, which will have an outstanding international roster of leading scientists in their fields in Durham, September 2009. This is a great opportunity for UK physics, notably for junior workers in the field attending the workshop.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Work of the kind stimulated by the workshop may have later knock-on effects in the development of technologies, for example taking advantage of ultracold, quantum-degenerate atomic and molecular gases within a new generation of precision measurement devices, e.g., for the measurement of surface forces, and fundamental tests of general relativity and the the standard model (for which prototype experiments are already either in place or under construction). For this, a thorough understanding of phenomena associated with finite temperature and non-equilibrium effects in the quantum degenerate and superfluid systems which are the subject of FINESS 2009 will be essential. Holding a high-profile meeting will contribute to the prestige of the UK as a centre of scientific excellence. An aid to this end will be the planned intention to generate an edited volume addressing the themes of the workshop in a unified manner, based on discussions to be held at this meeting. We have submitted a book proposal to World Scientific, which is currently at the refereeing stage. We also note that holding a successful international workshop contributes to making the UK an attractive destination for leading international scientists. Facilitating this mobility can reasonably be seen as an important contribution to UK culture. The workshop will also provide excellent training at an opportune stage for those late-stage UK postgraduate students and early-stage UK postdoctoral researchers for which we have reserved places. Depending on the career trajectories of these junior researchers, the benefits of this training may ultimately be felt by not only by academia, but also business or industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19285</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FINESS 2009 (Finite Temperature Nonequilibrium Superfluid Systems)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3956B173-83A3-4B25-83D8-82CB674700C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a workshop held at Van Mildert College, Durham in 2009, on on such topics as kinetic equations, classical field theory, Kadanoff-Baym equations, projected Gross-Pitaevskii equations, the truncated Wigner approximation, Positive P, 2PI, etc., in particular as applied to cold, trapped atomic and molecular gases, but also on solid state systems that can be treated in a formally similar way. This was the first FINESS workshop, but has since become a biennial fixture.

This was an academic activity; the most significant impact was that this since became a regular biennial, international meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1423195899.8583222b850712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>poster presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://massey.dur.ac.uk/finess/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The purpose of this grant was to provide significant funding to a workshop, on the behaviour of superfluid and related systems within cold atom and related configurations.

As such this grant has had a substantial impact on the scientific culture, and furthermore produced well-recieved book surveying a broad cross-section of very useful theoretical methodologies.
