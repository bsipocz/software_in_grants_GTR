A key topic, we believe, is creativity and specifically late-life creativity. Our primary set of questions is: what is 'late-life creativity'? How might we define it? And in what ways is it different from creativity at earlier phases of life? We will explore these questions by bringing together scholars in arts and humanities and in critical gerontology, along with creative artists and performers, social care practitioners, and older people. The network will be shaped by four themed workshops focused on: identity and discipline; 'late style'; memory; and community. \n\nIn recent years, gerontologists have explored new lifestyles in later life and their implications for understanding community and well-being; while in literature and theatre, art history, and music, there has been a critical focus on the limitations of common understandings of old age in the assessment of late-life creative output - there has, for instance, been a steadily growing interest in ideas of 'late style', that is, of the relationship between writers', artists' or composers' final works, the style of those works in relation to their earlier output, and the practicalities of their creativity in old age and/or the proximity of death - and, in reminiscence theatre, practitioners have worked with people across different generations to create new understandings of the past and of late-life creativity. These different modes of research and creativity have worked to similar ends but in parallel and rather frustratingly out of contact with each other. The point of the proposed network is to bring them together, so that new understandings of late-life creativity will emerge from critical dialogue and will be able to cross boundaries.\n\nOur proposal represents an opportunity for arts &amp;amp; humanities scholars both to influence policy and practice in gerontology and to learn from the traditions of gerontological research, which has always sought to translate ideas into actions designed to enhance social inclusion. For this reason, the dialogues we propose will include not only academics in the two fields but writers, performers, older people involved in creative activity and those involved in the theory and practice of old-age care. The ideas developed will be translated into outcomes that can be widely understood and help give shape to future interdisciplinary research and policy thinking. This, in turn, we believe, will help create new openings for HE's engagement with later life and specifically with late-life creativity, both in research and in practice. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network we propose has significant impact potential precisely because it will draw together, and place in dialogue, a very broad range of people involved in a variety of ways with questions of the long life, of ageing, and of late-life creativity: arts &amp;amp; humanities scholars from a range of disciplinary perspectives and traditions (literature, theatre &amp;amp; performance studies, art history, musicology); archivists, creative artists and performers; social scientists (sociologists, gerontologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists); social care practitioners; and older people as both practitioners and consumers. This mix has, we believe, the potential to generate genuinely wide-ranging social impact. In other words, the network offers the prospect of impact on a wide range of beneficiaries and users who will be as diverse as the discussants comprising the workshops. They include: \n\n(1) later life activists, advocates and performers who will be able to take the insights of the research back into the community networks in which they are already active and engaged;\n(2) professional performers and artists, with outstanding reputations and international profiles, whose consciousness of the issue of creativity in later life will have been raised, and which could raise the profile of the issue, and the research, through future discussions and events in which they will participate;\n(3) carers, who will be able to develop new strategies for understanding and implementing the positive role that creativity in later life can play, even and especially in situations where cognitive impairment seems to have had a regressive effect on selfhood;\n(4) curators of archives, galleries and museums, who over time might be encouraged to see their collections as health-promoting resources, stimulating cultural reflexivity through a raised awareness of late life creativity;\n(5) Medical and health professionals, whose reflexivity and critical awareness will be enhanced by exposure to accessibly expressed key traditions of humanistic thought, and new knowledge formations such as medical humanities; and\n(6) policy makers, who are planning the development of communities and physical resources for people in later life, and who can take the fruits of this research into account.\n\nWe believe, then, that the network has the potential to make a positive impact on the nation's health and culture; it also has the potential to develop valuable, research-informed and well-targeted guidance on public expenditure. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28530</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of events in 2016/17 celebrating the long and remarkable creative lives of Pat Albeck and Peter Rice. Pat Albeck is one of the leading textile designers in modern Britain; the late Peter Rice (d.2015) was one of the preeminent stage and costume designers in modern British opera and theatre. Pat Albeck remains a highly active creative artist in her mid 8os: Peter Rice was an active creative artist right up until the moment of his sudden death at the age of 86 during the planning of the exhibition. The lives of both artists were an opportunity to explore careers spanning 60 years, from the 1950s to the present, and to celebrate later life creativity through examples of 'late style' work. For example, a reproduction of Peter Rice's stunning mural painting, 'A Bright Past for Stoke-on-Trent' (2013) was an important and much admired exhibit.
The exhibition was developed in partnership with Emma Bridgewater Ltd; Matthew Rice (son of Peter Rice and Pat Albeck, husband of Emma Bridgewater) granted us unique access to the family archives. In addition to the main exhibition mounted in the exhibition space at Chancellor's Building, Keele University, an adjunct exhibition on Peter Rice's work was mounted at the New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, and was launched through a theatre design discussion forum in front of an audience; the Ages and Stages Elders' theatre company, based at the New Vic performed their piece 'Our Lives as Art' at Keele; an interactive installation based on the exhibition's themes by Keele's Community Animation and Social Innovation Centre was established in Keele's Media Building; a textile design forum in which Emma Bridgewater conversed before an audience with Pat Albeck was held in Keele Hall; a documentary film about the lives of Pat Albeck and Peter Rice was screened at the Westminster Theatre, Keele. 
The research/creative team was led by Professor David Amigoni and Professor Fiona Cownie; it included Ms Kerry Jones (curator), Dr Pawas Bisht, Dr Rebecca Leach, Dr Ceri Morgan, Dr Liz Poole, Professor Mihaela Kelemen (CASIC), Professor Mim Bernard, Ms Jill Rezzano (New Vic Theatre), Lis Evans (New Vic Theatre)</gtr:description><gtr:id>CE432A11-F722-4FA8-B74F-7D8CE0D3F07C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was featured as a leading contribution to the launch of Stoke-on-Trent's bid to become UK City of Culture, 2021 (http://www.sot2021.com/news); the focus on ageing and culture will be important to the bid

It will focus on 'The Ages and Stages' project on ageing and theatre; and also the AHRC-funded 'Late-Life Creativity' project, conducted in partnership with King's College, London. As Desmond O'Neill commented, late-life creativity 'is of great importance to clinicians and society alike' (Lancet, Nov 28, 2015) and the talk took the idea of 'late style' in order to explore, but also perhaps seek to reconcile, different approaches to evaluating the place of art works and art practices in older people's lives. To undertake to explore an artist's 'late style' is to suggest, perhaps, expert historical knowledge of the kind that the art historian and curator Sam Smiles brought to his recent exhibition of 'Late Turner'. This kind of knowledge and approach sits perhaps in tension with Andrew Newman's participative, audience-focused approach to the everyday viewing of art by older people. My talk will explore the ways in which an approach to a 'late style' work (the large mural 'A Bright Past for Stoke on Trent', displayed at the Emma Bridgewater Factory, Lichfield Street, Hanley) of an older artist, the eminent theatre designer Peter Rice, may play a role in reconciling these approaches, and realising the significance of later-life creativity that O'Neil envisions.
The talk was attended by a multi-disciplinary audience (medical humanists, literary specialists, art historians, gerontologists); the talk lasted for 45 minutes and stimulated 30 minutes of intense questioning and discussion.
The talk was a contribution to a collaborative partnership that Amigoni and other colleagues at Keele University are building with the Emma Bridgewater Co., in particular Emma Bridgewater's parents-in-law, the artists and designers Peter Rice and Pat Albeck. A major exhibition celebrating the careers of the couple, and in particular their continuing artistic activity into later life, and to be entitled 'Vintage Now', will be held at Keele (and the New Vic Theatre) in November 2016 (Peter Rice died suddenly in December 2015, prompting a re-focus but with no change to the timetable).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df222c29b4f0.82143658</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://humanitiesandhealth.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/david-amigoni-comes-to-kings-7-december-2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A talk to a meeting (at London, Europa House Smith Square) of the Ransackers Association, an educational organisation for intergenerational learning.

Amigoni has addressed a prominent older peoples' educational organisation (Ransackers); they have both addressed a large pre-concert audience at the Royal Festival Hall on the topic of late style (February 2016, London Philharmonic Orchestra). McMullan developed this occasion through the considerable resources of the Shakespeare400 festival, of which he is academic director. Some of the ideas about late style which our research network helped to advance have been exhibited through the curatorial and commentary work of Professor Sam Smiles in the exhibition 'Late Turner: Painting Set Free' (Tate Gallery, London, Sept 2014-January 2015). Smiles collaborates with McMullan and Amigoni and is an important member of the research network. At present, Amigoni's work is in the form of public engagement activities. We would expect this research to mature as the source of a deeper impact in the coming year as it helps, conceptually, to shape Keele University's partnership work with the Emma Bridgewater Ltd over the 'Vintage Now' exhibition (November 2016), celebrating the artistic and design careers of Pat Albeck and Peter Rice as they continue to produce art in later life. In addition to the exhibition which will take place at Keele University, an accompanying documentary film will be produced; along with theatrical/social animation work on creativity and later life delivered in partnership with the New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme: Jill Rezzano, educational director, was also a member of the network. This narrative will be further developed and updated in future submissions.

Late-life creativity is a key concept for expanding and adding meaning to the 'active ageing' agenda. 'Creativity' stresses the act of placing something new, and of value, in the world. When creativity is associated with older people, it challenges, by definition, unthinking deficit models of the ageing process. 
2. By bringing arts and humanities academic experts into dialogue with experts in social and cultural gerontology, as well as with artists and creative practitioners in later life, our network developed new intellectual resources for thinking about creative approaches to ageing effectively and reflectively. Our discussions provided evidence of important relationships of continuity between 'creative' approaches to arts such as dance, literature, music-making, artistic production and consumption, as well as activities that are not normally regarded as 'artistic' such as community activism and organisation. 
3. Narrative self-fashioning is a vital tool in the promotion of this sort of self-understanding. The so-called 'cultural turn' in gerontology is an especially insightful approach to the understanding of late-life creativity.
4. Our critical and deconstructive approach to 'late style' in literature, art and music, which challenged the individualistic, genius model of artistic production, consequently opened up a more democratic way of understanding late-life creativity admitting of more artistic practices; as well as collaborative practices of co-creation. These challenges could derive equally from historical and critical approaches to art, as well as from culturally-sensitive approaches to neuroscience.
5. Late-life creativity is specific to particular communities of practice and belonging (such as a locality), including communities marked by distinctive cultural or international markers of identity. Those communities may also consist of older people who experience cognitive challenges or losses (such as dementia), but who may still participate in artistic activities precisely because of the caring and collaborative activities of a community.
6. Late-life creativity has great potential to be cultivated as a valuable reflective practice in therapeutic and even clinical settings.
